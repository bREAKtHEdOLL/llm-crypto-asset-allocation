2024-08-16 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reaching levels near $59,600, which suggests a strong recovery from earlier lows. However, the technical indicators remain bearish, with no clear buy signals from moving averages or momentum indicators. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to historic lows, which is typically a bullish signal, yet technical patterns suggest potential downside risk unless a breakout occurs. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether continues to show bullish momentum, indicating a preference for stability amidst uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price surge, technical indicators remain bearish. However, the strong recovery suggests a cautious optimism, warranting a slight positive allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — The drop in gas fees is a bullish indicator, but the potential downside risk from the rising-wedge pattern tempers enthusiasm. A modest positive allocation is justified.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Solana remains neutral. No clear signals to adjust the current allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical shifts keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position. No compelling reason to alter exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the recent price surges in BTC and potential bullish signals in ETH, there is a slight shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for high stablecoin exposure."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600. However, the macroeconomic environment remains mixed, with stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility in traditional markets. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to five-year lows, potentially signaling a bullish outlook, although technical patterns suggest caution. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news-driven changes, while Tether remains stable with bullish technical signals. The current macroeconomic indicators suggest a relatively stable environment, with no immediate signs of high volatility or risk aversion.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price surge, the lack of strong technical buy signals and low on-chain activity suggest a moderate increase in allocation, supported by positive price momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees indicates potential bullish sentiment, but caution is warranted due to technical patterns suggesting possible downside risk. A moderate increase is justified.

SOL: +0.2 — While there is no significant news, the consistent bullish momentum signal and recent price increase suggest a slight positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate given the current market conditions.

USDT: -0.3 — The stablecoin shows bullish technical signals, but given the positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is warranted to capitalize on potential upward movements in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-16 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, indicating a strong reversal from earlier lows. However, Bitcoin's mining profitability has hit all-time lows, which could weigh on long-term sentiment. Ethereum has seen a significant drop in gas fees, typically a bullish indicator, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have shown slight price increases but lack significant news to drive momentum. Tether remains stable, with no significant changes in market conditions or news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The recent price surge and reclaiming of higher levels suggest positive momentum, though mining profitability concerns temper enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees is a bullish sign, but caution is warranted due to the potential technical correction risk.

SOL: +0.2 — Bullish momentum is supported by technical indicators, although the lack of significant news limits the strength of the signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a slight price increase and activity surge, the absence of significant news or strong technical signals suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted."
2024-08-16 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, which indicates a strong reversal from previous lows. However, mining profitability is at an all-time low, which could impact long-term sustainability. Ethereum is showing a bullish outlook with gas fees at a 5-year low, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but Solana's technical indicators show bullish momentum. USDT remains stable, with no significant news, but its technical indicators suggest a buy signal, reflecting a cautious market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price surge and positive sentiment, the low mining profitability tempers enthusiasm. The overall trend is positive, but caution is advised.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees is a bullish signal, but the potential downside risk from the rising-wedge pattern suggests a moderate allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Bullish momentum is present, but without significant news, the allocation should be cautious and incremental.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment in BTC and ETH, some capital rotation out of USDT is warranted, but maintaining a significant stablecoin position is prudent in this mixed market environment."
2024-08-16 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some positive signals. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, which suggests a strong reversal from previous lows. However, mining profitability remains a concern due to the rising hashrate. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to five-year lows, which is historically a bullish signal, but there is a potential downside risk due to a rising-wedge pattern. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news, but Solana maintains bullish momentum. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggests a cautiously optimistic market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite the mining profitability issue, Bitcoin's recent price surge and increased on-chain activity indicate a positive outlook. The strong reversal from July lows adds to the bullish sentiment.

**ETH: +0.3** — The drop in gas fees is a bullish signal, although the potential downside risk from the rising-wedge pattern tempers enthusiasm. Overall, Ethereum shows moderate positive momentum.

**SOL: +0.4** — Solana's consistent bullish momentum in technical indicators and stable on-chain activity support a positive allocation, despite the lack of significant news.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Dogecoin shows no significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance in the absence of compelling signals.

**USDT: -0.3** — With the overall market showing signs of optimism and capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.8. The S&P 500 is strong, suggesting a risk-on sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into crypto markets. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge, although mining profitability concerns may temper enthusiasm. Ethereum shows a mixed technical picture with low gas fees potentially signaling bullish sentiment, but a rising-wedge pattern suggests caution. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana shows consistent bullish momentum in technical indicators. USDT remains stable, but its technical indicators suggest a buy signal, indicating some market participants may be seeking safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the mining profitability concerns, Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong on-chain activity suggest continued interest and potential upside.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees is a positive sign, but the potential technical correction warrants a cautious approach. Overall sentiment remains slightly bullish.

SOL: +0.6 — Consistent bullish momentum in technical indicators and a strong market cap position make Solana an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance. No strong signals to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — While technical indicators suggest a buy, the overall market sentiment leans towards risk-on, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-16 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong price surge of about 5%, reclaiming levels near $59,600. This upward movement is supported by bullish momentum signals and increased on-chain activity. However, Bitcoin mining profitability has hit all-time lows, which could pose a longer-term concern. Ethereum has experienced a significant drop in gas fees, often a precursor to upward price movement, though technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana is showing positive technical indicators with a buy signal, while Dogecoin maintains bullish momentum without significant news. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, which supports risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and price surge, coupled with increased on-chain activity, make BTC attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite potential downside risks from technical patterns, the significant drop in gas fees and bullish momentum support a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators, including a buy signal, suggest a favorable environment for SOL, despite the lack of significant news.

DOGE: 0.0 — While maintaining bullish momentum, the absence of significant news and relatively stable price movements suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-08-16 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong upward momentum, reclaiming levels near $59,600. This is supported by a surge in on-chain activity and bullish momentum indicators, despite a backdrop of low mining profitability. Ethereum also displays a bullish outlook due to historically low gas fees, although there is a technical warning of a potential correction. Solana is experiencing positive momentum with a buy signal from trend indicators, while Dogecoin shows consistent bullish momentum but lacks significant news catalysts. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and a moderate S&P 500 index, suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, supported by increased on-chain activity. Despite low mining profitability, the price surge suggests continued investor interest.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish outlook from low gas fees, but tempered by technical risks of a potential correction. The overall sentiment remains positive, warranting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive momentum and a buy signal from trend indicators, with stable on-chain activity. While lacking significant news, the technicals support a favorable outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Consistent bullish momentum but no significant news or changes in market data to justify a strong allocation shift. Neutral stance maintained.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2024-08-16 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish inclination. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, driven by a strong reversal from earlier lows. However, mining profitability remains a concern due to rising hashrates. Ethereum's technical indicators suggest potential bullish momentum with falling gas fees, although there is a cautionary note regarding a potential correction. Solana and Dogecoin have shown stable on-chain activity and slight price increases without significant news influences. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, which may support a cautious risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and bullish momentum signals, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment for further gains. However, mining profitability concerns temper the enthusiasm slightly.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the potential downside risk highlighted by technical patterns, the significant drop in gas fees and overall bullish momentum provide a positive outlook, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana exhibits consistent bullish momentum and buy signals, supported by stable on-chain activity. The absence of negative news and positive price movement justify a favorable allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin shows bullish momentum, the lack of significant news and its relatively stable price movement suggest maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish momentum across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge, partially recovering from July lows, although mining profitability concerns persist. Ethereum's gas fees have dropped to historic lows, often a precursor to price increases, but technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have shown consistent bullish momentum without significant news impacts, while USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a moderate risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong price recovery and bullish on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum, although mining profitability concerns warrant caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum supported by low gas fees, but technical risks of a correction suggest a balanced approach.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, with stable on-chain activity, indicate potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, lack of significant news and current portfolio status justify a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — As market sentiment leans bullish, reducing stablecoin holdings to allocate more capital into riskier assets is prudent."
2024-08-16 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing bullish momentum despite some technical caution. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, supported by increased on-chain activity, although mining profitability concerns linger. Ethereum's gas fees have hit historic lows, which is often a precursor to price increases, though a potential technical correction looms. Solana maintains a steady bullish trend with consistent on-chain activity, while Dogecoin shows bullish momentum but lacks significant news catalysts. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and moderate interest rates, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum, though mining profitability concerns warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite potential technical risks, the significant drop in gas fees and bullish momentum support a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish signals and steady on-chain activity make Solana an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is bullish momentum, the lack of significant news or unique catalysts keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive momentum in risk assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capture potential gains."
2024-08-16 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news but maintain positive momentum signals. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a moderate U.S. dollar index, suggesting a neutral backdrop for risk assets. Given these conditions, a balanced approach with a slight tilt towards risk assets seems appropriate, while maintaining some exposure to stablecoins for risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong price recovery and positive momentum indicators suggest further upside potential, despite mining profitability concerns.

ETH: +0.3 — While low gas fees indicate potential bullish sentiment, technical risks warrant a cautious approach. Maintain exposure with a slight increase.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana's consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity support a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in sentiment. Maintain a neutral stance given the lack of clear directional signals.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals across major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in risk assets."
2024-08-16 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge of approximately 5%, signaling a potential bullish reversal from recent lows. However, the macroeconomic context remains mixed, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggesting a stable yet uncertain environment. Ethereum's declining gas fees could indicate a bullish outlook, but technical patterns suggest caution. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, while Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Recent price surge and strong on-chain activity suggest a bullish outlook, although mining profitability concerns warrant some caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Declining gas fees are a positive indicator, but potential technical correction risks temper enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite a lack of significant news, consistent on-chain activity and a slight volume increase support a modestly positive stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive signals in BTC and ETH, capital rotation out of stablecoins is favored."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of recovery after a recent price surge, despite challenges in mining profitability. Ethereum's low gas fees suggest a potential bullish outlook, although technical patterns indicate possible downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but their recent price movements show some volatility. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, which may support a gradual increase in risk appetite among crypto investors. Overall, the market is showing signs of recovery, but caution is warranted due to mixed technical signals and potential corrections.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong on-chain activity indicate a positive momentum, although mining profitability concerns may limit upside potential.

ETH: +0.3 — While low gas fees suggest a bullish outlook, technical risks of a correction warrant a cautious approach. The overall sentiment remains slightly positive.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent price fluctuations, the lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, Dogecoin remains a hold with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment leans towards cautious optimism, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets like BTC and ETH."
2024-08-16 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong reversal from recent lows, supported by a significant price surge. However, Bitcoin mining profitability is at an all-time low, which could impact long-term sustainability. Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, with falling gas fees suggesting potential bullish momentum, but a rising-wedge pattern indicates possible downside risk. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana is experiencing some technical weakness. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a steady S&P 500, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and bullish momentum signals suggest continued upward potential, despite concerns about mining profitability.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical patterns indicate potential downside, the drop in gas fees and overall bullish sentiment provide a moderate buy signal.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and technical weakness suggest a neutral stance, with no clear direction in the short term.

DOGE: 0.0 — Absence of significant news and mixed technical indicators result in a hold position, reflecting uncertainty in market sentiment.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish signals in BTC and ETH, there is a moderate preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-16 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of recovery and Ethereum experiencing a reduction in gas fees, which historically signals potential upward movement. However, technical indicators for Ethereum suggest possible downside risks. Bitcoin's recent price surge and Ethereum's low gas fees provide a bullish backdrop, but concerns about mining profitability and technical patterns introduce caution. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, and their technical indicators suggest a neutral to bearish outlook. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility, supports a moderate risk appetite, though the S&P 500's high level indicates potential market overvaluation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong technical indicators suggest a bullish outlook, despite concerns about mining profitability. The overall market sentiment is supportive.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum's low gas fees are bullish, the potential downside risk from the rising-wedge pattern tempers enthusiasm. The mixed technical signals warrant a cautious positive stance.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's technical indicators show no bullish signals, and the price is below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating a potential breakdown. Lack of significant news adds to the uncertainty.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral. The recent activity surge does not translate into a clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with potential upside."
2024-08-16 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong price surge of approximately 5%, reclaiming levels near $59,600. This upward momentum is supported by bullish technical indicators, despite the challenges faced by miners due to low profitability. Ethereum also displays a positive outlook, with gas fees at a five-year low, which historically precedes price increases. However, there is a potential downside risk due to a rising-wedge pattern. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but their technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on environment, encouraging a slight shift away from stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive price action, supported by bullish technical indicators and recent price surge news, make BTC an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite potential downside risks from a rising-wedge pattern, the significant drop in gas fees and historical patterns suggest a bullish outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators, such as being below the lower Bollinger Band, suggest a hold position with no immediate changes in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance with no current holdings to adjust.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of increased risk appetite, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to allocate more capital into other assets with positive momentum."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin leading the charge with a recent price surge of approximately 5%, pushing it near $59,600. This upward momentum is supported by strong technical indicators and on-chain activity, despite a reported decline in mining profitability. Ethereum also shows potential for upward movement, with gas fees at a five-year low, although a technical pattern suggests potential downside risk if it fails to break above $2,800. Solana and Dogecoin have shown price increases but lack significant news or strong technical signals to support a bullish outlook. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, which could support continued risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and positive technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive allocation in the current market environment.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum shows bullish potential with low gas fees, the risk of a technical correction tempers enthusiasm. However, the overall sentiment remains positive.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a slight price increase, Solana lacks strong technical or news support, resulting in a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's recent price increase is not backed by significant news or technical indicators, leading to a neutral allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish sentiment in the market, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with growth potential."
2024-08-16 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, supported by a recent price surge of approximately 5%. Despite this, Bitcoin mining profitability has hit all-time lows, which could pose a longer-term risk. Ethereum is experiencing a bullish outlook due to historically low gas fees, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana's technical indicators remain neutral. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with low volatility, which is generally supportive of risk assets, but the high U.S. dollar index may exert some pressure on crypto prices. The stablecoin USDT remains a safe haven, but the current market environment suggests a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin's strong price momentum and on-chain activity indicate a favorable environment for further gains. The recent price surge and bullish technical indicators support a strong buy signal.

**ETH: +0.5** — While Ethereum shows bullish momentum with low gas fees, the potential downside risk from the rising-wedge pattern tempers enthusiasm. However, the overall sentiment remains positive.

**SOL: 0.0** — Solana's technical indicators are neutral, with no significant news to drive sentiment. Maintaining a hold position is prudent given the lack of clear signals.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Despite some price increases, Dogecoin lacks significant news or technical signals to justify a change in allocation. A neutral stance is appropriate.

**USDT: -0.5** — With the market showing signs of optimism and risk appetite increasing, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is reasonable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-16 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge of approximately 5%, driven by strong upward momentum and positive on-chain activity, despite a challenging environment for miners. Ethereum is also showing bullish momentum with historically low gas fees, although there is a technical warning of a potential correction. Solana and Dogecoin have shown minor price increases, but lack significant news or strong technical signals. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady S&P 500, suggesting a cautious but optimistic risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum and price breakout signals, supported by recent price surges and positive on-chain activity. Despite mining profitability concerns, the overall sentiment remains bullish.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is supported by low gas fees, although caution is warranted due to potential technical correction signals. The overall outlook remains positive.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's price has increased slightly, but lacks significant news or strong technical signals. The asset remains neutral with a slight positive bias due to general market bullishness.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin has shown some price increase, but lacks significant news or strong technical indicators. The asset remains neutral.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a rotation of capital out of stablecoins like USDT into riskier assets, reflecting increased risk appetite."
2024-08-16 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge of approximately 5%, driven by strong bullish momentum and technical indicators. However, the macroeconomic environment remains mixed, with moderate volatility and stable gold prices, suggesting a balanced risk environment. Ethereum's technical indicators and reduced gas fees suggest potential bullish momentum, although a rising-wedge pattern indicates possible downside risk. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news or strong technical signals, while Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive price action, supported by technical indicators and recent price surge news, make BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite potential downside risks, the drop in gas fees and bullish momentum suggest a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance, with no compelling reason to adjust allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum, the absence of significant news and mixed technical indicators result in a hold recommendation.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases with positive sentiment in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is justified to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, reclaiming levels near $59,600 after a significant price surge. This is supported by bullish technical indicators, despite challenges in mining profitability. Ethereum is experiencing a favorable environment with historically low gas fees, suggesting potential upward movement, although technical patterns indicate a possible correction risk. Solana and Dogecoin have shown mixed signals with no significant news to drive sentiment. The broader macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced risk approach, with potential for growth in major cryptocurrencies while maintaining some exposure to stablecoins like USDT for risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong price surge and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum. The price breakout above Bollinger Bands supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Low gas fees and bullish momentum provide a positive outlook, but caution is warranted due to potential technical correction risks.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and lack of significant news suggest a neutral stance. No strong catalyst for movement.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the absence of significant news and mixed volume data suggest maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive momentum in major cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of higher-risk assets."
2024-08-16 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, despite mining profitability challenges. Ethereum is showing bullish potential with historically low gas fees, although technical patterns suggest caution. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana's technical indicators suggest a lack of bullish momentum. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish environment. The S&P 500's stability and low VIX indicate a relatively calm broader market, which may support risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's strong price recovery and bullish momentum signals suggest it remains an attractive asset, despite mining profitability concerns.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical patterns suggest caution, the significant drop in gas fees and potential for upward movement make Ethereum moderately attractive.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators suggest a neutral stance on Solana for now.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintaining a neutral position on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall mixed but cautiously optimistic sentiment in the market, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to allocate more into risk assets like BTC and ETH seems appropriate."
2024-08-16 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong price recovery and positive momentum signals, despite the challenges in mining profitability. Ethereum's technical indicators suggest potential for both upward movement and downside risk, with historically low gas fees hinting at a bullish outlook. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana's technical indicators show a lack of bullish momentum, while Dogecoin maintains a positive trend signal. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a moderate risk-on environment, but the U.S. Dollar Index remains relatively strong, which could temper some of the bullish sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong momentum indicators suggest continued upward potential, despite mining profitability concerns. The macro environment supports moderate risk-taking.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum shows bullish potential with low gas fees, the technical setup warns of possible downside. A cautious positive stance is warranted given mixed signals.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators suggest a neutral stance. No clear signals to increase or decrease exposure.

DOGE: +0.1 — Despite low on-chain activity, Dogecoin maintains a positive trend signal. A slight positive allocation reflects this, though without strong conviction.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally positive market sentiment and risk-on environment, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets is appropriate."
2024-08-17 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility in the S&P 500 and a moderate U.S. dollar index. Bitcoin is showing signs of potential bullish momentum, supported by historical patterns suggesting a Q4 rally post-halving. Ethereum is facing resistance at $2,700, with recent ETF disappointments weighing on sentiment. Solana's market is clouded by regulatory uncertainty following the removal of ETF filings. Dogecoin is experiencing positive sentiment due to increased whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough above resistance levels. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with historical patterns suggesting a potential Q4 rally, make Bitcoin an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance at $2,700, Ethereum's technical indicators remain bullish. However, the underperformance of Ether ETFs tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: 0.0 — The lack of bullish technical signals and uncertainty from the removal of ETF filings suggest a neutral stance on Solana for now.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from whale accumulation and a breakthrough above resistance levels indicate potential for further price appreciation, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals in other assets and a stable macro environment, there is an opportunity to rotate capital out of USDT and into more promising assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally based on historical patterns and recent price behavior. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a risk-on sentiment, although the U.S. dollar remains strong. Ethereum faces resistance around $2,700, with mixed signals from recent ETF performance. Solana's market is experiencing uncertainty due to regulatory delays in ETF approvals. Dogecoin shows signs of bullish momentum, supported by significant whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid these dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a Q4 rally, coupled with strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity, suggests a positive outlook. The macro environment also supports risk-on assets.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and technical buy signals, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainty and lack of bullish technical indicators suggest caution. However, no strong sell signal due to existing holdings.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and a technical breakout above resistance indicate potential for further gains, making it relatively attractive.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally risk-on sentiment and potential for gains in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on market opportunities."
2024-08-17 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price movements. Ethereum, while experiencing a rally, faces resistance and mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana faces uncertainty with ETF filing removals, which could dampen investor enthusiasm. Dogecoin shows signs of potential growth with increased whale accumulation and breaking through resistance levels. The macroeconomic environment, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a balanced risk approach, with some capital rotation into riskier assets like BTC and DOGE, while maintaining a stable position in USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a Q4 rally and historical election-year patterns suggest a favorable outlook. Strong on-chain activity supports this view.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite recent price gains, Ethereum faces resistance and mixed sentiment from underperforming ETFs, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — The removal of ETF filings introduces uncertainty, and technical indicators do not show strong bullish signals, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and breaking resistance levels indicate potential for further gains, making it attractive for capital allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets like BTC and DOGE."
2024-08-17 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

The current macroeconomic environment shows stable conditions with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.75. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally post-halving and some election-year volatility. Ethereum is facing resistance at $2,700, with underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs dampening enthusiasm. Solana's market sentiment is affected by the removal of ETF filings, creating uncertainty. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to increased whale accumulation and breaking short-term resistance, suggesting potential for further gains. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with positive on-chain activity and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and current market conditions.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum is facing resistance and mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs, suggesting caution despite bullish momentum indicators.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana is experiencing uncertainty due to ETF filing removals, with no clear bullish signals from market data, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased whale accumulation and breaking resistance levels indicate potential for further price appreciation, though overall market activity remains low.

USDT: -0.5 — With potential bullish trends in BTC and DOGE, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-08-17 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with low volatility in the S&P 500 and a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index. Bitcoin is exhibiting strong bullish momentum with historical patterns suggesting a potential Q4 rally, supported by increased on-chain activity. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with recent ETF disappointments potentially dampening enthusiasm. Solana's outlook is clouded by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin is experiencing increased whale accumulation, indicating reduced sell pressure and potential for price gains. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with positive historical patterns suggesting a Q4 rally.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum. However, ETF underperformance tempers enthusiasm, leading to a cautious positive stance.

SOL: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainty surrounding ETF filings introduces risk, and technical indicators do not show strong buy signals, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and recent technical breakouts suggest potential for further price appreciation, supporting a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in major cryptocurrencies and potential rallies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally as it follows historical post-halving patterns. However, the market is also experiencing volatility linked to macroeconomic events like the U.S. presidential election cycle. Ethereum faces resistance around $2,700, and its ETFs are underperforming, which may dampen enthusiasm. Solana's ETF prospects are uncertain due to regulatory delays, while Dogecoin shows signs of accumulation by large holders, indicating potential upward movement. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT remain a safe haven amidst the mixed signals across other assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential Q4 rally and strong technical indicators suggest a favorable outlook, despite election-related volatility.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing resistance and underperforming ETF expectations, leading to a neutral stance as it struggles to break key levels.

SOL: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainty surrounding Solana ETFs introduces caution, though technical indicators remain somewhat positive.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and recent resistance breakthroughs provide a bullish signal, suggesting potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With signs of optimism in the broader market, there's a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more promising assets."
2024-08-17 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context presents a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500. Bitcoin is showing bullish momentum with potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical halving-year trends and election-year volatility patterns. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700 and underperformance of Ether ETFs, suggesting a cautious outlook. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by the withdrawal of ETF filings, introducing uncertainty. Dogecoin is experiencing positive sentiment due to increased whale accumulation and breaking through short-term resistance. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and bullish news sentiment.

ETH: -0.1 — Facing resistance and underperformance of ETFs, suggesting a cautious approach despite bullish momentum signals.

SOL: 0.0 — Uncertainty from ETF filing withdrawals offsets bullish momentum, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from whale accumulation and breaking resistance, indicating potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-17 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. Bitcoin shows potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent bullish technical indicators. Ethereum faces resistance around $2,700 and has underperformed expectations with its ETFs, suggesting a cautious outlook. Solana's ETF prospects have been delayed, creating uncertainty, while Dogecoin shows signs of bullish momentum with increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough of resistance levels. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's technical indicators are bullish, and historical patterns suggest a potential rally. The macro environment is stable, supporting further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum faces resistance and ETF underperformance, balancing its bullish momentum with caution, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.1 — The removal of ETF filings introduces uncertainty, and despite bullish momentum, the lack of a buy signal suggests a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough of resistance levels indicate potential for further gains, supporting a positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-17 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by positive momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin is showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and bullish technical indicators. However, Ethereum faces resistance around $2,700 and underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs, suggesting a more cautious outlook. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by regulatory uncertainties surrounding ETF approvals. Dogecoin is experiencing increased whale accumulation, indicating potential for price appreciation. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a moderate risk-on environment, though the U.S. dollar index remains relatively strong, which could cap upside potential for cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Strong bullish momentum and historical patterns suggest potential for a Q4 rally. Positive on-chain activity further supports a favorable outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, resistance around $2,700 and disappointing ETF performance warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainty from ETF filing withdrawals creates a cautious outlook, despite bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and breaking through resistance suggest potential for further gains, supported by bullish momentum.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally positive sentiment in the crypto market, there's a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into higher-risk assets."

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential rally patterns in Q4, supported by historical post-halving trends. Despite some volatility linked to macroeconomic events like the U.S. CPI data and upcoming presidential elections, Bitcoin maintains a bullish momentum. Ethereum, while experiencing a rally, faces resistance at $2,700 and mixed sentiments due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's market is clouded by regulatory uncertainties following the removal of ETF filings, while Dogecoin benefits from increased whale accumulation and breaking through short-term resistance. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a moderate risk appetite, favoring growth assets over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with positive news about potential Q4 rallies, make BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum indicators suggest a cautious buy, though tempered by ETF underperformance.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainties and lack of strong buy signals suggest a hold position, as the market waits for clearer direction.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive technical signals and news of increased whale accumulation support a moderate buy, with potential for further price increases.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential growth in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns post-halving and election-year volatility. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, with mixed signals from underperforming ETFs. Solana's sentiment is dampened by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin benefits from significant whale accumulation and breaking through resistance levels. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with no significant changes in interest rates or volatility, suggesting a steady environment for risk assets. 

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with historical patterns suggesting a potential rally. On-chain activity is robust, supporting a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum. However, the underperformance of ETFs tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory delays in ETF approvals introduce uncertainty, balancing out the bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and breaking through resistance levels suggest potential for further gains, supported by bullish momentum.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there's a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-08-17 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally as analysts draw parallels with historical post-halving patterns. However, the market is also experiencing volatility linked to macroeconomic factors such as the U.S. presidential election cycle. Ethereum faces resistance near $2,700, with underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs dampening enthusiasm. Solana's market sentiment is negatively impacted by the removal of ETF filings, introducing uncertainty. Dogecoin shows positive momentum with increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough of short-term resistance, suggesting potential for further gains. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive momentum and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and increased on-chain activity, make BTC attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, resistance near $2,700 and disappointing ETF performance suggest a neutral stance as the market digests these developments.

SOL: -0.2 — The removal of ETF filings introduces uncertainty, and low on-chain activity suggests caution, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough of resistance levels indicate potential for further upside, making DOGE relatively attractive.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more promising assets."
2024-08-17 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.75. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally following historical patterns, despite recent choppy movements linked to macroeconomic events like the U.S. presidential election cycle. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs dampening sentiment. Solana's prospects are clouded by regulatory delays in ETF approvals. Dogecoin shows bullish signs with significant whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough above resistance levels. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential Q4 rally and strong on-chain activity suggest a favorable outlook, despite recent volatility linked to macro events.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum faces resistance and ETF disappointment, its technical indicators remain bullish, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory setbacks in ETF filings introduce uncertainty, balancing out the bullish momentum signals in technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance suggest potential for further gains in the short term.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment in the market, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential bullish opportunities in other assets."
2024-08-17 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally despite recent volatility linked to macroeconomic events like the U.S. CPI data and the upcoming presidential election. Ethereum has shown resilience but faces short-term resistance, with recent ETF disappointments weighing on sentiment. Solana's prospects are clouded by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin is experiencing positive momentum due to increased whale accumulation and a technical breakout. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a moderate risk environment, potentially favoring risk-on assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a Q4 rally and historical election-year patterns suggest a favorable environment for growth, supported by strong on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's consistent buy signals and bullish momentum indicate a positive outlook, though tempered by ETF-related sentiment.

SOL: +0.1 — While regulatory delays pose challenges, Solana's technical indicators show bullish momentum, warranting a cautious positive stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's recent breakout and significant whale accumulation suggest strong upward potential, making it an attractive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With a moderate risk environment and positive signals across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential gains."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.75. The crypto market is experiencing a generally positive sentiment, with most assets showing slight price increases and bullish technical indicators. Bitcoin is showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and current price movements. Ethereum is facing resistance at $2,700, with mixed news regarding ETFs. Solana has seen a positive price movement despite regulatory uncertainties surrounding ETF filings. Dogecoin is experiencing a bullish trend, supported by whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance. Tether remains stable without significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive historical patterns and potential Q4 rally, coupled with consistent buy signals, suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum's technical indicators remain bullish, though ETF news tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and recent price increases, despite ETF filing setbacks, indicate potential for continued growth.

DOGE: +0.7 — Strong buy signals and whale accumulation suggest a bullish outlook, with potential for further price appreciation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-08-17 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of potential upward movement. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential Q4 rally pattern, supported by historical post-halving trends, though it faces volatility linked to the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Ethereum has seen a rally but is facing resistance around $2,700, compounded by underwhelming performance of Ether ETFs. Solana's market outlook is clouded by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin is buoyed by significant whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough of short-term resistance. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's historical patterns and potential Q4 rally provide a positive outlook. On-chain activity supports this sentiment.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance and ETF disappointment, Ethereum's technical indicators remain bullish, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty regarding ETF filings tempers enthusiasm, despite recent bullish momentum and activity surges.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and a technical breakout suggest potential for further gains, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-08-17 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential rally pattern, supported by historical trends and recent price movements, although it faces volatility linked to macroeconomic events like the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum has shown resilience with a recent rally, but it faces resistance around $2,700 and underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs. Solana's momentum is tempered by regulatory uncertainties surrounding ETF approvals. Dogecoin is benefiting from significant whale accumulation and recent price breakouts, suggesting potential for further gains. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid these developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and current bullish technical indicators. However, caution is warranted due to election-related volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's bullish momentum and recent price increases suggest a moderate positive outlook, though tempered by ETF performance concerns.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's bullish momentum and recent activity surges are promising, but regulatory uncertainties regarding ETF filings limit the upside potential.

DOGE: +0.5 — Strong whale accumulation and recent price breakouts above resistance levels indicate a positive outlook, with potential for further price appreciation.

USDT: -0.4 — In a market showing signs of bullishness, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets is advisable, as investors seek higher returns."
2024-08-17 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of potential upward movement. Bitcoin is experiencing some volatility, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the U.S. presidential election cycle and historical post-halving patterns suggesting a possible Q4 rally. Ethereum, while showing bullish momentum, faces resistance near $2,700 and underperformance in its ETFs, which tempers enthusiasm. Solana's market is affected by regulatory uncertainties due to the removal of ETF filings, while Dogecoin is seeing positive momentum from increased whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance levels. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a moderate risk-on approach, but caution is advised due to mixed signals in the broader market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows potential for a Q4 rally with historical patterns and current market conditions supporting a moderate buy signal. However, election-year volatility suggests caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces resistance and underwhelming ETF performance. A cautious buy signal reflects mixed sentiment.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's bullish technical indicators are tempered by regulatory uncertainty from ETF filing removals. Moderate buy signal due to strong on-chain activity.

DOGE: +0.6 — Strong buy signal due to significant whale accumulation and recent breakout above resistance, indicating potential for further price increases.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities."

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with bullish signals across most cryptocurrencies, driven by technical indicators and recent news. Bitcoin shows potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and increased on-chain activity, although it faces volatility due to macroeconomic events like the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum is experiencing resistance around $2,700, with mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's momentum is tempered by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin benefits from significant whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance. USDT remains stable without significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive historical patterns and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for a rally, though volatility remains a concern.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, bullish momentum and on-chain activity support a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish technical indicators and activity, though tempered by regulatory uncertainty regarding ETFs.

DOGE: +0.5 — Strong whale accumulation and recent breakout above resistance indicate potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive signals across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-17 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is exhibiting potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical post-halving trends and current technical indicators. Ethereum, while experiencing a rally, is facing resistance around $2,700, and the underperformance of Ether ETFs is dampening enthusiasm. Solana's market is experiencing uncertainty due to the removal of ETF filings, which could affect investor confidence. Dogecoin is seeing increased whale accumulation, suggesting reduced sell pressure and potential for price gains. The macroeconomic context, with relatively low volatility and stable interest rates, supports a moderate risk-on environment, though the U.S. dollar's strength could pose challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and historical patterns suggest a potential rally. On-chain activity is increasing, supporting a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive. However, the underperformance of ETFs tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: 0.0 — Uncertainty due to ETF filing removals balances the positive technical signals, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and breaking through resistance levels indicate potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally positive market sentiment, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-08-17 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility (VIX at 14.75) and a moderate U.S. dollar index (DXY at 102.27). Cryptocurrencies are experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price movements. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with ETF performance not meeting expectations, which could dampen enthusiasm. Solana faces regulatory delays with ETF filings, introducing uncertainty. Dogecoin shows signs of accumulation and recent price breakthroughs, suggesting potential upward movement. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Historical patterns and potential for a Q4 rally, combined with positive on-chain activity, suggest a favorable outlook despite recent price fluctuations.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, Ethereum's overall trend remains positive, supported by on-chain activity and technical indicators, though ETF performance tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite regulatory setbacks, Solana's technical indicators and on-chain activity remain strong, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and recent price breakthroughs indicate potential for further gains, supported by bullish technical signals.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive signals across other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential market gains."
2024-08-17 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the volatility and lack of bullish momentum, the potential for a Q4 rally and historical patterns suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with resistance at $2,700 and underperforming ETFs balance out the bullish momentum, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.1 — The uncertainty from the removal of ETF filings and lack of significant bullish news suggests a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive momentum from whale accumulation and breaking through resistance supports a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-17 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.75. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a positive risk sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price movements. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, with mixed news regarding its ETFs. Solana's ETF prospects have been delayed, creating uncertainty. Dogecoin is experiencing whale accumulation, suggesting potential upward movement. No significant news for USDT, but its stability remains attractive in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price stability. On-chain activity is strong, but momentum signals are mixed.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, and ETF news is disappointing. Despite bullish momentum, the technical resistance tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the ETF filing setback, Solana maintains bullish momentum and strong on-chain activity, suggesting potential for recovery.

DOGE: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and a breakthrough above resistance indicate potential for further gains, supported by bullish momentum.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive sentiment in risk assets like BTC and DOGE, there is a slight preference for reducing stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish technical signals, particularly in short-term moving averages. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential Q4 rally pattern, supported by historical post-halving trends and election-year volatility. Ethereum, while showing bullish momentum, faces resistance around $2,700 and underwhelming ETF performance. Solana faces uncertainty due to ETF filing removals, but maintains strong on-chain activity. Dogecoin benefits from increased whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough in resistance levels. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive historical patterns and technical signals suggest a potential rally, supported by increased on-chain activity and market sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $2,700, bullish momentum and technical indicators support a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong on-chain activity and bullish technical signals, though tempered by ETF-related uncertainty.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a recent resistance breakthrough indicate potential for further price appreciation.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential upside in riskier assets."
2024-08-18 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of upward momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout, supported by increased on-chain activity, although its dominance is expected to be capped around 60%. Ethereum faces mixed signals, with whale sell-offs raising short-term concerns despite bullish technical indicators. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space, but the upcoming token unlock could pressure its price. Dogecoin is seeing a significant increase in active addresses, hinting at potential price rallies. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows potential for a breakout with increased on-chain activity and a positive trend signal, despite dominance concerns.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are bullish, recent whale sell-offs introduce caution, warranting a modest positive score.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX activity supports a positive outlook, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk, tempering enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.5 — The surge in active addresses suggests a potential rally, supported by bullish momentum signals.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent."
2024-08-18 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with several assets showing positive technical indicators, such as buy signals from moving averages and bullish momentum in MACD for ETH, SOL, and DOGE. However, there are mixed signals with some assets experiencing slight price decreases in the last hour. Bitcoin's dominance is expected to be capped, which may limit its upside potential. Ethereum faces short-term risks with significant whale sell-offs, while Solana's strong DEX volume share is countered by potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin's increase in active addresses suggests potential for a breakout, but the recent price decrease tempers enthusiasm. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with no significant changes in key indicators like the U.S. dollar index or volatility, suggesting a neutral backdrop for crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite positive technical indicators, the expectation of capped dominance and recent price decrease suggest a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.1 — Bullish momentum is offset by significant whale sell-offs, indicating potential short-term risks.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX volume share and bullish momentum are positive, but upcoming token unlocks pose a risk to price stability.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses hint at potential upside, but recent price decrease warrants a conservative stance.

USDT: 0.0 — Stable macroeconomic indicators and mixed signals across other assets suggest maintaining current stablecoin exposure."
2024-08-18 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of upward momentum and increased on-chain activity. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price increase, breaking above its Bollinger Bands, suggesting potential for further gains. Ethereum, despite some large sell-offs by whales, maintains bullish momentum, driven by ETF optimism. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes, although the impending token unlock could exert downward pressure. Dogecoin is seeing a surge in active addresses, indicating potential for a breakout. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant news or technical signals suggesting a change in its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price increase and breakout above the Bollinger Bands, coupled with high transaction activity, suggest continued bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite whale sell-offs, Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential ETF developments provide a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana shows strong DEX activity, the upcoming token unlock poses a risk, warranting a cautious but positive stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — The significant increase in active addresses and recent price uptick suggest potential for further gains, supporting a positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With rising risk appetite and bullish signals in other cryptocurrencies, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing positive technical indicators despite recent volatility. Bitcoin's price has fluctuated but maintains a buy signal from a trend perspective, although its dominance is not expected to increase significantly. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to large sell-offs by whales, despite bullish momentum signals. Solana is experiencing strong on-chain activity and DEX volume, although upcoming token unlocks may pressure its price. Dogecoin shows increased activity, which could signal a potential breakout. USDT remains stable, with no significant news, suggesting it remains a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain positive, and on-chain activity is strong. However, dominance concerns temper enthusiasm.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but recent whale sell-offs suggest caution. The market is waiting for clearer direction amid ETF optimism.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX activity and positive momentum are encouraging, but the upcoming token unlocks present a potential risk to price stability.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses and potential breakout signals suggest a modest positive outlook, though the overall market impact remains limited.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-18 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows stability with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.7. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows mixed signals with strong on-chain activity but lacks clear momentum. Ethereum faces short-term selling pressure from whales, despite positive long-term ETF prospects. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin shows a potential breakout with increased active addresses, while USDT remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite mixed momentum signals, Bitcoin's strong on-chain activity and overall market stability suggest a modest buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — The recent whale sell-off introduces short-term risks, balancing out the positive ETF sentiment, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's strong DEX volume share is promising, but the upcoming token unlocks warrant caution, resulting in a cautious buy signal.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses hint at potential upward movement, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests a conservative buy.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive risk sentiment and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in USDT is advisable."
2024-08-18 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price increase and is displaying strong technical signals, although its market dominance is expected to remain capped. Ethereum is facing mixed sentiment due to recent whale sell-offs, despite some optimism surrounding ETF developments. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space but faces potential downward pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin is showing increased activity, which could indicate a potential breakout. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and bullish technical indicators suggest continued growth potential, despite capped market dominance.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from recent whale sell-offs and ETF optimism lead to a neutral stance, awaiting clearer direction.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive DEX activity supports growth, but caution is warranted due to upcoming token unlocks that may pressure prices.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a price rally, but the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals in other assets, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-18 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin maintains a buy signal based on technical indicators, although its market dominance is expected to be capped, suggesting limited upside. Ethereum faces short-term sell pressure from whale activity despite positive ETF sentiment. Solana shows strong DEX volume participation, but an upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure. Dogecoin exhibits increased on-chain activity, potentially signaling a breakout. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and no significant changes in traditional markets, which could support a moderate risk-on approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a lack of strong momentum signals, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain positive, and its market position is stable, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent whale sell-offs and mixed technical signals suggest caution, despite long-term optimism around ETF developments.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX volume is a positive indicator, but the upcoming token unlock introduces potential downside risk, justifying a cautious buy.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses hint at potential upward movement, but without strong confirmation, only a slight positive allocation is warranted.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed signals across the crypto market and no significant news, maintaining current stablecoin exposure is prudent for now."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment reflects a cautiously optimistic sentiment, with several assets showing potential for upward movement. Bitcoin maintains a stable position with a buy signal from its short-term moving averages, although its dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed signals with significant whale sell-offs, despite some positive ETF-related sentiment. Solana is experiencing strong on-chain activity, capturing a significant share of decentralized exchange volumes, but faces potential price pressure from a large upcoming token unlock. Dogecoin shows increased activity, which could signal a potential breakout. In contrast, Tether remains stable with no significant news, suggesting a neutral stance amid these market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from technical indicators and increased on-chain activity suggest a moderate opportunity for growth, although dominance is expected to be capped.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite positive ETF sentiment, recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risk, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX activity supports a positive outlook, but the upcoming token unlock introduces potential price pressure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses hint at a potential breakout, providing a moderate positive signal.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market signals, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent to balance risk exposure."
2024-08-18 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with slight upward price movements across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin continues to show a buy signal in its trend, although its momentum remains neutral. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to recent whale sell-offs, despite some ETF optimism. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum and significant activity in decentralized exchanges, though the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure. Dogecoin shows increased activity, potentially signaling a breakout, while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and slight price increases suggest a positive outlook, though momentum is neutral. The market dominance cap news is not immediately concerning.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risk, despite some positive ETF sentiment. The technicals are mixed, warranting caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and significant DEX activity support a positive outlook, though the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased active addresses hint at a potential breakout, supported by slight price increases.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets."
2024-08-18 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing positive momentum and technical indicators. Bitcoin's price is experiencing upward momentum, supported by a surge in on-chain activity, though its market dominance is expected to face a ceiling. Ethereum has seen significant whale sell-offs, which could introduce short-term volatility despite positive technical signals. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space, but the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure. Dogecoin is seeing increased activity, hinting at potential price rallies. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with increased on-chain activity, suggesting continued price appreciation. However, dominance concerns cap the score.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical signals, the recent whale sell-off introduces uncertainty, balancing the outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive DEX activity supports Solana, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk, warranting a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.2 — The increase in active addresses suggests potential upside, but the lack of strong technical signals keeps the score moderate.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment leans towards risk-on, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-08-18 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with high on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin despite dominance concerns.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are positive, recent whale sell-offs introduce caution. However, the potential for ETF approval remains a supportive factor.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong bullish momentum and significant DEX volume share are positive, though the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk that warrants monitoring.

DOGE: +0.3 — The surge in active addresses and slight price increase indicate potential for further gains, albeit with some caution due to mixed technical signals.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, capital can be rotated out of USDT to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across several major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin all experiencing upward momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is seeing strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum, while Ethereum is experiencing a mixed sentiment due to recent whale sell-offs despite positive price movements. Solana is benefiting from significant decentralized exchange activity, although upcoming token unlocks could introduce some price pressure. Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential breakout with increased active addresses and price momentum. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, which supports a risk-on sentiment in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with high on-chain activity, suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, Ethereum's price momentum and potential ETF optimism provide a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and significant DEX volume support a positive allocation, though caution is warranted due to upcoming token unlocks.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses and bullish momentum signal a potential breakout, but the overall market cap and technicals suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2024-08-18 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin all experiencing upward price momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin maintains strong on-chain activity, although its market dominance is expected to be capped around 60%. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs, despite positive ETF-related optimism. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes, though a significant token unlock could introduce selling pressure. Dogecoin is seeing a notable increase in active addresses, suggesting potential for further price rallies. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on environment, which could favor cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and on-chain activity suggest continued bullish momentum, though market dominance concerns slightly temper enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite whale sell-offs, bullish technicals and ETF optimism provide a cautiously positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — High DEX volume share and bullish momentum are positive, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant increase in active addresses and bullish technical indicators suggest potential for further price appreciation.

USDT: -0.5 — In a generally bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-18 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin maintains a strong buy signal despite a slight decrease in price, supported by robust on-chain activity. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to recent whale sell-offs, though technical indicators remain positive. Solana is experiencing strong DEX activity, but the upcoming token unlock could pressure prices. Dogecoin shows increased on-chain activity, hinting at potential price rallies. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a favorable backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and high on-chain activity, though market dominance concerns slightly temper enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite whale sell-offs, technical indicators remain bullish, and ETF optimism provides some support.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive DEX activity is offset by concerns over the upcoming token unlock, warranting cautious optimism.

DOGE: +0.5 — Surge in active addresses and bullish technical indicators suggest potential for a breakout.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-18 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators, but its dominance is expected to be capped, which may limit its upside potential. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs, despite bullish technical indicators. Solana is showing strong on-chain activity and decentralized exchange volume, although upcoming token unlocks could create downward pressure. Dogecoin is experiencing a surge in active addresses, suggesting potential for a breakout. The macroeconomic backdrop remains stable, with relatively low volatility and no significant changes in traditional financial indicators, which supports a moderate risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and on-chain activity suggest bullish momentum, but dominance concerns limit aggressive allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technicals, recent whale sell-offs introduce uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Robust DEX activity and technical signals are positive, but potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses and bullish technicals suggest potential for a price rally, though it's still speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall bullish sentiment and technical signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin maintains a strong buy signal, supported by bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, although its dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs despite positive ETF news, suggesting potential short-term volatility. Solana is gaining traction with a significant share of DEX volumes, but the impending token unlock could exert downward pressure. Dogecoin shows signs of a potential breakout with a surge in active addresses. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals and bullish momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity, although dominance concerns cap potential gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with whale sell-offs countering ETF optimism, suggesting a hold position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive DEX activity supports growth, but the upcoming token unlock poses potential risks, warranting cautious optimism.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses hint at a potential breakout, but the overall market impact remains uncertain.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-18 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and buy signals from technical indicators. Bitcoin's market dominance is expected to remain capped, which may limit its upside potential despite positive momentum signals. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs, which could pose short-term risks despite ongoing ETF optimism. Solana is experiencing strong decentralized exchange activity, but the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure on its price. Dogecoin has seen a notable increase in active addresses, potentially signaling a price rally. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in volatile markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite capped dominance, Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators and remains a relatively stable asset in the portfolio.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risks, warranting a cautious approach despite bullish technical signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX activity supports positive sentiment, but the upcoming token unlock requires careful monitoring.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a price rally, but overall market conditions warrant a moderate approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive sentiment across other assets, some capital can be rotated out of USDT to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-18 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a low VIX, suggesting reduced market volatility, and a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index. However, the recent market data indicates a mixed sentiment across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows a slight decrease in price with mixed signals from technical indicators, while Ethereum is experiencing volatility with significant sell-offs by large holders, despite bullish technical signals. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin shows increased activity, which could signal a potential breakout, while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite mixed signals, Bitcoin maintains a buy trend and bullish momentum in the longer term. The market cap dominance cap might limit upside, but overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's bullish technicals are countered by recent large sell-offs, creating a neutral outlook. The potential for ETF optimism could offset short-term risks.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's strong DEX volume share is positive, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk. The overall sentiment is slightly positive, given its market activity.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a breakout, but recent price decreases and low activity keep the outlook modestly positive.

USDT: -0.4 — With mixed signals across other assets and potential for increased risk appetite, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential opportunities in other assets."
2024-08-18 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 14.7. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals with bullish momentum for several assets, although some concerns remain. Bitcoin shows a strong technical setup but faces skepticism regarding its market dominance. Ethereum is experiencing sell-offs by large holders, which could indicate short-term risks despite positive sentiment around potential ETFs. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin shows increased activity, suggesting potential for price movement. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite skepticism about market dominance, Bitcoin's technical indicators are strong, and it remains a relatively safe bet in the current environment.

ETH: -0.3 — The recent sell-off by whales introduces short-term risk, and while there is optimism around ETFs, caution is warranted given the volatility.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX volume share is positive, but the upcoming token unlock could pressure prices, warranting a cautious but positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a breakout, but the lack of significant price movement keeps the signal moderate.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capture potential upside elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators and on-chain activity. Bitcoin maintains a steady position with a buy signal from short-term moving averages, although its dominance is not expected to rise significantly. Ethereum faces some short-term risks due to large sell-offs by whales, despite ongoing optimism about potential ETF developments. Solana is experiencing strong decentralized exchange activity, but an upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure on its price. Dogecoin shows signs of potential breakout with a significant increase in active addresses. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from technical indicators and stable on-chain activity suggest moderate confidence in Bitcoin's potential for gains, despite limited dominance growth.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum shows bullish momentum, the recent whale sell-off introduces some caution. However, the ETF optimism provides a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX activity supports Solana's growth, but the upcoming token unlock is a potential risk. The current technical indicators still warrant a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.4 — The significant increase in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally, supported by bullish technical signals.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the generally positive market sentiment and risk appetite, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to allocate more capital to other assets with growth potential."
2024-08-18 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators and on-chain activity. Bitcoin maintains a strong technical buy signal, although its dominance is expected to be capped, suggesting a balanced outlook. Ethereum faces mixed signals, with large holders selling off amid price volatility, yet there remains optimism around potential ETF developments. Solana is experiencing significant activity in decentralized exchanges, although the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure. Dogecoin shows potential for a breakout with an increase in active addresses, while Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a capped dominance, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain positive, and it serves as a relatively stable asset in the current market environment.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing short-term sell pressure from whales, the potential for ETF developments and consistent bullish momentum provide a cautiously optimistic outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX activity supports a positive outlook, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk, warranting a moderate allocation increase.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a price rally, but technical indicators remain neutral, justifying a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.4 — With overall market sentiment leaning towards risk-on, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets is prudent."
2024-08-18 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a relatively calm market backdrop. Bitcoin's technical indicators are mixed, with a lack of strong momentum despite a buy trend signal. Ethereum faces short-term risks due to whale sell-offs, although its technical indicators remain bullish. Solana shows strong decentralized exchange activity, indicating robust network usage, but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin's recent increase in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally, although its technical indicators are weak. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, Bitcoin remains a relatively stable asset with potential for dominance growth, albeit capped. Its current market position warrants a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — The recent whale sell-off introduces short-term risk, offsetting bullish technical signals. Hold current position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX activity supports Solana's network value, but upcoming token unlocks could pressure prices. A cautious buy is warranted.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a rally, but technical indicators are weak. A small increase in allocation is justified to capture potential upside.

USDT: -0.2 — With mixed signals across other assets, maintaining some liquidity in USDT is prudent, but a slight reduction is appropriate to capitalize on potential growth in other assets."
2024-08-18 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.7. The overall market sentiment for cryptocurrencies is mixed, with Ethereum experiencing significant whale sell-offs despite some bullish technical indicators. Solana shows strong on-chain activity, particularly in decentralized exchange volumes, but faces potential downward pressure from a large upcoming token unlock. Bitcoin maintains a steady trend without significant bullish momentum, while Dogecoin sees a notable increase in active addresses, suggesting potential for a price rally. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin shows stable price action with a consistent buy signal from moving averages, but lacks strong momentum. The market dominance cap news suggests limited upside, so a moderate positive score is appropriate.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent whale sell-off introduces short-term risk. The mixed sentiment warrants a cautious stance with a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX activity supports Solana's attractiveness, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk. A moderate positive score reflects this balance.

DOGE: +0.1 — The surge in active addresses hints at potential bullish momentum, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests a conservative increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant changes in the macro environment or news, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent as it serves as a stable anchor in the portfolio."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable yet cautious sentiment, with the U.S. Dollar Index and S&P 500 indicating moderate confidence in traditional markets. Cryptocurrencies are experiencing mixed signals: Bitcoin is facing potential resistance in market dominance, while Ethereum is seeing significant whale sell-offs despite ETF optimism. Solana is gaining traction in DEX volumes but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin shows increased activity, hinting at potential upward movement, though technical indicators remain weak. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Market dominance concerns also weigh on sentiment.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite whale sell-offs, the long-term outlook remains neutral due to mixed technical indicators and ETF optimism.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX activity is a positive sign, but potential price pressure from token unlocks tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a breakout, though technical indicators are not yet supportive.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed signals across other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-19 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bearish indicators across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, while SOL shows some resilience. BTC is under pressure from macroeconomic factors, such as anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, which may provide some long-term optimism but currently face bearish technical signals. ETH is experiencing significant outflows from ETFs, reflecting weakening institutional demand. SOL is seeing substantial outflows from investment products, though developments in DeFi use cases may provide a longer-term positive outlook. DOGE shows increased network engagement despite price declines, and USDT remains strong, benefiting from its stability and recent expansion onto the Aptos blockchain.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite long-term holding sentiment, current technical indicators and low on-chain activity suggest caution in the short term.

ETH: -0.1 — ETF outflows and lack of bullish momentum signal a cautious approach, though the long-term potential remains intact.

SOL: +0.2 — While facing significant outflows, the expansion in DeFi use cases and technical buy signals suggest moderate potential for recovery.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased network activity is offset by bearish technical indicators, resulting in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of bearish signals in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-19 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.65. The anticipation of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve has stirred optimism in the crypto markets, particularly for Bitcoin, despite recent price declines. Ethereum is facing pressure from significant ETF outflows, while Solana has experienced record investment outflows, likely due to decreased interest in meme-coin trading. Dogecoin shows increased network engagement despite stagnant prices, and Tether remains strong with new blockchain integrations and high DeFi revenue. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some assets facing specific challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, the anticipation of Fed rate cuts and strong on-chain holding sentiment suggest potential for a rebound. The macro context supports a moderate increase in BTC allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — The significant ETF outflows and mixed sentiment from Vitalik's transactions create uncertainty, balancing out any potential upside from broader market optimism.

SOL: -0.3 — The record outflows from Solana products indicate a bearish sentiment, outweighing the positive news of expanded DeFi use cases. Reducing exposure is prudent given current market conditions.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and active addresses suggest potential for upward movement, though price action remains stagnant. A slight increase in allocation is warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential capital rotation into riskier assets due to market optimism, reducing USDT exposure aligns with the current sentiment shift towards growth assets."
2024-08-19 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bearish technicals, the potential for a Fed rate cut and strong long-term holding sentiment provide a modestly positive outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — ETF outflows and institutional demand concerns weigh on sentiment, though the technical picture is not overly bearish.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite significant outflows, new DeFi use cases could support future growth, warranting a cautious positive stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased network activity is positive, but price action remains stagnant, suggesting a hold position.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets and strong DeFi performance, maintaining a stablecoin buffer is prudent in the current environment."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment suggests a cautious optimism in the crypto markets, driven by potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could boost risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows resilience with a significant portion of its supply remaining dormant, indicating strong holder conviction. Ethereum faces headwinds from substantial ETF outflows, reflecting waning institutional interest. Solana is experiencing notable outflows from investment products, but its DeFi ecosystem is expanding with new use cases. Dogecoin's network activity is increasing, suggesting growing engagement despite price stagnation. Tether remains a stable anchor, with recent developments enhancing its utility across new blockchain platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite technical indicators not showing strong buy signals, the macroeconomic context and dormant supply suggest a positive outlook. The anticipation of rate cuts could further support BTC's price.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant ETF outflows and mixed sentiment from institutional investors weigh on Ethereum, despite a stable technical outlook. This warrants a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.2 — The large outflows from Solana products indicate a bearish sentiment, although the expansion of DeFi use cases provides some support. The overall sentiment remains cautious.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network activity and engagement provide a slight positive bias, despite the lack of strong price movement or technical signals.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of the current market uncertainty and potential for volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-08-19 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward momentum driven by expectations of future Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, Ethereum faces headwinds due to significant ETF outflows and reduced institutional interest. Solana and Dogecoin exhibit mixed signals, with Solana experiencing substantial outflows from investment products but also expanding its DeFi use cases. Dogecoin sees increased network engagement despite stagnant prices. Tether remains a stable choice, benefiting from its recent launch on the Aptos blockchain and leading DeFi revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The anticipation of Fed rate cuts and strong on-chain holding patterns suggest a positive outlook, though technical signals remain neutral.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and reduced institutional interest weigh on sentiment, despite stable technical indicators.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with large outflows from investment products counterbalanced by positive developments in DeFi use cases.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement is a positive sign, but price action remains stagnant, warranting a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.2 — Despite the stablecoin's strong position in DeFi, a slight preference for riskier assets is emerging, though maintaining some USDT exposure is prudent given market uncertainties."
2024-08-19 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve fostering a positive outlook for cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Despite this, technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and SOL remain bearish, with no clear buy signals. Ethereum faces additional pressure from significant ETF outflows, while Solana experiences substantial investment outflows, although its DeFi ecosystem is expanding. Dogecoin shows strong network engagement despite stagnant prices, and Tether continues to solidify its position in the DeFi space with significant revenue generation and new blockchain integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite bearish technicals, the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts and strong on-chain holding patterns support a moderately positive outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and bearish technical indicators suggest caution, although long-term potential remains.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from investment products and bearish technicals warrant a cautious approach, despite expanding DeFi use cases.

DOGE: 0.0 — Strong network engagement is offset by stagnant price action and bearish technicals, resulting in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish signals in other assets, maintaining a moderate allocation in USDT is prudent for stability."
2024-08-19 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context suggests a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.65. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing resilience due to potential Fed rate cuts and a large portion of its supply being dormant, indicating strong holding sentiment. Ethereum faces pressure from significant ETF outflows, while Solana is experiencing substantial investment outflows despite expanding DeFi use cases. Dogecoin sees increased network engagement, although its price remains stagnant. Tether continues to solidify its position in the DeFi space with new blockchain integrations and high revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the potential for Fed rate cuts and strong holding sentiment suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh on Ethereum, suggesting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Record outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, though expanding DeFi use cases provide some support.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased network activity is offset by stagnant price action, resulting in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of mixed market conditions and potential volatility, maintaining a moderate allocation in USDT provides a safe haven for capital preservation."
2024-08-19 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing a mix of optimism due to potential Fed rate cuts and long-term holding patterns, but technical indicators remain weak. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from significant ETF outflows and a lack of institutional demand. Solana is seeing significant outflows from investment products, although its DeFi ecosystem is expanding. Dogecoin shows increased network engagement despite stagnant prices, while Tether remains stable with strong DeFi revenue and new blockchain integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite weak technical indicators, the potential for Fed rate cuts and strong long-term holding patterns provide a modestly positive outlook.

ETH: -0.2 — Significant ETF outflows and weak institutional demand create a bearish sentiment, though technicals are neutral.

SOL: -0.1 — Large outflows from investment products weigh on sentiment, but expanding DeFi use cases provide some support.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement is a positive sign, but price stagnation limits the upside.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a safe haven amid uncertainty."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with a moderate U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a neutral backdrop for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows signs of resilience, with a significant portion of its supply being held long-term, indicating bullish sentiment despite no immediate technical buy signals. Ethereum faces headwinds from substantial ETF outflows, which could weigh on its price in the short term. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, yet its DeFi ecosystem is expanding, which may offer long-term potential. Dogecoin sees increased network engagement, but this hasn't translated into price momentum. Tether remains a stronghold in the DeFi space, with new developments on the Aptos blockchain and leading revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, the long-term holding pattern and potential Fed rate cuts provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant ETF outflows and Vitalik's recent transactions suggest caution, with potential downward pressure on prices.

SOL: -0.2 — While Solana's DeFi use cases are expanding, the large outflows from investment products indicate potential short-term weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased active addresses suggest network strength, but without corresponding price movement, a neutral stance is warranted.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-19 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with macroeconomic factors such as potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve providing some optimism for the crypto market. However, technical indicators across most assets remain bearish, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals not showing bullish momentum. Bitcoin shows some resilience with a significant portion of its supply being held long-term, suggesting underlying bullish sentiment. Ethereum faces pressure from significant ETF outflows, while Solana sees substantial investment outflows, although there is some positive news with new DeFi use cases. Dogecoin shows increased network engagement despite price stagnation. Tether remains strong, with new blockchain integrations and leading DeFi revenue generation, indicating its continued importance in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bearish technicals, the long-term holding pattern and potential macroeconomic support provide a moderately positive outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and bearish technicals suggest caution, although long-term potential remains.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from investment products overshadow positive DeFi developments, suggesting a cautious stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased network activity is positive, but it is not yet translating into price momentum, warranting a neutral position.

USDT: +0.2 — With mixed market signals and potential volatility, maintaining some stablecoin exposure as a hedge is prudent."
2024-08-19 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.65. The U.S. Dollar Index is stable, and gold prices are high, which may signal cautious investor sentiment. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows signs of potential bullish sentiment due to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant portion of its supply remaining dormant, indicating strong holding behavior. Ethereum faces headwinds from significant ETF outflows, impacting its price negatively. Solana has experienced substantial outflows from investment products, although new DeFi use cases are emerging. Dogecoin's network engagement is increasing despite stagnant prices, and Tether continues to expand its presence and revenue in the DeFi space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate buy signals, the anticipation of Fed rate cuts and strong holding behavior among investors suggest potential upward momentum.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh on Ethereum, with technical indicators showing potential breakdowns.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, although new DeFi developments provide some support.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased network engagement is positive, but price stagnation and lack of strong buy signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.3 — In the current environment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent due to mixed sentiment across other assets and Tether's strong DeFi revenue performance."
2024-08-19 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a moderate U.S. Dollar Index, which could support risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, although expanding DeFi use cases provide some support.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement with a surge in active addresses suggests potential for future price movement, despite current stagnation.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility, while Tether's strong DeFi performance supports its attractiveness."

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a rebound due to anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could boost crypto markets. However, Ethereum faces headwinds from significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand, while Solana experiences substantial investment outflows despite expanding DeFi use cases. Dogecoin shows strong network engagement with a surge in active addresses, suggesting underlying interest despite stagnant prices. Tether remains robust, launching on the Aptos blockchain and leading DeFi revenue, indicating strong demand for stablecoins amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts and strong on-chain holding patterns suggest a moderate buy signal, despite lack of short-term technical buy signals.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and institutional demand concerns weigh on Ethereum, justifying a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, though expanding DeFi use cases provide some support, warranting a slight reduction.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and active addresses suggest potential for upside, supporting a modest buy signal.

USDT: +0.4 — Continued demand for stablecoins amid market uncertainty and strong DeFi revenue performance justify maintaining a higher allocation in USDT for stability."
2024-08-19 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some positive developments and underlying bearish signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a rebound in optimism due to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, and a significant portion of its supply remains dormant, indicating strong holding behavior. Ethereum faces challenges with substantial ETF outflows and reduced institutional demand, which weigh on its price. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products but is expanding its DeFi use cases. Dogecoin shows increased network engagement through a surge in active addresses, despite stagnant prices. Tether continues to perform well, launching on the Aptos blockchain and leading in DeFi revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts and strong holding behavior supports a moderate buy signal, despite lack of technical buy signals.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand suggest reducing exposure, though technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: -0.2 — Record outflows from investment products indicate bearish sentiment, despite new DeFi developments; reduce exposure slightly.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement is a positive sign, but price stagnation keeps the signal modestly positive.

USDT: +0.3 — Given mixed market conditions and potential volatility, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity."
2024-08-19 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward momentum driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, technical indicators for most cryptocurrencies remain neutral, with no strong buy signals. Ethereum is experiencing pressure from significant ETF outflows, while Solana faces challenges due to large investment outflows, although there is some positive news regarding new DeFi use cases. Dogecoin is seeing increased network activity, which could indicate growing interest despite stagnant prices. Tether remains a stable choice, with strong performance in DeFi revenue and new blockchain integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive news regarding potential Fed rate cuts and strong on-chain holding patterns suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and mixed sentiment from recent price drops warrant a cautious approach, despite some positive news.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, although new DeFi developments provide a slight positive offset.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network activity suggests growing interest, though price action remains relatively flat.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-19 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with no major shifts in indicators like interest rates or volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite mixed technical signals, the potential for Fed rate cuts and strong holder sentiment provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh on Ethereum's outlook, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — While facing investment outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases and recent price momentum suggest a modestly positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement and active addresses provide a slight positive tilt, though price action remains relatively stable.

USDT: -0.5 — With the potential for increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, a reduction in stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-08-19 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some positive developments and mixed signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a rebound in optimism due to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, and a significant portion of its supply remains dormant, indicating strong holding behavior. Ethereum is facing pressure from substantial ETF outflows and a lack of institutional demand, despite some positive on-chain activity. Solana is seeing significant outflows from investment products, although its DeFi ecosystem is expanding with new prediction markets. Dogecoin shows strong network engagement with a surge in active addresses, though price movement remains stagnant. Tether continues to expand its presence, launching on the Aptos blockchain and leading in DeFi revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.6** — The potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts is boosting optimism, and the high percentage of dormant supply suggests strong holding sentiment, indicating potential for upward movement.

**ETH: -0.3** — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh heavily on sentiment, despite some positive on-chain activity.

**SOL: -0.2** — Large outflows from Solana investment products suggest bearish sentiment, although the expansion of DeFi use cases provides a slight counterbalance.

**DOGE: +0.3** — Despite stagnant prices, the surge in active addresses indicates strong network engagement, which could lead to future price appreciation.

**USDT: +0.2** — While generally a safe haven, the expansion onto the Aptos blockchain and leading DeFi revenue generation suggest maintaining some exposure as a hedge against volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential rebound driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, Ethereum and Solana face challenges, with significant outflows from investment products indicating a lack of confidence. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is seeing increased network activity, which may suggest growing interest despite stagnant prices. Tether remains a stable choice, with its expansion onto new blockchains and strong DeFi revenue generation highlighting its utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive momentum and potential rate cut optimism are driving a bullish outlook, supported by strong on-chain holding patterns.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent ETF outflows and lack of bullish momentum suggest caution, despite slight price increases.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant outflows from investment products overshadow positive DeFi developments, indicating potential short-term weakness.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased active addresses and network engagement provide a positive signal, although price action remains subdued.

USDT: -0.4 — With growing optimism in BTC and increased engagement in DOGE, there is a slight preference to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-19 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward momentum driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, Ethereum faces pressure from significant ETF outflows, reflecting broader sentiment challenges. Solana experiences substantial investment outflows, although new DeFi use cases could provide future support. Dogecoin's network engagement is strong, but price action remains stagnant. Tether continues to expand its utility across blockchains and leads in DeFi revenue, indicating robust demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive momentum and potential rate cuts support a bullish outlook. The dormant supply suggests strong holding sentiment, which is encouraging for long-term growth.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum, significant ETF outflows and mixed sentiment from institutional investors suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.3 — Large outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, despite some positive developments in DeFi use cases. Current holdings should be reduced slightly.

DOGE: +0.2 — Strong network engagement with a surge in active addresses suggests underlying interest, but price stagnation warrants a cautious positive stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With a potential increase in risk appetite, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable, though Tether's strong DeFi performance provides a buffer."
2024-08-19 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of bullish momentum due to expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. This has led to a rebound in BTC prices, supported by a significant portion of its supply remaining dormant, indicating strong holding sentiment. Ethereum, however, faces headwinds from substantial ETF outflows and a general weakening in institutional demand, despite some bullish technical signals. Solana is experiencing mixed signals, with record outflows from investment products countered by new DeFi use cases. Dogecoin is seeing increased network engagement, although its price remains relatively stagnant. Tether continues to dominate DeFi revenue charts and has expanded its reach by launching on the Aptos blockchain, indicating robust demand for stablecoins in the current environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive sentiment from potential rate cuts make BTC attractive, especially with a significant portion of supply being held long-term.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite some bullish technical signals, the substantial ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh on ETH's attractiveness.

SOL: +0.3 — While facing significant outflows, the introduction of new DeFi use cases and positive technical indicators provide a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and bullish momentum suggest a slight positive outlook, though price remains stable.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-19 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and relatively low volatility, which could support risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum with increased on-chain activity and positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts. Ethereum faces challenges with significant ETF outflows, although the broader sentiment remains mixed. Solana is seeing substantial outflows, but new DeFi developments could provide long-term support. Dogecoin is witnessing increased network engagement, suggesting underlying strength despite price stagnation. Tether remains a stable choice, with strong DeFi revenue and new blockchain integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts, along with significant dormant supply indicating bullish investor sentiment.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish momentum, significant ETF outflows and mixed sentiment from institutional investors suggest caution.

SOL: +0.2 — While facing outflows, new DeFi developments on Solana could provide future growth opportunities, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement and active addresses suggest underlying strength, though price remains stagnant.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive sentiment in risk assets and potential capital rotation, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent."
2024-08-19 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential rebound driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Bitcoin's on-chain data also indicates a strong hold by investors, suggesting bullish sentiment. Ethereum faces headwinds due to significant ETF outflows and reduced institutional demand, despite a slight technical improvement. Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, although new DeFi use cases could provide some support. Dogecoin shows increased network engagement, highlighted by a surge in active addresses. Tether remains stable, with expansions into new blockchains and strong DeFi revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts support an increased allocation to Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite a slight technical improvement, significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh heavily on Ethereum's outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — While facing large outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases provide some positive momentum, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement through a surge in active addresses suggests a modestly positive outlook, but the overall impact remains limited.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected, justifying a reduction in exposure."
2024-08-19 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant portion of BTC supply remaining dormant, indicating bullish sentiment. Ethereum faces headwinds due to substantial ETF outflows and mixed institutional demand, while Solana is experiencing significant investment outflows despite expanding DeFi use cases. Dogecoin is seeing increased network engagement, although price action remains relatively stagnant. Tether continues to demonstrate strong performance in the DeFi space, with new blockchain integrations and high revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive news regarding potential rate cuts are driving optimism. The high percentage of dormant supply further supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish technical indicators, significant ETF outflows and mixed news about institutional demand create uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — While facing substantial investment outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases and positive technical signals suggest potential for recovery, albeit with caution.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement and positive technical indicators provide a modestly positive outlook, though the price remains relatively stable.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-08-20 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and positive developments across several cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced significant price increases, supported by trader optimism and expectations of rate cuts. Solana's market sentiment is mixed, with positive developments in Brazil but regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price surge due to social media hype and accumulation by miners. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with bullish technical signals and positive news sentiment, particularly around options activity and rate-cut expectations.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is closely following Bitcoin's rally, with strong technical indicators and supportive news about dovish Fed expectations.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., Solana benefits from positive developments in Brazil and strong technical signals, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's price surge, driven by social media hype and miner accumulation, suggests potential for further gains, justifying a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's minting indicates strong demand, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests a slight rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity related to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable price increases, supported by positive news and technical indicators. Solana's market sentiment is mixed due to regulatory developments, but the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive sign. Dogecoin has seen a price boost from social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's comments. Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, which could support broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding options activity and potential rate cuts support further upside. The technical indicators are aligned with a continued upward trend.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is closely following Bitcoin's upward trajectory, with positive momentum and supportive macroeconomic news. The technical signals remain bullish.

SOL: +0.3 — While regulatory concerns in the U.S. pose some risk, the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. The technical indicators are still favorable.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increases and positive on-chain activity provide a short-term boost, but the lack of substantial fundamental developments suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism surrounding potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity linked to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both rallied approximately 4%, reflecting strong upward momentum. Solana is experiencing mixed signals, with positive developments in Brazil contrasted by regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a notable price increase due to social media hype and miner accumulation. Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand, suggesting potential for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with positive news on options activity and rate-cut expectations, suggesting further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is closely following Bitcoin's bullish trend, supported by dovish Fed expectations, making it attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil provides a positive outlook, though with some caution due to mixed news.

DOGE: +0.5 — Social media-driven price surge and miner accumulation indicate positive sentiment, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile cryptocurrencies is advisable."
2024-08-20 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-08-20 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and positive developments in the crypto space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both seen price surges, supported by substantial options activity and dovish expectations from the Fed. Solana is experiencing mixed news; while it gains traction in Brazil with a new ETF, regulatory concerns in the U.S. create uncertainty. Dogecoin has benefited from social media hype, notably influenced by Elon Musk's cryptic tweets, leading to a notable price increase. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, which could support broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by positive news and significant options activity. The market is optimistic about Bitcoin's potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Following Bitcoin's lead, Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum and positive sentiment due to dovish Fed expectations.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil provides a positive outlook, though caution is warranted.

DOGE: +0.5 — Social media-driven price surge and miner accumulation indicate strong short-term interest, though the hype may be volatile.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in the market, there is a slight preference to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with notable upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity. Bitcoin's price has surged, nearing $61K, supported by positive news and strong on-chain activity. Ethereum mirrors Bitcoin's rally, benefiting from similar macroeconomic expectations. Solana is experiencing mixed signals due to regulatory developments, but the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive factor. Dogecoin has seen a price jump due to social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's comments. Tether's recent minting activity indicates robust demand, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with bullish technical indicators and positive news sentiment, suggesting a favorable environment for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is benefiting from similar bullish momentum and macroeconomic expectations as Bitcoin, making it attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — While Solana faces regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil provides a positive outlook, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's price surge driven by social media hype and significant miner accumulation suggests a short-term opportunity for gains, warranting a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-08-20 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism surrounding potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity related to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both seen price surges, reflecting positive trader sentiment. Solana's market is experiencing mixed signals due to regulatory developments, while Dogecoin has benefited from social media hype and miner accumulation. Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for USDT, suggesting robust liquidity in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity. The potential for further gains is bolstered by trader optimism and macroeconomic factors.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum is experiencing bullish momentum and favorable market conditions, driven by expectations of dovish Fed signals.

SOL: +0.3 — While regulatory concerns in the U.S. present some uncertainty, the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil provides a positive outlook, supporting modest allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation suggest potential for further gains, warranting a positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish sentiment and risk appetite increasing, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown strong upward momentum, supported by significant options activity and anticipation of rate cuts. Solana is experiencing mixed signals with positive ETF developments in Brazil but regulatory hurdles in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price boost due to social media hype, while Tether's recent minting indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum benefits from positive momentum and dovish Fed expectations, suggesting a favorable environment for growth.

SOL: +0.3 — While Brazilian ETF approval is positive, regulatory concerns in the U.S. temper enthusiasm. However, overall sentiment remains slightly positive.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increase and miner accumulation provide a modestly positive outlook, though the hype may be short-lived.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for holding USDT."
2024-08-20 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.7 — Positive price movement in tandem with Bitcoin, supported by bullish macroeconomic sentiment and technical indicators.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity related to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both shown strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and technical indicators. Solana has seen mixed signals with positive developments in Brazil but regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a price jump due to social media hype and miner accumulation. Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand, potentially signaling broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news around options activity and potential rate cuts support a bullish outlook. Increased on-chain activity further strengthens the case for a higher allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum benefits from positive macroeconomic expectations and strong technical indicators, making it attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil and overall bullish market sentiment provide a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — The recent price surge driven by social media hype and miner accumulation suggests a positive short-term outlook, though with less conviction compared to BTC and ETH.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-20 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing positive momentum driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity. The recent price surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum reflects a broader bullish sentiment, although short-term price fluctuations are evident. Solana faces mixed signals with positive developments in Brazil but regulatory challenges in the U.S., which could impact investor confidence. Dogecoin has experienced a notable price increase due to social media hype and accumulation by miners. Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, suggesting a potential catalyst for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum benefits from similar macroeconomic factors as Bitcoin, with a positive outlook from the anticipated Fed meeting, supporting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana has positive developments in Brazil, regulatory challenges in the U.S. create uncertainty, warranting a cautious but slightly positive stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation provide a short-term boost, but the speculative nature suggests a moderate allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and potential capital rotation into other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable."
2024-08-20 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, which has resulted in a rally for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge is further supported by substantial options activity and trader optimism around macroeconomic developments. Ethereum is following Bitcoin's lead, reflecting a correlated market movement. Solana's market sentiment is mixed, with positive developments in Brazil contrasted by regulatory hurdles in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a price boost due to social media hype and miner accumulation, while Tether's recent minting activity indicates robust demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. The macroeconomic context further supports risk-on assets like BTC.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from the same macroeconomic optimism as Bitcoin, with positive price momentum and correlated market movements. However, slightly less on-chain activity compared to BTC tempers the score.

SOL: +0.3 — While Solana faces regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. The overall market sentiment is supportive, but regulatory uncertainty keeps the score moderate.

DOGE: +0.5 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation provide a bullish backdrop for Dogecoin. The recent price surge and positive sentiment justify a moderate buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the recent minting activity indicating demand, the overall market sentiment is risk-on, reducing the relative attractiveness of holding stablecoins. However, maintaining a neutral position in USDT provides a hedge against potential volatility."
2024-08-20 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum driven by positive macroeconomic expectations, such as potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. This has led to a significant price surge in both assets. Solana is experiencing mixed signals due to regulatory uncertainties in the U.S., despite positive developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a price boost from social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's comments, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, potentially signaling broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is benefiting from strong bullish momentum and positive macroeconomic news, with significant options activity and optimism around the U.S. election boosting trader sentiment.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is riding the coattails of Bitcoin's rally, with expectations of dovish Fed signals supporting its price. However, slightly less momentum compared to Bitcoin justifies a slightly lower score.

SOL: +0.3 — While there are positive developments in Brazil with the approval of a Solana-based ETF, regulatory concerns in the U.S. temper enthusiasm. The mixed news results in a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — The recent social media-driven price jump and miner accumulation provide a short-term boost, but the lack of sustained fundamental changes keeps the score modest.

USDT: -0.5 — Despite the recent minting activity indicating strong demand, the overall market's risk-on sentiment suggests a rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and ETH."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, which has led to a recent rally in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price movement is further supported by significant options activity related to the U.S. election, while Ethereum follows suit with similar bullish momentum. Solana's market is mixed, with positive news from Brazil's ETF approval countered by regulatory hurdles in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a boost from social media hype, particularly due to Elon Musk's influence, and strong on-chain accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests robust demand for stablecoins, potentially setting the stage for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite a recent price dip, Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum from both technical indicators and positive news regarding options activity and potential rate cuts.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum benefits from similar macroeconomic conditions as Bitcoin, with expectations of dovish Fed signals supporting its price, though technicals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news from Brazil's ETF approval supports Solana, although regulatory concerns in the U.S. temper enthusiasm slightly.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation provide a modestly positive outlook, though the recent price drop suggests caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of optimism and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-08-20 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a notable rebound in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve. This optimism is further supported by substantial options activity and rate-cut expectations. Solana's market sentiment is mixed due to regulatory developments, with positive news from Brazil contrasting with regulatory hurdles in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a price boost from social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's cryptic references. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates robust demand for stablecoins, potentially signaling broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive momentum from recent price rebound and strong on-chain activity, supported by optimistic macroeconomic news.

ETH: +0.5 — Price increase in tandem with Bitcoin and positive macroeconomic news, though technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news from Brazil's ETF approval, but tempered by U.S. regulatory concerns. Overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price increase driven by social media hype, but lacks sustained technical or on-chain support.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-08-20 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience, with both assets experiencing a price surge due to trader optimism and potential rate cuts. Solana faces mixed news, with positive developments in Brazil contrasted by regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price boost from social media hype, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and positive news around options activity and rate-cut expectations provide a strong bullish signal. The asset's on-chain activity also supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price movement in tandem with Bitcoin and anticipation of dovish Fed signals suggest a favorable environment, though technicals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil and overall market optimism provide a moderate positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price increases driven by social media hype and miner accumulation suggest some positive momentum, but the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's minting indicates strong demand, the overall market's bullish sentiment suggests a potential rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-08-20 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price movement is closely aligned with Bitcoin, benefitting from the same macroeconomic expectations, though technical signals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive developments in Brazil with the approval of a Solana-based ETF provide a bullish signal, although regulatory challenges in the U.S. temper enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increase and miner accumulation indicate short-term bullish sentiment, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests a moderate allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased optimism in risk assets and recent crypto rallies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of recovery driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and increased options activity. Bitcoin's price surge and Ethereum's parallel movement suggest a potential upward trend, supported by macroeconomic factors. Solana's market is mixed, with positive developments in Brazil contrasting with regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a price boost due to social media influence and miner accumulation, indicating speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether's significant minting activity reflects robust demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by positive macroeconomic news and options activity, indicating potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Following Bitcoin's lead with similar upward momentum and positive sentiment from anticipated Fed actions.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive developments in Brazil could support price, but U.S. regulatory concerns temper enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increase and miner accumulation suggest speculative interest, but lacks strong technical support.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin allocation is warranted."
2024-08-20 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable upward movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and increased options activity. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards $61K, while Ethereum follows closely, reflecting a broader positive sentiment. Solana faces mixed news, with regulatory challenges in the U.S. but positive developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in interest due to social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's comments. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is benefiting from the same macroeconomic factors as Bitcoin, with a significant price increase and positive sentiment, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory hurdles in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, suggesting moderate potential for growth.

DOGE: +0.5 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation indicate a positive short-term outlook, making it worthwhile to maintain or slightly increase exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment and potential for further rallies in other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on risk-on market conditions."
2024-08-20 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing a notable price surge driven by trader optimism and expectations of a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. This positive sentiment is further supported by substantial options activity and the anticipation of rate cuts. Solana's market is experiencing mixed signals, with positive developments in Brazil but regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price jump due to social media hype, particularly from Elon Musk's cryptic references, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests robust demand and potential for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Recent price surge and positive news around options activity and Fed expectations indicate strong bullish sentiment. The overall macroeconomic context supports further upside potential.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's price movement is closely following Bitcoin's upward trend, supported by similar macroeconomic factors and dovish Fed expectations, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. However, the mixed sentiment warrants a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.2 — The recent price jump driven by social media hype and miner accumulation indicates potential short-term gains, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market leaning towards a bullish sentiment, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, prompting a shift of capital into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-08-20 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of recovery driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve. This optimism is further bolstered by substantial options activity around the U.S. election, suggesting increased trader engagement. Solana's market dynamics are mixed, with positive developments in Brazil contrasted by regulatory challenges in the U.S. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has experienced a price boost due to social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's cryptic references. Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially setting the stage for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations provide a bullish outlook. Despite technical indicators not showing a buy signal, the macroeconomic context supports a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum benefits from positive macroeconomic expectations. The alignment with Bitcoin's rally suggests a favorable environment for ETH, warranting a moderate increase.

SOL: +0.3 — While there are regulatory concerns in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. This mixed sentiment suggests a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation signal potential short-term gains. However, the lack of strong technical signals suggests only a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — With increased optimism and potential rallies in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on riskier assets. However, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent given market uncertainties."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of recovery due to expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and increased options activity. Bitcoin's price has surged, driven by trader optimism, while Ethereum has mirrored this movement. Solana faces mixed news, with positive developments in Brazil but regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a price jump due to social media hype, while Tether's recent minting indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies. Despite these positive signals, technical indicators across most assets remain neutral, suggesting a cautious approach to allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive news and price momentum, coupled with increased options activity, suggest a favorable outlook. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderate allocation increase.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum benefits from positive news and price movements. The anticipation of dovish Fed signals supports a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive developments in Brazil are offset by regulatory challenges in the U.S. The overall neutral technical indicators suggest a cautious approach with a slight positive bias.

DOGE: +0.3 — Social media-driven price jumps and miner accumulation provide short-term bullish sentiment, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's minting indicates demand, the overall market sentiment leans towards increasing exposure to riskier assets. A slight reduction in USDT allocation is warranted to capitalize on potential market rallies."
2024-08-20 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, which has led to a recent rally in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Bitcoin's price surge is also supported by substantial options activity related to the U.S. election, while Ethereum follows suit with a similar increase. Solana is experiencing mixed signals due to regulatory developments, with positive news from Brazil contrasting with regulatory pauses in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price jump due to social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's cryptic references. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates robust demand and potential for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The recent price surge and positive sentiment around options activity and potential Fed rate cuts suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, warranting increased exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price movement in tandem with Bitcoin and anticipation of dovish Fed signals provide a positive outlook, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The recent price jump driven by social media hype and accumulation by miners suggests a short-term positive sentiment, supporting a modest increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2024-08-21 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with certain bullish signals emerging amid a generally stable macroeconomic backdrop. Bitcoin's derivatives market indicates a potential short-squeeze, suggesting upside potential, while Ethereum sees strong institutional demand as evidenced by the success of BlackRock’s ETH ETF. Solana's regulatory acceptance in Brazil and Dogecoin's renewed retail interest due to Elon Musk's influence further add to the positive sentiment. However, technical indicators across these assets remain largely neutral, with no significant buy signals. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT and plans for a new stablecoin suggest potential bullish flows, though the macroeconomic environment remains stable with low volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short-squeeze and minimal impact from Mt. Gox BTC transfers suggest a moderate upside, despite neutral technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong institutional demand and potential bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics warrant a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.2 — Regulatory acceptance in Brazil and consistent on-chain activity provide a mild bullish outlook, though technicals remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.1 — Retail interest driven by Elon Musk's influence offers a slight positive, but low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — Stable macroeconomic conditions and recent issuance suggest holding current positions without significant rotation into or out of USDT."
2024-08-21 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.27. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a mixed sentiment with no strong directional trends in the short term. Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and Ethereum's institutional interest through the iShares Ethereum Trust highlight some bullish potential. Solana's regulatory support in Brazil and Dogecoin's renewed retail interest due to Elon Musk's influence suggest positive sentiment for these assets. However, technical indicators across most assets remain neutral to bearish, with short-term moving averages below longer-term ones, indicating a lack of strong buy signals. Tether's expansion with a new stablecoin and significant minting activity suggests a strategic positioning for potential bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite neutral technical indicators, the potential for a short squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers provide a moderately bullish outlook.

**ETH: +0.6** — Strong institutional demand as evidenced by the iShares Ethereum Trust and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply support a positive allocation.

**SOL: +0.3** — Regulatory support in Brazil and consistent on-chain activity provide a slight bullish sentiment, though technical indicators remain neutral.

**DOGE: +0.4** — Renewed retail interest driven by Elon Musk's influence and increased trading activity suggest a positive outlook, despite neutral technical indicators.

**USDT: -0.2** — While Tether's expansion is noteworthy, the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets as market sentiment improves suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-21 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments across several assets. Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze could lead to a sharp upside, while Ethereum's institutional interest is highlighted by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF. Solana's regulatory acceptance in Brazil and recent whale activity suggest mixed signals, while Dogecoin has experienced a surge in retail interest following Elon Musk's social media activity. Tether continues to expand its influence with new stablecoin initiatives, though its recent minting activity suggests a potential bullish flow into the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short squeeze and minimal impact from Mt. Gox BTC transfers provide a positive outlook, despite current technical indicators showing no buy signals.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply suggest a favorable environment for Ethereum, despite neutral technical indicators.

SOL: +0.2 — Regulatory support in Brazil is positive, but recent whale selling activity tempers enthusiasm, leading to a cautious but slightly positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed retail interest driven by Elon Musk's influence and increased trading activity provide a short-term boost, despite the lack of strong technical signals.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish flows into other assets and a generally optimistic market sentiment, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish signals emerging, particularly for Ethereum and Dogecoin. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the significant inflows into the iShares Ethereum Trust, and a potential bullish setup with increased on-chain supply. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and market cap, driven by renewed retail interest following a post by Elon Musk. Bitcoin, while facing potential short-squeeze risks, has not shown significant immediate selling pressure from recent Mt. Gox-related transfers. Solana's market activity is relatively stable, with regulatory developments in Brazil potentially supporting future interest. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of a large volume of USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin typically implies a more defensive allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While technical indicators are neutral, the potential for a short squeeze and limited immediate selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers provide a moderate bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply suggest a favorable environment for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.1 — Regulatory developments in Brazil are positive, but recent whale selling activity tempers enthusiasm, leading to a cautious but slightly positive stance.

DOGE: +0.4 — Increased trading activity and market cap, driven by Elon Musk's influence, indicate a positive sentiment and potential for short-term gains.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the large issuance of USDT, the stablecoin's role as a defensive asset suggests maintaining current exposure without significant changes, given the mixed market signals."
2024-08-21 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish signals emerging amidst generally neutral technical indicators. Bitcoin is seeing potential for an upside due to a crowded short position in the derivatives market, which could lead to a short squeeze. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF, although on-chain supply increases could suggest a potential price rebound. Solana's market is stable with regulatory support from Brazil, but large whale sell-offs could dampen price action. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest and trading activity, largely driven by social media influence from Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of a new stablecoin and significant USDT minting indicate a strategic expansion and potential for liquidity inflows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers provide a moderately bullish outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong institutional demand and potential for a price rebound due to increased on-chain supply support a slightly positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory support in Brazil is countered by large whale sell-offs, resulting in a neutral outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased trading activity and social media-driven interest provide a slight bullish signal for Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential capital rotation towards riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on emerging bullish opportunities."
2024-08-21 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX and a strong performance from the S&P 500. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is facing potential short-squeeze scenarios, which could lead to upward price movements. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF, and a potential bullish setup with increased on-chain supply. Solana is experiencing mixed signals with significant whale selling but positive regulatory developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest and trading activity, driven by Elon Musk's influence. Tether continues to expand its influence with new stablecoin initiatives and significant minting activity, suggesting potential bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers provide a bullish outlook, despite current technical indicators showing no strong buy signals.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup with increased on-chain supply support a positive allocation, despite neutral technical indicators.

SOL: +0.2 — While whale selling is a concern, the approval of another SOL ETF in Brazil is a positive regulatory signal, warranting a cautious positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed retail interest and increased trading activity driven by Elon Musk's influence suggest a moderate positive outlook, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant changes in macroeconomic conditions or market sentiment, maintaining current stablecoin holdings is prudent, especially given the potential for bullish flows."
2024-08-21 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is showing signs of potential upside due to a crowded short position, which could lead to a short squeeze. Ethereum is witnessing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF, and a potential bullish setup due to increased on-chain supply. Solana's market is buoyed by regulatory support in Brazil, although recent whale activity suggests some selling pressure. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in interest and trading volume, largely driven by Elon Musk's influence, indicating heightened retail engagement. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of a significant amount of USDT and plans for a new stablecoin suggest confidence in stablecoin demand, although it may also indicate a cautious approach by investors seeking stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short squeeze and minimal selling pressure from the Mt. Gox transfer create a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite the lack of a strong technical buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply support a positive outlook for Ethereum, even as technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive regulatory developments in Brazil provide a supportive backdrop for Solana, though recent whale selling activity tempers enthusiasm slightly.

DOGE: +0.4 — Renewed retail interest and increased trading volume following Elon Musk's post suggest a short-term bullish sentiment for Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's recent issuance indicates strong demand, the overall market sentiment leans towards a slight risk-on environment, suggesting a modest reduction in stablecoin holdings."

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze due to crowded short positions, which could lead to significant upward price movement. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of the iShares Ethereum Trust, and a potential bullish setup with increased on-chain supply. Solana faces mixed signals with significant whale selling but also regulatory support from Brazil's approval of a second SOL ETF. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and price following a post by Elon Musk, indicating renewed retail interest. Tether continues to expand its reach with new stablecoin initiatives and significant minting activity, suggesting potential bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The potential for a short squeeze and minimal impact from Mt. Gox BTC transfers create a favorable environment for upward movement, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply support a positive outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite whale selling, regulatory support from Brazil's ETF approval provides a slight positive bias, though caution is advised.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading activity and price movement following Elon Musk's post suggest a short-term positive sentiment, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally optimistic market sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing USDT exposure seems prudent."
2024-08-21 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze, supported by a significant reduction in liquidation risk from the Mt. Gox transfer. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF, and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply. Solana faces mixed signals with significant whale selling but also regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest and trading activity, largely driven by Elon Musk's influence. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of a new stablecoin and large recent minting suggest potential bullish flows, though it remains a safe haven amid market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The potential for a short squeeze and reduced selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers create a favorable environment for BTC, despite the lack of a strong technical buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply suggest a positive outlook for ETH, despite recent sideways price action.

SOL: +0.2 — Regulatory support in Brazil is a positive sign, but the significant whale selling tempers enthusiasm. The market remains cautious but slightly positive.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed retail interest and increased trading activity driven by Elon Musk's influence provide a short-term boost, though technical signals remain mixed.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether's recent minting suggests potential bullish flows, the stablecoin remains a neutral holding as risk appetite cautiously increases across other assets."
2024-08-21 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility, suggesting a relatively calm market backdrop. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum with potential for a short squeeze, although the Mt. Gox transfer poses a minor risk. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of BlackRock's ETH ETF, indicating potential for upward movement. Solana faces mixed signals with significant whale selling but also regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin is benefiting from renewed retail interest, partly driven by Elon Musk's influence. Tether's expansion into new stablecoin offerings and recent large minting activity suggest a strategic positioning for future market moves.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the Mt. Gox transfer, the potential for a short squeeze and bullish momentum make BTC attractive. The market seems poised for upward movement.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional inflows and a bullish setup on exchanges suggest a favorable outlook for ETH, despite recent price stability.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals from whale selling and regulatory support in Brazil create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance for now.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased retail interest and trading activity, driven by Elon Musk's influence, provide a moderate bullish signal.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the potential for bullish moves in other assets, reducing USDT exposure aligns with a strategy to capitalize on increased risk appetite."
2024-08-21 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several indicators pointing towards potential bullish movements, especially for BTC and ETH. Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential short-squeeze, which could lead to a sharp upward movement if triggered. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of the iShares Ethereum Trust, and a rise in on-chain supply suggests a possible price rebound. Solana's market is somewhat mixed, with significant whale selling activity, but also positive regulatory developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and price due to renewed interest from Elon Musk's social media activity. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach with a new Dirham-pegged stablecoin and has recently minted a significant amount of USDT, indicating potential bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The potential for a short-squeeze and minimal selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers suggest a strong upward potential. The bullish momentum and recent price increase support this view.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics make ETH attractive. Despite recent price stability, these factors suggest a positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with significant whale selling offset by positive regulatory news in Brazil. The lack of a clear bullish signal in technical indicators suggests a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading activity and price movement driven by social media interest indicate potential short-term gains, though the overall market impact remains speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish flows into other cryptocurrencies, there may be a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT, suggesting a reduction in exposure to capitalize on riskier assets."
2024-08-21 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Tether remains stable with significant minting activity, suggesting potential bullish flows into the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum and the potential for a short squeeze make it an attractive asset in the current environment. The Mt. Gox transfer is unlikely to have a significant negative impact.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand as indicated by ETF inflows and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply make Ethereum appealing, despite mixed technical signals.

SOL: +0.2 — While facing some selling pressure from a major whale, Solana benefits from regulatory support in Brazil, which could help stabilize and potentially boost its price.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price surge and increased trading activity driven by Elon Musk's influence suggest renewed retail interest, making Dogecoin relatively attractive in the short term.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current risk-on sentiment and potential bullish flows into other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT seems prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze due to crowded short positions, suggesting a possible upward price movement. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of the iShares Ethereum Trust, and a rise in on-chain supply could indicate a bullish setup. Solana's market activity is mixed, with significant whale selling countered by regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in interest and trading activity following a post by Elon Musk, indicating renewed retail enthusiasm. Tether's recent issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin typically indicates a more conservative market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The potential for a short squeeze and minimal impact from the Mt. Gox transfer create a favorable environment for BTC, supported by bullish momentum signals.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from on-chain supply increases make ETH attractive, despite the absence of a strong trend signal.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with significant whale selling and no strong technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, despite regulatory support in Brazil.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased retail interest and trading activity following Musk's post provide a positive outlook, though the momentum signal is currently neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and potential bullish flows into other assets, reducing USDT exposure is reasonable, though it remains a stable asset in uncertain conditions."
2024-08-21 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum and potential for a short squeeze, which could drive prices higher. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the significant net inflows into the iShares Ethereum Trust, despite some mixed signals from on-chain activity. Solana's market is somewhat mixed, with large sales from a major whale contrasting with positive regulatory developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in retail interest following a post by Elon Musk, leading to increased trading activity and market cap. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively expanding its offerings, including a new stablecoin pegged to the UAE dirham, which suggests a strategic push into new markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and potential short squeeze in the derivatives market. The Mt. Gox transfer is unlikely to significantly impact the market, supporting a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional demand is strong, as evidenced by the ETF inflows, and the potential for a bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics. However, technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive regulatory news from Brazil supports a slightly bullish stance, but the large whale sell-off tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased retail interest and trading activity following Elon Musk's post provide a short-term boost, though longer-term fundamentals remain unchanged.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-08-21 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly lower, which can be supportive for cryptocurrencies as alternative assets. Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators with a potential short-squeeze scenario, suggesting bullish potential. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF. Solana faces mixed signals with a major whale offloading but also regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest due to Elon Musk's influence, although its technical indicators remain mixed. Tether continues to expand its offerings, indicating potential bullish flows into the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential short-squeeze scenario. News of limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox adds to the bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest is strong with ETF inflows, and on-chain supply dynamics suggest a potential price rebound. However, technical signals are not as strong as BTC.

SOL: -0.2 — Despite regulatory support in Brazil, significant selling by a major whale and technical breakdown signals suggest caution.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge due to Elon Musk's influence and increased trading activity indicate renewed retail interest, but technicals remain mixed.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is likely a rotation out of stablecoins as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-08-21 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500 index, indicating a generally positive risk sentiment. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum, supported by potential short-squeeze scenarios and minimal selling pressure from Mt. Gox-related transfers. Ethereum is experiencing significant institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF, although on-chain supply increases suggest caution. Solana faces mixed signals with significant whale selling but positive regulatory developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in retail interest, driven by social media influence, while Tether's expansion and minting activities suggest increased liquidity in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential short-squeeze scenario, combined with minimal immediate selling pressure from Mt. Gox, make BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ETF inflows are positive, though caution is warranted due to increased on-chain supply. Overall, ETH remains a solid choice given the bullish setup.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale selling and positive regulatory news in Brazil. The lack of clear technical momentum suggests a neutral stance for now.

USDT: -0.4 — With growing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing USDT exposure seems prudent to capitalize on potential upward movements in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-21 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum supported by positive technical indicators and news. Bitcoin's derivatives market signals a potential short squeeze, which could drive prices higher, while Ethereum benefits from strong institutional demand as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF. Solana faces mixed signals, with significant whale selling offset by regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in retail interest, partly driven by Elon Musk's influence, leading to increased trading activity and market cap. Meanwhile, Tether's recent issuance of USDT and plans for a new stablecoin indicate a strategic expansion, although the overall market seems to be shifting towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and news of a potential short squeeze. The Mt. Gox transfer is unlikely to exert significant selling pressure.

ETH: +0.7 — Positive momentum with institutional interest and potential bullish setup due to increased on-chain supply. The ETF milestone further supports upward movement.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale selling countered by regulatory approval for a new ETF in Brazil. No clear direction for now.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased retail interest and trading activity following Elon Musk's post suggest potential for further gains, though the impact may be short-lived.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market shows a bullish tilt, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins into riskier assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-08-21 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with notable upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by potential short-squeeze scenarios and minimal selling pressure from recent large transfers. Ethereum is also seeing positive sentiment, driven by significant institutional inflows into the first ETH ETF and a potential bullish setup indicated by on-chain supply dynamics. Solana's market activity is mixed, with some selling pressure from a major whale but also positive regulatory developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in interest and trading activity, partly fueled by social media influence, while Tether's recent issuance of USDT suggests a potential increase in market liquidity and risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential for a short squeeze make BTC highly attractive. The minimal impact from Mt. Gox transfers further supports a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics provide a positive outlook for ETH. The ETF milestone is a significant confidence booster.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite some selling pressure from a major whale, regulatory support in Brazil and stable technical indicators suggest a cautiously optimistic view.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading activity and positive sentiment driven by social media influence indicate a moderate bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into riskier assets, a reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on bullish trends in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-21 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price is experiencing a notable increase, supported by potential short-squeeze risks in the derivatives market, while Ethereum is seeing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of BlackRock's ETH ETF. Solana shows mixed signals, with a major whale selling off a significant amount of SOL, but regulatory developments in Brazil could provide some support. Dogecoin is benefiting from renewed retail interest, partly driven by social media influence from Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although it remains a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Strong upward momentum, supported by potential short-squeeze risks and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers, indicates a favorable environment for Bitcoin.

**ETH: +0.7** — Institutional demand and bullish on-chain signals suggest Ethereum is well-positioned for further gains, despite some recent supply increases on exchanges.

**SOL: +0.2** — While there is some selling pressure from a major whale, regulatory support in Brazil and overall market bullishness provide a modest positive outlook.

**DOGE: +0.5** — Renewed retail interest and increased trading activity, driven by social media influence, suggest potential for further price appreciation.

**USDT: -0.5** — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there's a shift away from stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in more volatile assets."
2024-08-21 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is generally bullish across most major cryptocurrencies, with strong upward momentum and positive technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing potential short-squeeze conditions, which could lead to a sharp price increase. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of the iShares Ethereum Trust. Solana, however, shows mixed signals with significant whale selling activity but also regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in interest and trading volume, partly driven by social media influence. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin means it remains a safe haven during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals and potential short-squeeze conditions indicate a bullish outlook. The Mt. Gox transfer news is unlikely to have a significant negative impact.

ETH: +0.7 — Institutional interest and a potential bullish setup due to increased on-chain supply support a positive allocation, despite recent price stability.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed signals with whale selling and regulatory support. The overall market environment is bullish, but Solana's specific signals are less clear.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased trading activity and positive sentiment driven by social media influence suggest a favorable short-term outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — While USDT remains a stable asset, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests a slight reduction in exposure to allocate more capital to higher-performing assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short-squeeze scenario, which could lead to a sharp price increase. Ethereum is benefiting from strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the significant inflows into the ETH ETF, despite a recent increase in on-chain supply. Solana's market is mixed, with a major whale selling off a significant amount of SOL, but regulatory support in Brazil remains a positive factor. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and price following a post by Elon Musk, indicating renewed retail interest. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin typically limits direct price appreciation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is displaying strong upward momentum, supported by potential short-squeeze dynamics and a significant on-chain transaction that is unlikely to result in immediate selling pressure.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand is robust, as indicated by the ETF inflows, and the increase in on-chain supply could signal a bullish setup, despite recent minor price fluctuations.

SOL: 0.0 — The market is mixed with a large whale selling off SOL, counterbalanced by positive regulatory developments in Brazil. No clear directional bias at this time.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price and trading volume surges driven by Elon Musk's influence suggest increased retail interest, providing a short-term bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's issuance indicates potential bullish market flows, the current market environment favors risk assets over stablecoins, suggesting a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-08-21 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows stable conditions with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.27. The crypto market is experiencing a mix of bullish signals, particularly for BTC and ETH, driven by strong technical indicators and positive news such as potential short squeezes and institutional interest. Solana is seeing mixed signals with significant whale activity, while Dogecoin has gained momentum due to social media influence. Tether remains stable but is actively expanding its offerings, indicating potential future capital inflows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by technical indicators and news of potential short squeezes. The limited impact of the Mt. Gox transfer further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest is strong, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows. Technical indicators remain bullish, suggesting potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite some whale selling, regulatory approval for a new ETF in Brazil provides a positive outlook. Technical indicators are mixed but lean slightly bullish.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent social media-driven price increase and heightened trading activity suggest renewed interest, although the long-term impact remains uncertain.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current bullish sentiment in the market, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets. However, Tether's expansion efforts may mitigate some of this outflow."
2024-08-21 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context indicates a stable environment with moderate volatility, as evidenced by the VIX at 16.27. The crypto market shows signs of bullish momentum, particularly for BTC and ETH, supported by strong technical indicators and positive news. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short-squeeze scenario, which could lead to a sharp price increase. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional demand, as highlighted by the success of the ETH ETF. Solana's market activity is mixed, with significant whale selling but also regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest due to social media influence, while Tether continues to expand its market presence with new stablecoin initiatives.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and the potential for a short squeeze suggest a bullish outlook. The limited impact of the Mt. Gox transfer further supports confidence in BTC's upward trajectory.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest, as evidenced by the ETH ETF's success, and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply, indicate a positive outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite significant whale selling, regulatory support in Brazil and stable technical indicators provide a cautiously optimistic view on Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent social media-driven price movements and increased trading activity suggest a short-term positive sentiment, though long-term fundamentals remain unchanged.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the relative attractiveness of holding USDT."
2024-08-22 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Solana is seeing accumulation by large holders, suggesting confidence in its near-term potential, while Dogecoin has experienced a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's social media activity. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, but the current environment favors risk assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with bullish news suggesting potential for a short squeeze.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite bearish pressure from whale sales, technical indicators remain positive, and the overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and positive ecosystem developments like the PYUSD trading support suggest a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's social media activity has improved sentiment, although technical indicators remain stable.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals across risk assets, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-08-22 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation at support levels and positive ecosystem developments suggest potential for price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's activity provides a slight positive sentiment boost, though technicals remain neutral.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish technical indicators across most major cryptocurrencies, despite some recent price declines. Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential short squeeze, with analysts eyeing resistance around $62K, while Ethereum is facing bearish pressure due to whale sales. Solana is seeing accumulation by large holders, suggesting confidence in its price support, and Dogecoin has experienced a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's social media activity. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, indicating a strategic push into new markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a recent price dip, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain bullish, and the potential for a short squeeze could drive prices higher.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from whale sales, and the lack of a clear breakout above $3,050 suggests a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation at key support levels and positive ecosystem developments, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's social media activity provides a slight positive sentiment boost, though technicals remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed market signals and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, maintaining a neutral stance on stablecoin allocation is prudent."
2024-08-22 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze as it approaches resistance around $62K. Despite recent price increases, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, influencing investor behavior. Ethereum faces bearish sentiment due to whale selling pressure, although it remains stable around the $2,600 mark. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whales at the $135 support level, suggesting potential for a breakout. Dogecoin has seen a renewed interest following Elon Musk's AI-themed post, although its technical indicators remain mixed. Tether continues to expand its global stablecoin offerings, which may enhance its appeal as a stable asset in volatile conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum and potential for a short squeeze, supported by positive on-chain activity and bullish news sentiment.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum is facing bearish pressure from whale sales, and technical indicators are mixed, suggesting a cautious approach is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation at key support levels and positive developments in its trading ecosystem suggest potential for upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's post has improved sentiment, but technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a modest positive score.

USDT: -0.4 — With improving sentiment in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with potential upside."
2024-08-22 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near $62K, indicating bullish pressure. Ethereum, however, faces bearish sentiment due to whale sales, despite trading close to $2,600. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whales at the $135 support level, suggesting a potential breakout, while Dogecoin has seen renewed interest due to a social media post by Elon Musk. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a balanced risk environment. Tether's expansion into new stablecoin offerings reflects ongoing innovation in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive momentum and potential for a short squeeze suggest further upside, supported by strong on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.3 — Bearish sentiment from whale sales and lack of significant upward momentum warrant a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem expansion through new trading pairs provide a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from social media activity could drive short-term gains, though technical indicators remain mixed.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital may rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and SOL."
2024-08-22 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward movement, possibly driven by a short squeeze near the $62K resistance level. Despite a recent price increase, the overall macro environment remains cautious, with investors wary of broader economic conditions. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales, and it needs a significant breakout to reverse this trend. Solana is experiencing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential for a price breakout, while Dogecoin has seen renewed interest due to social media influence. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which may bolster its utility and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze and has been experiencing a price increase, suggesting a cautiously optimistic outlook. On-chain activity is also robust.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum faces downward pressure from whale sales, and technical indicators do not show strong bullish momentum. The need for a breakout above $3,050 adds to the cautious sentiment.

SOL: +0.6 — Accumulation by whales and positive developments in its ecosystem, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, suggest a favorable outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest driven by social media influence provides a slight positive sentiment, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in allocation preference, with no significant changes in market conditions warranting a shift in exposure."
2024-08-22 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near $62K, despite a general environment of investor caution. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, keeping it below key resistance levels. Solana is seeing accumulation by large holders, suggesting confidence in a potential breakout. Dogecoin has experienced a sentiment boost following Elon Musk's social media activity, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged token. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, suggest a relatively stable environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze, with consistent buy signals from technical indicators and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a slight price increase, Ethereum faces selling pressure from whales, keeping sentiment mixed and warranting a neutral stance until clearer bullish signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong accumulation by whales and positive ecosystem developments, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, support a bullish outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's social media activity has improved sentiment, but without significant technical or on-chain support, the outlook remains moderately positive.

USDT: -0.2 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of higher-risk assets."
2024-08-22 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near $62K, although broader investor caution persists. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales, keeping it below the $2,600 mark, while Solana benefits from whale accumulation and ecosystem expansion with new trading pairs. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's social media activity, though its technical indicators remain neutral. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, indicating a strategic push into new markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite cautious market sentiment, Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and consistent buy signals from trend indicators suggest a moderate bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.2 — Continued selling pressure from whales and the need to break significant resistance levels keep Ethereum in a slightly bearish position.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong accumulation by whales and positive ecosystem developments support a bullish stance, with technical indicators also showing upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from social media activity provides a slight positive sentiment, but technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the moderately bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets."
2024-08-22 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze as it approaches the $62K resistance level.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with slight upward price movements across most cryptocurrencies, supported by technical indicators and recent news. Bitcoin is showing potential for a short squeeze near $62K, indicating bullish sentiment despite a cautious macro environment. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, although it remains stable just below $2,600. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whales at the $135 support level, suggesting confidence in a potential breakout. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost due to Elon Musk's social media activity, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings, indicating a strategic broadening of its market presence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential short squeeze and has maintained positive momentum, making it attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces selling pressure from whales, leading to a neutral stance as it struggles to break key resistance levels.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem developments like Bitget's PYUSD support suggest a positive outlook for Solana, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's AI-themed post has improved sentiment, providing a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of bullishness, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."
2024-08-22 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near $62K, supported by a recent price increase. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales, although it maintains a stable position just under $2,600. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whales at a key support level, suggesting potential for a breakout. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's activities, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged token. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and a relatively strong S&P 500, indicating a balanced risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with a potential short squeeze and increased on-chain activity, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish momentum signals, ETH faces selling pressure from whales, warranting a cautious approach until it breaks significant resistance levels.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and positive news regarding ecosystem expansion suggest a favorable outlook for Solana, indicating potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's activities provides a slight positive sentiment boost, though no significant technical changes are observed.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-08-22 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and cautious investor sentiment, as indicated by the VIX and recent price movements in major indices like the S&P 500. Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze near $62K, supported by recent bullish price action, though the overall market remains cautious. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, with a need for a breakout above $3,050 to shift sentiment. Solana is seeing accumulation by whales at $135, suggesting potential for a breakout, while Dogecoin has experienced a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent activity. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, indicating a strategic focus on global market integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price rise suggest a positive outlook, despite broader market caution. On-chain activity supports this view.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum faces downward pressure from whale sales, and the need for a breakout above $3,050 keeps sentiment mixed. However, bullish momentum persists in technical indicators.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and potential breakout towards $155 provide a positive outlook, supported by recent technical signals and ecosystem developments.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's activity has boosted sentiment, though technical indicators remain mixed.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased interest in risk assets like BTC and SOL, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-08-22 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze as it approaches resistance near $62K. Despite the recent price rise, the overall macro environment remains uncertain, which may temper bullish enthusiasm. Ethereum is experiencing downward pressure due to whale sales, and it needs to break above $3,050 to reverse the bearish sentiment. Solana is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential for a breakout, while Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by Elon Musk's recent tweet. Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings, which may increase its attractiveness as a safe haven asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest a moderate buy, but caution is warranted due to macro uncertainty.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, whale selling around the $2,600 level and the need to break $3,050 for a reversal suggest a hold position.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and positive developments like the PYUSD trading support indicate a strong buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's tweet provides a slight bullish sentiment, though technicals remain neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With a slight increase in risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, a moderate reduction in USDT is advisable."
2024-08-22 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near the $62K resistance level. Despite recent price increases, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, which is reflected in the cautious market outlook. Ethereum is experiencing downward pressure due to whale sales, and it needs to break the $3,050 level to reverse the bearish sentiment. Solana is seeing accumulation by whales at the $135 support level, indicating potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by Elon Musk's recent AI-themed post, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is showing potential for a short squeeze and has a positive trend signal, suggesting a moderate buy preference as it approaches key resistance levels.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum faces bearish sentiment due to whale sales and needs to break significant resistance to reverse this trend, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and recent developments like the addition of PYUSD trading on Solana support a positive outlook, indicating a preference to increase exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from Elon Musk's post provides a slight boost, but without strong technical signals, a moderate buy preference is appropriate.

USDT: -0.5 — With the potential for bullish moves in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is sensible to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-08-22 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze near the $62K resistance, although the broader macroeconomic environment remains uncertain. Ethereum is facing bearish pressure due to whale sales, while Solana is seeing accumulation at key support levels, indicating potential for a breakout. Dogecoin has experienced a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent activity, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings, which could enhance its utility and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price stability, the potential for a short squeeze and positive sentiment around resistance levels suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Ongoing whale sales and technical resistance at $3,050 indicate bearish sentiment, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation at $135 and ecosystem developments like PYUSD trading support a bullish outlook, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's activity provides a slight positive sentiment boost, but with no strong technical signals, a modest increase is justified.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market conditions and lack of immediate need for stablecoin holdings, maintaining a neutral position is appropriate."
2024-08-22 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze as it hovers near resistance levels. Despite a recent price increase, investor caution persists due to macroeconomic uncertainties. Ethereum is facing bearish sentiment due to whale sales, and it remains under pressure unless it can break above $3,050. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whale wallets, suggesting potential for a breakout, while Dogecoin has seen renewed interest driven by social media activity. Tether continues to expand its global presence with new stablecoin offerings, indicating a stable demand for USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze, the overall cautious market sentiment tempers enthusiasm. A modest increase in allocation is warranted to capture potential upside.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and the need for a significant price breakout to reverse bearish sentiment suggest reducing exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem expansion through new stablecoin support indicate a positive outlook, justifying increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Social media-driven interest provides a slight positive sentiment, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests only a minor increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market presence, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate given the market's cautious tone."
2024-08-22 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate interest rates and stable oil prices, with the U.S. Dollar Index and gold prices indicating a cautious investor sentiment. The S&P 500 is relatively high, but the VIX suggests low volatility, indicating a stable but cautious market environment. Bitcoin shows mixed signals with a potential for a short squeeze, but overall market sentiment remains cautious. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, while Solana sees accumulation by whales at key support levels. Dogecoin sentiment has been slightly boosted by Elon Musk's social media activity, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with new partnerships.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, the potential for a short squeeze and recent price resilience suggest moderate upside potential.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation at support levels and ecosystem developments, like the addition of PYUSD trading, provide a positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Elon Musk's post has revived some interest, the lack of substantial technical or fundamental changes keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious macro environment and mixed signals from other assets, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with cautious optimism. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short squeeze as it approaches resistance near $62K, which could indicate a bullish breakout if sustained. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales, and its price remains stagnant just below $2,600. Solana is seeing accumulation by whales at the $135 support level, suggesting potential for upward movement. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent tweet, although this is more speculative. Tether continues to expand its global stablecoin offerings, enhancing its utility and stability in uncertain markets. Overall, the macroeconomic indicators suggest a stable environment with moderate volatility, which could support a cautious increase in risk exposure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price resilience suggest a moderate bullish outlook, supported by increased on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.1 — Continued whale selling and lack of upward momentum keep Ethereum in a slightly bearish stance, despite stable price levels.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation at key support levels and recent ecosystem developments provide a strong bullish signal for Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from Elon Musk's tweet offers a speculative boost, but fundamentals remain unchanged.

USDT: 0.0 — With a stable macro environment and mixed signals across other assets, maintaining current USDT levels is prudent for liquidity and risk management."
2024-08-22 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze near the $62K resistance level, despite a generally cautious macroeconomic environment. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, needing a breakout above $3,050 to reverse sentiment. Solana shows signs of accumulation by whales at the $135 support, suggesting potential for a breakout, while Dogecoin has seen renewed interest due to Elon Musk's influence. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which could enhance its utility and appeal.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and the need for a significant breakout to reverse sentiment justify a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem developments, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, support a positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's influence provides a slight positive sentiment, but not enough for a strong buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate."
2024-08-22 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and a cautious market outlook, with the S&P 500 showing stability and the U.S. Dollar Index remaining relatively low. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short squeeze, indicating bullish sentiment, while Ethereum faces selling pressure from whales, suggesting a bearish outlook unless it breaks key resistance levels. Solana shows positive accumulation by whales, hinting at potential upward movement, and recent developments in its ecosystem may support this trend. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost due to Elon Musk's influence, but lacks strong technical signals. Tether continues to expand its global presence with new stablecoin offerings, maintaining its role as a stable asset in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest a moderate bullish outlook, supported by strong on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and lack of significant price movement indicate a cautious stance, with potential for further downside unless resistance is broken.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem developments, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, provide a strong bullish signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a sentiment boost from Elon Musk, technical indicators remain neutral, suggesting no immediate change in allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the cautious market environment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent, but the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets reduces its relative attractiveness."
2024-08-22 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued downward pressure from whale sales and the need for a significant price breakout to reverse sentiment justify a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and recent positive developments on the Solana chain suggest a strong buy signal, with potential for a breakout toward $155.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's activity provides a slight positive sentiment boost, but technical indicators remain neutral.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment across cryptocurrencies is mixed, with a cautious outlook prevailing.

Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent social media activity, while Tether is expanding its global stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the cautious macro environment, the potential for a short squeeze and recent price resilience suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued whale selling and the need for a significant price breakout to reverse bearish sentiment indicate a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and positive ecosystem developments, such as new trading pairs, suggest a favorable outlook and a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's social media activity provides a slight positive sentiment boost, warranting a small increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintain a neutral stance as the market does not show a clear shift towards or away from stablecoins at this time."
