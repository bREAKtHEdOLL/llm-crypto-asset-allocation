2024-08-16 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge, indicating a potential reversal from recent lows. However, technical indicators for BTC and other major cryptocurrencies like ETH and SOL remain mixed, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones, suggesting caution. Ethereum's significant drop in gas fees could signal a bullish outlook, but technical patterns warn of potential downside risks. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a relatively stable backdrop for risk assets, but the lack of strong buy signals in technical indicators across assets suggests a need for careful allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of strong technical buy signals, the recent price surge and positive news about price recovery support a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees is historically bullish, but caution is warranted due to technical patterns indicating potential downside risk.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or strong technical signals to justify a change in allocation, maintaining a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintain a neutral position.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to reallocate capital towards these potentially more rewarding assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a recent price surge and Ethereum experiencing historically low gas fees, which could signal potential bullish movements. However, Bitcoin's mining profitability is at an all-time low, which may dampen enthusiasm. Ethereum faces technical risks of a potential correction unless it breaks above key resistance levels. The macroeconomic indicators suggest a stable environment, with moderate volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, which could support risk-on sentiment in the crypto market. USDT continues to show bullish momentum, indicating a preference for liquidity or a hedge against market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price surge and positive sentiment, the low mining profitability warrants a cautious approach. The overall market environment supports a moderate increase in BTC exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees suggests potential for upward movement, but the technical risk of a correction tempers enthusiasm. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: +0.2 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, SOL's recent volume increase suggests some positive momentum, warranting a modest allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive signals in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets while maintaining some liquidity for risk management."
2024-08-16 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge of approximately 5%, suggesting a potential recovery from recent lows. However, Bitcoin's mining profitability remains under pressure due to a rising hashrate. Ethereum's market is showing mixed signals; while gas fees have fallen to 5-year lows, indicating potential bullish momentum, there is a technical warning of a possible correction. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but Solana's technical indicators show bullish momentum. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, which may support risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, the recent price surge and positive news suggest growing investor confidence. The macro environment supports risk assets, making BTC relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees is a positive sign, potentially leading to increased network activity and price appreciation. However, caution is warranted due to the technical warning of a potential correction.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators and stable on-chain activity make SOL an attractive option in the current market, despite the absence of significant news.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. However, the recent surge in transaction activity should be monitored for potential future developments.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment in risk assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets like BTC and ETH, which show signs of recovery."
2024-08-16 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a recent price surge, although its mining profitability remains low. Ethereum is experiencing historically low gas fees, which could signal a bullish outlook, but technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a moderate risk environment, potentially supporting a slight shift towards riskier assets. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could cap upside potential for cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Recent price surge and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook, although mining profitability concerns warrant caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Low gas fees are historically bullish, but technical warnings of a potential correction suggest a balanced approach.

SOL: +0.2 — Bullish momentum signals and stable on-chain activity support a modest positive allocation, despite the lack of significant news.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a slight increase in price and transaction activity, the absence of significant news or technical signals keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-16 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, driven by positive momentum and increased on-chain activity. However, mining profitability concerns could temper enthusiasm. Ethereum shows potential for upward movement with historically low gas fees, but technical patterns suggest possible downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have shown bullish momentum in recent hours, but lack significant news catalysts. USDT remains a stable option, with signals indicating a potential for capital preservation amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Recent price surge and increased on-chain activity suggest a bullish outlook, despite mining profitability concerns. The overall sentiment is positive.

ETH: +0.3 — Low gas fees provide a bullish signal, but caution is warranted due to potential downside risks from technical patterns. The mixed sentiment suggests a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum in recent hours, supported by stable on-chain activity, makes it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains a safe haven, the current market conditions favor a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a recent price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, despite a backdrop of declining mining profitability. Ethereum is seeing historically low gas fees, which could signal a bullish outlook, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana shows consistent bullish momentum in technical indicators. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility in the broader market, which might support a cautious but optimistic approach to risk assets. USDT remains a stable option amidst these conditions, but the preference may shift towards riskier assets if bullish trends continue.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The recent price surge and bullish momentum indicators suggest a positive outlook, but caution is warranted due to low mining profitability.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees is a bullish signal, but technical patterns suggest potential downside risk; hence, a moderate positive allocation is justified.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent bullish momentum in technical indicators, despite the lack of significant news, supports a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.2 — With some positive signals in risk assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-16 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of bullish momentum despite some mixed technical signals. Bitcoin has recently experienced a price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, although mining profitability is at an all-time low. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to five-year lows, often a precursor to upward price movements, but a rising-wedge pattern suggests potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have shown steady price increases, supported by bullish momentum, but lack significant news catalysts. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and moderate interest rates, which may support risk-on sentiment in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite mining profitability concerns, Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong on-chain activity indicate bullish momentum, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical patterns suggest potential downside, the drop in gas fees and recent price increase support a cautiously positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued price increases and bullish momentum without significant news suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite slight price increases and activity surges, the lack of significant news or technical signals keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-16 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a notable price recovery and Ethereum benefiting from decreased gas fees, which historically signal potential bullish movements. Despite the positive momentum in BTC and ETH, technical indicators suggest caution, as BTC's mining profitability is at a historic low and ETH faces potential downside risks from a rising-wedge pattern. Solana and Dogecoin have shown consistent, albeit modest, price increases with no significant news impacting their outlook. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a steady S&P 500, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the mining profitability concern, BTC's recent price surge and on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook. The strong reversal from July lows supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees is a bullish indicator, but the potential technical correction tempers enthusiasm. A cautious buy is warranted given the mixed signals.

SOL: +0.2 — Consistent price increases and positive technical indicators provide a slightly bullish outlook, though the absence of significant news suggests a modest allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in on-chain activity, DOGE remains neutral. The current market conditions do not strongly favor DOGE over other assets.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and ETH."
2024-08-16 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a notable price surge and Ethereum benefiting from historically low gas fees, which often precede price increases. However, Bitcoin's mining profitability is at an all-time low, which could pose a risk if sustained. Ethereum's technical setup suggests potential downside risk unless it breaks a key resistance level. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana shows consistent bullish momentum in technical indicators. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the mining profitability concern, Bitcoin's recent price surge and bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains. The strong reversal from July lows is a positive indicator.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees and bullish momentum are encouraging, but the potential downside risk from the rising-wedge pattern tempers enthusiasm. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.6 — Consistent bullish momentum and positive technical signals, combined with a lack of negative news, make Solana attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment and momentum in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibiting upward momentum and positive price action. Bitcoin has seen a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, although mining profitability concerns persist. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to five-year lows, potentially signaling a bullish outlook, but there are technical warnings of a possible correction. Solana maintains a steady upward trend with consistent on-chain activity, while Dogecoin shows minor price increases without significant news. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, supports a cautiously optimistic outlook for risk assets, suggesting a potential shift from stablecoins like USDT to more volatile cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong price surge and bullish momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity. Despite mining profitability concerns, the overall sentiment is positive.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum with low gas fees, but technical warnings of a potential correction warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.6 — Consistent upward trend and bullish momentum, with no negative news impacting sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Minor price increase and normal activity, but no significant news or signals to drive a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-08-16 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum signals and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, despite challenges in mining profitability. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to five-year lows, which is typically a bullish signal, though there is a technical warning of potential downside risk. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but their technical indicators remain positive. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on environment, suggesting potential capital rotation from stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The recent price surge and bullish momentum, along with increased on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. Despite mining profitability concerns, the overall sentiment is positive.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum shows bullish momentum and low gas fees, the potential downside risk from the rising-wedge pattern tempers enthusiasm. However, the overall outlook remains moderately positive.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, along with stable on-chain activity, make Solana an attractive option in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite positive momentum signals, the lack of significant news and relatively stable price action suggest a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a moderate incentive to rotate capital out of USDT and into more volatile cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-16 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum is also showing bullish signs, with gas fees falling to five-year lows, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have not seen significant news, but both show positive technical indicators. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady S&P 500 index, which may support continued interest in risk assets. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could pose challenges for further upside in crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite mining profitability concerns, Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum. The overall market sentiment is supportive of further gains.

ETH: +0.4 — Ethereum's low gas fees and bullish technical indicators are positive, but caution is warranted due to potential downside risks highlighted by the rising-wedge pattern.

SOL: +0.3 — While there is no significant news, Solana's technical indicators remain bullish, and its recent price movements suggest a stable upward trend.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows bullish momentum, but without significant news or changes in sentiment, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market shows signs of bullishness, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-16 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a mix of bullish signals and potential risks. Bitcoin has shown a strong price recovery, supported by increased on-chain activity, although mining profitability concerns persist. Ethereum's reduced gas fees suggest a bullish outlook, but technical patterns indicate possible downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana's recent price drop and technical signals suggest caution. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and steady indices, which may support risk-on behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong on-chain activity indicate a bullish outlook, despite mining profitability concerns. The overall sentiment is positive, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum's gas fees suggest a bullish outlook, technical patterns indicate potential downside risks. Maintain a moderate positive stance, balancing optimism with caution.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite positive technical signals, recent price declines and lack of significant news suggest a neutral stance. Monitor for further developments.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintain a neutral position on Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, reduce stablecoin holdings to allocate more capital to riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment shows a mix of cautious optimism and potential volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, driven by strong upward momentum and increased on-chain activity, despite the challenges faced by miners. Ethereum's reduced gas fees suggest potential bullish movement, although technical patterns indicate possible downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but both show mixed signals in recent trading data. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, which supports a cautiously optimistic outlook for risk assets. However, the recent fluctuations in crypto prices suggest a need for careful allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with a recent price surge and increased on-chain activity, suggest continued upward potential. The macroeconomic environment is supportive of risk assets, enhancing Bitcoin's attractiveness.

ETH: +0.5 — While Ethereum shows bullish potential due to low gas fees, the technical warning of a potential correction tempers enthusiasm. The overall sentiment remains positive, but caution is advised due to the rising-wedge pattern.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana's recent price increase and stable on-chain activity provide a modestly positive outlook. However, the absence of strong buy signals suggests a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral. The lack of clear direction in both data and sentiment justifies a hold position.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment in risk assets like BTC and ETH, there is a preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of higher potential returns from other cryptocurrencies. The stable macroeconomic environment supports this capital rotation."
2024-08-16 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, which indicates strong upward momentum despite the challenges in mining profitability. Ethereum is experiencing historically low gas fees, which often precedes upward price movements, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have shown some volatility without significant news to drive sentiment. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, which may encourage risk-on behavior in crypto markets. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst these mixed signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and bullish momentum across technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for further gains. Despite mining profitability concerns, the price action is currently dominant.

ETH: +0.5 — While Ethereum's low gas fees are a bullish signal, the potential downside risk flagged by technical patterns tempers enthusiasm. Nonetheless, the overall sentiment remains positive.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana shows no significant news or strong technical signals to warrant a change in allocation. The recent price decrease and lack of bullish momentum suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral. The recent activity surge does not translate into a clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely. The current market sentiment favors allocation towards more volatile assets with potential upside."
2024-08-16 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context presents a relatively stable environment with low volatility (VIX at 14.8) and a moderate U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 102.46). Bitcoin has shown strong upward momentum recently, with a notable price surge and a buy signal from technical indicators, despite low on-chain activity. Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, with a bullish outlook from low gas fees but potential downside risk from a rising-wedge pattern. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news or strong technical signals, with Solana experiencing a potential breakdown below its Bollinger Bands. Tether remains stable, as expected, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum. Despite low on-chain activity, the overall sentiment is positive, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum's gas fees are at a 5-year low, indicating potential bullish momentum, the rising-wedge pattern suggests caution. A moderate increase in allocation is justified by the mixed signals.

SOL: -0.1 — Solana's lack of significant news and potential breakdown below its Bollinger Bands indicate caution. A slight reduction in exposure is prudent given the current technical weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to adjust the current allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive momentum in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-16 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, driven by a recent price surge of approximately 5%. Despite this, Bitcoin mining profitability has hit all-time lows, which could pose long-term sustainability concerns. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to five-year lows, often a precursor to bullish price movements, although there is a potential downside risk flagged by technical patterns. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, supports a balanced risk approach, with potential for increased exposure to riskier assets like BTC and ETH.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and recent price surge signal a positive outlook. Despite mining profitability concerns, the overall sentiment remains bullish, justifying increased exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — The drop in gas fees suggests a bullish outlook, although technical patterns indicate potential downside risk. A moderate increase in allocation is justified given the mixed signals.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, there are no strong technical or news signals to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive signals in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to reallocate capital into more promising assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, breaking out of a recent low and reclaiming higher price levels. Ethereum is also showing positive signs with historically low gas fees, which often precede price increases, although there is some technical caution due to a potential rising-wedge pattern. Solana and Dogecoin have shown some price recovery but lack significant news or strong technical signals. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, which supports a moderate risk-on environment. This suggests a potential shift from stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets as investors seek higher returns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite technical warnings, the drop in gas fees and overall bullish sentiment provide a positive outlook, though with some caution due to potential downside risks.

SOL: +0.2 — While lacking strong buy signals, Solana's slight price recovery and stable on-chain activity suggest a cautious but positive stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, the lack of significant news or strong technical indicators keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — With a bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into higher-risk assets for potential gains."
2024-08-16 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, breaking above key resistance levels and indicating a potential breakout. Ethereum is also displaying bullish signals, supported by historically low gas fees, although some technical patterns suggest caution. Solana and Dogecoin are relatively stable with no significant news or technical indicators suggesting major moves. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady indices, which supports risk-on sentiment. However, the U.S. dollar index remains strong, which could cap some upside potential in the crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band, supported by positive news and on-chain activity. This makes it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, the drop in gas fees and overall bullish sentiment provide a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to potential downside risks highlighted by technical patterns.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana shows no significant technical or news-driven catalysts. The lack of a buy signal and stable price action suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin lacks significant news or technical signals to warrant a change in allocation. The recent price increase is not supported by strong technical indicators.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish sentiment in the market, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT and into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-08-16 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, driven by strong upward momentum and positive technical indicators, despite a challenging environment for miners. Ethereum is also showing bullish momentum with a significant drop in gas fees, which historically precedes upward price movements, although there is a potential technical risk of a correction. Solana and Dogecoin have seen price increases, but lack significant news or strong technical signals to support a robust bullish stance. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a steady S&P 500, which supports a moderate risk-on sentiment. 

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and bullish momentum, along with positive technical indicators, suggest a favorable environment for further gains. The recent price breakout above the Bollinger Bands reinforces this bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is supported by historically low gas fees, indicating potential for further price appreciation. However, the risk of a technical correction tempers the score slightly.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's price has increased, but without significant news or strong technical signals, the score remains moderate. The lack of a buy signal and neutral momentum indicators suggest a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some price increase and activity surge, Dogecoin lacks strong technical or news-driven catalysts to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market sentiment leaning towards bullishness, there is a reduced need to hold stablecoins. Capital rotation into more volatile assets is favored as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-16 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, reclaiming levels near $59,600, despite mining profitability challenges. Ethereum is experiencing a bullish outlook with historically low gas fees, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana's technical indicators are neutral, while Dogecoin shows bullish momentum. The macroeconomic context, with a stable S&P 500 and low volatility index, suggests a moderate risk environment, potentially favoring risk-on assets over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price recovery and bullish momentum, despite mining profitability concerns, indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — While Ethereum faces potential technical correction risks, the significant drop in gas fees and historical patterns suggest a bullish outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest a hold position, with no clear signals for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite no significant news, Dogecoin's bullish momentum and on-chain activity surge warrant a slight positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in BTC and ETH, reducing USDT exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-16 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a slight bullish tilt, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, recovering from recent lows, although mining profitability concerns persist. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to a five-year low, which historically signals potential bullish momentum, though technical patterns suggest caution. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news catalysts, and their technical indicators show no strong bullish signals. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a steady S&P 500, suggesting a balanced risk environment. In such conditions, maintaining a diversified approach with a slight bias towards risk assets over stablecoins seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, despite mining profitability concerns. The overall sentiment is positive, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.4 — Ethereum's low gas fees and bullish historical pattern provide a positive outlook, though caution is advised due to potential technical corrections. A moderate increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana remains a hold. The lack of strong signals suggests maintaining current exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows mixed signals with no significant news or technical changes. Holding the current position is appropriate given the lack of clear direction.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite slightly increases, a modest reduction in USDT holdings is advisable to allocate more capital towards BTC and ETH, which show stronger bullish signals."
2024-08-16 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.8. The U.S. Dollar Index is stable, and gold prices are high, suggesting a cautious but not overly risk-averse market sentiment. Bitcoin has recently experienced a price surge, recovering from earlier lows, but faces challenges with mining profitability. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen significantly, which could signal a bullish outlook, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, while Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, despite concerns about mining profitability. The overall bullish sentiment supports a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum shows bullish potential with low gas fees, the risk of a technical correction tempers enthusiasm. A moderate positive score reflects the mixed signals.

SOL: -0.1 — Lack of significant news and weak technical indicators suggest a cautious stance. The absence of bullish momentum warrants a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral. The low on-chain activity does not justify increased allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment in BTC and ETH, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets, reflecting increased risk appetite."
2024-08-17 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price movements. Ethereum, while experiencing a rally, faces resistance around $2,700, and the underperformance of Ether ETFs has dampened enthusiasm. Solana's prospects are clouded by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, which may hinder short-term growth. Dogecoin is experiencing increased whale accumulation and has broken through a local resistance, indicating potential for further gains. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a relatively stable environment for risk assets, though caution is warranted given the mixed signals across different cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with potential for a Q4 rally as suggested by historical patterns.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's overall technical indicators remain positive, though tempered by the underperformance of ETFs.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty regarding ETF approvals and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough above resistance levels indicate potential for further price appreciation.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive signals in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in risk assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment shows a mixed but cautiously optimistic outlook. Bitcoin is displaying strong upward momentum with positive technical indicators and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and macroeconomic factors such as the U.S. presidential election cycle. Ethereum, while showing some bullish momentum, faces resistance around $2,700 and lacks the enthusiasm expected from recent ETF launches. Solana is experiencing uncertainty due to the removal of ETF filings, which may dampen investor sentiment. Dogecoin is seeing positive accumulation trends and breaking through resistance levels, suggesting potential for further gains. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and historical patterns suggest a potential rally. Positive news and on-chain activity support an increased allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical indicators justify a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Uncertainty from ETF filing removals offsets any potential bullish sentiment, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and recent resistance breakthrough indicate potential for further gains, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-17 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally pattern post-halving and maintaining a position near $59k, despite election-year volatility. Ethereum has been facing resistance around $2,700, with underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs dampening enthusiasm. Solana faces uncertainty due to the removal of ETF filings, which could delay U.S. approval. Dogecoin is seeing positive momentum with increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance, suggesting potential for further gains. In this context, USDT remains stable with no significant news, often serving as a safe haven during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The potential for a Q4 rally and strong on-chain activity support a positive outlook, despite election-year volatility.

ETH: 0.0 — Resistance at $2,700 and underperforming ETFs suggest a neutral stance, with no clear bullish signals.

SOL: -0.2 — The removal of ETF filings introduces uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach given current holdings.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a technical breakout above resistance indicate a favorable short-term outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish trends in BTC and DOGE, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is warranted to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-08-17 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price movements. However, the broader macroeconomic environment, including stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggests a mixed backdrop for risk assets. Ethereum faces resistance and underwhelming ETF performance, which could dampen enthusiasm. Solana's market sentiment is impacted by regulatory setbacks, while Dogecoin benefits from increased whale accumulation and technical breakouts. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid potential volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential Q4 rally and strong on-chain activity suggest a favorable outlook, supported by historical trends and current technical signals.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces resistance and disappointing ETF performance, leading to a neutral stance as it struggles to break key levels.

SOL: -0.2 — Regulatory uncertainty and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased whale accumulation and technical breakouts above resistance levels provide a positive outlook, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-08-17 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. dollar index remains strong, which could cap significant upward movements in risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and on-chain activity. Ethereum faces resistance around $2,700 and mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's potential is dampened by regulatory delays in ETF approvals. Dogecoin exhibits bullish signals with increased whale accumulation and recent resistance breakthroughs. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with positive historical patterns suggesting a potential Q4 rally.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces significant resistance and mixed sentiment from underperforming ETFs, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainties regarding ETF approvals and lack of strong buy signals suggest a cautious approach, though not enough to warrant a sell given current holdings.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive momentum and whale accumulation indicate potential for further gains, making it an attractive option for increased allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets is advisable."

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical post-halving patterns and election-year volatility. Ethereum, however, faces resistance around $2,700, with underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs dampening enthusiasm. Solana's prospects are clouded by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin benefits from increased whale accumulation and a recent technical breakout. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in traditional markets, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin exhibits strong technical signals and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and positive sentiment from recent news.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces resistance and mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainty from ETF filing removals introduces potential headwinds, offsetting bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a technical breakout above resistance suggest potential for further gains, making it relatively attractive.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive signals in risk assets like BTC and DOGE, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2024-08-17 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally following historical patterns post-halving and election-year volatility. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, with underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs dampening enthusiasm. Solana's market sentiment is impacted by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin benefits from significant whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance, suggesting potential for further gains. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and a steady S&P 500, which may support a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin exhibits strong bullish momentum and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and current technical indicators.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces resistance and mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.1 — Regulatory delays in ETF approvals introduce uncertainty, and technical indicators do not provide a strong buy signal, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant whale accumulation and a technical breakout above resistance indicate potential for further price appreciation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally positive market sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-08-17 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin is exhibiting strong technical indicators and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price movements. Ethereum, while showing bullish momentum, faces resistance around $2,700 and underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs, which tempers enthusiasm. Solana is experiencing uncertainty due to the removal of ETF filings, which could affect its short-term outlook. Dogecoin is seeing positive sentiment with increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above a key resistance level, suggesting potential for further gains. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, indicates a moderate risk environment, which may support a shift towards riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and historical patterns suggest potential for a Q4 rally, making it a preferred asset in the current environment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, resistance at $2,700 and disappointing ETF performance create a neutral outlook.

SOL: -0.1 — Uncertainty from the removal of ETF filings dampens short-term prospects, though momentum remains positive.

DOGE: +0.6 — Increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above resistance indicate potential for further gains, warranting increased allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-17 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-08-17 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential rally patterns reminiscent of past halving-year trends, suggesting a possible bullish Q4. However, the market is also experiencing choppy movements, likely influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the upcoming U.S. presidential elections. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with recent ETF launches underperforming expectations, which may dampen enthusiasm. Solana is experiencing uncertainty due to the removal of ETF filings, while Dogecoin is seeing positive sentiment from increased whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough above resistance levels. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable indicators, supports a balanced approach, with a slight tilt towards risk assets given the potential for a Bitcoin rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential Q4 rally pattern and strong technical signals suggest a bullish outlook, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces resistance and underwhelming ETF performance, suggesting a hold position.

SOL: -0.2 — Uncertainty from ETF filing removals and lack of strong buy signals suggest a cautious reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from whale accumulation and technical breakthroughs support a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With a potential Bitcoin rally and increased risk appetite, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential rally patterns post-halving and aligning with historical election-year volatility. Ethereum, while experiencing a recent rally, faces resistance at $2,700 and underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs, suggesting mixed sentiment. Solana's market outlook is dampened by the removal of ETF filings, introducing regulatory uncertainty. Dogecoin is experiencing positive momentum with increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance, indicating potential for further gains. In the macroeconomic context, stable indicators like the S&P 500 and low volatility (VIX) suggest a stable environment, but the relatively high U.S. dollar index may cap upside potential for crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin's potential Q4 rally pattern and historical election-year trends suggest a favorable outlook. On-chain activity is also supportive.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and on-chain activity remains stable. However, ETF underperformance tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty due to ETF filing withdrawals offsets bullish momentum signals, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from whale accumulation and technical breakthroughs suggest potential for further price appreciation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-17 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns related to halving years and election cycles. Ethereum, while showing bullish momentum, faces resistance around $2,700 and underperformance of Ether ETFs, which could temper enthusiasm. Solana faces uncertainty due to the removal of ETF filings, which may delay U.S. approval and impact investor sentiment. Dogecoin shows bullish potential with increased whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough above resistance levels. Meanwhile, macroeconomic indicators such as stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility suggest a relatively stable environment, though the S&P 500's high level indicates potential for broader market corrections.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong historical patterns suggest potential for a Q4 rally, supported by bullish momentum and on-chain activity. The positive sentiment around election-year cycles further strengthens the case for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance and underperforming ETFs, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and on-chain activity, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: -0.1 — The removal of ETF filings introduces uncertainty, and while momentum is positive, the lack of a buy signal from trend indicators suggests caution.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above resistance levels indicate potential for further price gains, supporting a positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally optimistic market outlook and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-08-17 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a potential for a Q4 rally in Bitcoin, as indicated by historical post-halving trends and election-year volatility patterns. Ethereum faces resistance near $2,700, with recent ETF disappointments weighing on sentiment. Solana's outlook is clouded by regulatory uncertainties following the removal of ETF filings. Dogecoin is experiencing increased whale accumulation, suggesting potential for price appreciation. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and no significant shifts in major indices or commodities, which supports a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive historical patterns and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for a Q4 rally, supporting a moderately bullish stance.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $2,700, bullish momentum and technical indicators warrant a slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty and lack of a clear buy signal suggest a neutral stance, awaiting further developments.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and recent technical breakout above resistance provide a positive outlook, justifying increased exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to increase exposure to other assets."
2024-08-17 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally post-halving and aligning with historical election-year volatility patterns. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, and its ETF performance has been underwhelming, which may dampen enthusiasm. Solana's ETF prospects are uncertain due to regulatory delays, while Dogecoin is experiencing positive momentum from whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in traditional markets, suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a Q4 rally and historical patterns suggest a positive outlook, supported by strong on-chain activity. However, the lack of a bullish momentum signal tempers enthusiasm slightly.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum in technical indicators. The underperformance of ETFs is a concern, but overall sentiment remains cautiously positive.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's technical indicators are mixed, with bullish momentum but no buy signal from trend analysis. Regulatory uncertainty around ETFs adds to the neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's breakout above resistance and increased whale accumulation suggest a favorable short-term outlook, supported by bullish momentum signals.

USDT: -0.4 — In a moderately bullish environment, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of potential upward momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing choppy movements due to macroeconomic factors like the U.S. presidential election cycle and historical post-halving trends, suggesting a possible Q4 rally. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's outlook is clouded by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin is seeing positive sentiment driven by whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance levels. The macroeconomic context, including stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a stable environment for risk assets, with potential for growth in the crypto space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite choppy movements, historical patterns and potential Q4 rally suggest a moderate buy signal. On-chain activity remains stable, supporting a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity provide a slight positive bias. However, ETF underperformance tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.1 — Recent price increases and bullish momentum are offset by regulatory uncertainties regarding ETF approvals, leading to a cautious positive stance.

DOGE: +0.6 — Strong buy signal due to whale accumulation and recent breakout above resistance, indicating potential for further price appreciation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and potential for growth in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on market opportunities."
2024-08-17 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets displaying bullish technical indicators and positive news developments. Bitcoin is showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and on-chain activity, though it faces volatility linked to macroeconomic factors like the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum is experiencing resistance around $2,700, with mixed news on ETF performance impacting sentiment. Solana's market outlook is clouded by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin benefits from significant whale accumulation and a recent technical breakout. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced risk environment, favoring a slight shift towards riskier assets while maintaining some stablecoin exposure for safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a Q4 rally and strong on-chain activity support a positive outlook, though macroeconomic volatility warrants cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum's bullish momentum and recent price rally suggest modest upside potential, tempered by ETF-related sentiment.

SOL: +0.1 — While Solana faces regulatory uncertainty, its bullish momentum and recent price increases justify a slight positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant whale accumulation and a technical breakout above resistance indicate strong upward potential, making it an attractive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-17 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. dollar and moderate volatility, which generally supports risk assets. Bitcoin is showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price movements. Ethereum has seen a rally but faces resistance around $2,700, with mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by the withdrawal of ETF filings, introducing uncertainty. Dogecoin is experiencing positive momentum, supported by whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance. Tether remains stable with no significant news, acting as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive historical patterns and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by technical indicators, suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $2,700, bullish momentum and recent price increases justify a moderate positive score.

SOL: 0.0 — Uncertainty due to ETF filing withdrawals offsets the positive technical indicators, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Strong momentum and whale accumulation indicate potential for further gains, supporting a positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-08-17 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing potential upward momentum, bolstered by historical patterns suggesting a Q4 rally, although it faces volatility linked to macroeconomic events like the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum has shown resilience but faces resistance around $2,700, compounded by underwhelming performance of Ether-backed ETFs. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by regulatory hurdles with ETF filings, while Dogecoin is buoyed by increased whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough above resistance levels. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a Q4 rally and historical election-year patterns suggest a bullish outlook. Positive trend signals and on-chain activity support this sentiment.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and trend signals. However, the underperformance of Ether ETFs tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: +0.1 — While Solana shows strong technical signals, regulatory uncertainty regarding ETF filings introduces caution, limiting the score to a modest positive.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a recent technical breakout above resistance indicate strong upward potential, warranting a favorable allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals across other assets and a generally optimistic market sentiment, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a rotation into higher-risk assets."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing potential for upward movement. Bitcoin is experiencing some volatility, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. election cycles and historical halving patterns, suggesting a possible rally in Q4. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with mixed sentiment due to underperforming Ether ETFs. Solana's market is slightly uncertain due to the removal of ETF filings, while Dogecoin is seeing positive momentum from increased whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough above resistance levels. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its continued role as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, historical patterns and potential Q4 rally provide a positive outlook. Increased on-chain activity supports this sentiment.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, the overall bullish momentum and activity surge suggest a cautious buy, though tempered by ETF disappointment.

SOL: 0.0 — Uncertainty from ETF filing removal balances out the positive technical indicators, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.6 — Strong whale accumulation and recent resistance breakthrough indicate potential for further gains, warranting increased allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT is justified to capitalize on potential upward movements in the market."
2024-08-17 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators and positive momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential rally pattern post-halving, with analysts suggesting a possible Q4 rally, although it is also facing volatility linked to the U.S. presidential election cycle. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, and its ETFs are underperforming, which could dampen enthusiasm. Solana's ETF filings have been removed, introducing uncertainty, but the asset maintains bullish technical indicators. Dogecoin shows signs of potential growth due to increased whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough above resistance levels. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by positive news. However, election-related volatility warrants some caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance and underperforming ETFs, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum. The score reflects cautious optimism given the mixed news.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's technical indicators are strong, but uncertainty around ETF filings tempers enthusiasm. The asset remains attractive due to its bullish momentum.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's whale accumulation and recent resistance breakthrough suggest potential for further gains, making it relatively attractive in the current market.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of bullishness, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets."
2024-08-17 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing potential rally patterns post-halving, and its price movements are influenced by macroeconomic factors like the U.S. presidential election cycle. Ethereum (ETH) is facing resistance around $2,700, with mixed news regarding its ETFs. Solana (SOL) is dealing with regulatory uncertainties due to ETF filing removals, while Dogecoin (DOGE) shows positive momentum with increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above local resistance. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a moderate risk environment, which could support a gradual shift from stablecoins like USDT to more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite some choppy movements, BTC shows strong upward potential with positive historical patterns and bullish technical indicators, suggesting a favorable environment for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — While ETH faces resistance, its overall bullish momentum and technical indicators warrant a modest positive allocation, although caution is advised due to ETF underperformance.

SOL: +0.1 — Regulatory uncertainties weigh on SOL, but strong on-chain activity and bullish technical signals support a slight positive bias.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a technical breakout above resistance levels indicate a strong potential for further gains, making DOGE an attractive option for increased exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally positive market sentiment and technical indicators favoring risk assets, a reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-17 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators and on-chain activity. Bitcoin is experiencing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price movements, although it faces volatility linked to macroeconomic events like the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum is struggling to break through short-term resistance levels, with mixed sentiment due to underperforming Ether ETFs. Solana faces uncertainty due to the removal of ETF filings, which could dampen investor enthusiasm. Dogecoin has seen significant whale accumulation, suggesting reduced sell pressure and potential for price appreciation. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite some volatility, Bitcoin's potential Q4 rally and historical patterns suggest a positive outlook. On-chain activity is robust, supporting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum shows bullish momentum, but resistance near $2,700 and underperforming ETFs warrant a cautious approach. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: 0.0 — While technical indicators are positive, the removal of ETF filings introduces uncertainty. Maintain current exposure until more clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and a breakthrough above resistance levels indicate potential for further gains. A modest increase in allocation is recommended.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive signals in other assets, reducing USDT exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-17 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. dollar and low volatility, which may provide a supportive backdrop for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is showing potential for a Q4 rally, backed by historical patterns and recent activity, although it faces short-term volatility linked to macro events like the U.S. presidential election cycle. Ethereum is struggling to maintain momentum above key resistance levels, with recent ETF disappointments weighing on sentiment. Solana faces uncertainty due to ETF filing withdrawals, while Dogecoin is seeing increased whale accumulation, suggesting potential upward price movement. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid mixed signals in the broader market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite short-term volatility, historical patterns suggest potential for a Q4 rally. On-chain activity is strong, supporting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with resistance at $2,700 and disappointing ETF performance. Hold current position as momentum is uncertain.

SOL: -0.1 — ETF filing withdrawals introduce uncertainty, but bullish momentum in technicals suggests maintaining a slight hold with caution.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased whale accumulation and recent resistance breakthrough indicate potential for further gains. Moderate buy signal warranted.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential rallies in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on risk-on sentiment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.75. The crypto market is showing mixed signals, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing slight upward price movements but facing resistance at key levels. Bitcoin's potential Q4 rally is supported by historical patterns, while Ethereum is struggling with resistance and underperforming ETF launches. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by the removal of ETF filings, creating uncertainty. Dogecoin shows positive momentum with increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance, suggesting potential for further gains. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price stability. The macro environment and on-chain activity are stable, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity. The underperformance of ETFs is a concern, but overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's positive on-chain activity is offset by uncertainty from the removal of ETF filings, leading to a neutral stance as market sentiment is unclear.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's breakthrough above resistance and significant whale accumulation suggest strong upward potential, warranting an increased allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive signals in other assets, there is a slight rotation out of USDT to capitalize on potential gains, while maintaining some stability in the portfolio."
2024-08-18 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing increased on-chain activity and a potential breakout, although its dominance is expected to be capped around 60%. Ethereum faces mixed signals, with whale sell-offs indicating short-term risks despite ETF optimism. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space, but an impending token unlock could pressure prices. Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential breakout with a significant increase in active addresses. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's price is showing signs of a breakout, supported by increased on-chain activity. Although dominance is capped, the current momentum is positive.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite whale sell-offs, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity, suggesting a cautious hold with slight upward bias.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's strong DEX activity and price breakout signal positive momentum, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk, warranting a moderate score.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses and slight price increase suggest potential for further gains, supporting a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — With increasing risk appetite across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-18 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 performance. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows consistent buy signals in trend indicators but lacks momentum, while Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to whale sell-offs despite bullish technical indicators. Solana is experiencing high activity and potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks, while Dogecoin's increase in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally. USDT remains stable without significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals in trend indicators and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook, though momentum remains weak.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technicals, recent whale sell-offs introduce uncertainty, balancing the score to neutral.

SOL: +0.3 — High DEX activity and positive technical indicators are offset by potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses and potential for a breakout provide a slightly positive outlook, though recent price decreases warrant caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With overall positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-18 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with significant upward price movements in major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past hour. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with a possible breakout, supported by increased on-chain activity, although its dominance is predicted to be capped at around 60%. Ethereum's price increase is tempered by large whale sell-offs, indicating potential short-term volatility. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space, but the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure on its price. Dogecoin is experiencing a notable increase in active addresses, suggesting potential for further price rallies. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, indicating a reduced risk appetite for stablecoins in the current environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong price increase and breakout potential, supported by high on-chain activity. Despite dominance concerns, current momentum is favorable.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive price momentum and technical indicators, but tempered by whale sell-offs, suggesting caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DEX volume and price momentum, though mindful of potential selling pressure from upcoming token unlocks.

DOGE: +0.4 — Increased active addresses and recent price uptick suggest potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.5 — With rising risk appetite, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish signals and some cautionary news. Bitcoin shows a strong technical setup with buy signals from trend indicators, though its dominance is expected to remain capped. Ethereum faces mixed signals with significant whale sell-offs despite bullish technical indicators, suggesting some short-term risk. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin shows signs of increased activity, which could precede a price rally. USDT remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven in the current market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and on-chain activity suggest upward momentum, although the dominance cap may limit upside potential.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite whale sell-offs, bullish technical indicators and ETF optimism provide a cautiously positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX volume share and bullish technicals are positive, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses and slight price uptick suggest potential for a breakout, though not yet confirmed.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish market sentiment, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is expected as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-18 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and relatively low volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a neutral risk sentiment. Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibit mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing strong on-chain activity but lacking bullish momentum, while Ethereum faces sell pressure from large holders despite bullish technicals. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes, but the upcoming token unlock could apply downward pressure. Dogecoin's increase in active addresses hints at potential positive price movement. Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite mixed momentum signals, Bitcoin's strong on-chain activity and stable macro environment support a modest positive outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — The sell-off by large holders and mixed technical signals suggest caution, though long-term prospects remain positive.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana shows strong DEX activity, the upcoming token unlock poses a risk, warranting a cautious but positive stance.

DOGE: +0.1 — The increase in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally, but current signals are not strong enough for a higher score.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant changes in market sentiment, maintaining a neutral position on Tether is prudent as it serves as a hedge against volatility."
2024-08-18 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing a significant price increase and positive technical indicators, although its dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to large sell-offs by whales, despite some optimism around potential ETF developments. Solana shows strong on-chain activity and decentralized exchange volume, although the upcoming token unlock could apply downward pressure. Dogecoin is seeing increased activity, which could signal a potential breakout. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, suggesting a typical role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive technical indicators suggest continued bullishness, supported by stable macroeconomic conditions.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risk, despite some underlying bullish sentiment from ETF optimism.

SOL: +0.5 — High DEX volume and positive technical indicators are encouraging, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased active addresses and potential for a breakout warrant a positive outlook, though the technicals are not yet fully supportive.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on risk-on sentiment."
2024-08-18 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable outlook with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.7. The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of cautious optimism, with most assets maintaining buy signals from short-term moving averages, although momentum indicators remain mixed. Bitcoin is experiencing increased on-chain activity, but its market dominance is expected to be capped, suggesting limited upside. Ethereum faces short-term risks from large sell-offs by whales, despite positive ETF sentiment. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin shows increased activity, hinting at potential price rallies, while Tether remains stable without significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the capped market dominance, Bitcoin's increased on-chain activity and stable price trends suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.1 — The recent sell-off by whales introduces short-term risk, outweighing the positive ETF sentiment, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX volume share supports a positive outlook, but the upcoming token unlock poses potential price pressure, warranting a cautious buy signal.

DOGE: +0.1 — The surge in active addresses indicates potential for a price rally, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally optimistic market sentiment and potential capital rotation towards riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is advisable."
2024-08-18 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with slight upward movements in prices for most cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin maintains a stable trend with no significant bullish momentum, while Ethereum faces mixed signals due to recent whale sell-offs despite ETF optimism. Solana shows strong on-chain activity and DEX volume, although the upcoming token unlock could introduce selling pressure. Dogecoin's increase in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally, while Tether remains stable with no significant news. The macroeconomic context, with relatively low volatility and stable indices, supports a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a lack of strong momentum signals, Bitcoin's stable price and market cap suggest a modest positive outlook, supported by a stable macroeconomic environment.

ETH: -0.1 — The recent whale sell-off introduces short-term risk, counterbalancing the potential positive impact of ETF optimism, leading to a slightly cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong on-chain activity and DEX volume are positive, but the upcoming token unlock requires careful monitoring. The current momentum justifies a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses indicates potential for price movement, warranting a slight increase in allocation despite low on-chain activity.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant changes or news, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent, allowing flexibility to respond to market shifts."
2024-08-18 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally positive sentiment with several cryptocurrencies experiencing upward momentum. Bitcoin is displaying strong on-chain activity and price increases, though its market dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum has seen significant price increases, but recent whale sell-offs introduce some caution. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes, though a large token unlock could exert downward pressure. Dogecoin's increase in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally, while Tether remains stable with no significant news. Overall, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a moderate risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both price momentum and on-chain activity, coupled with a stable macro environment, make BTC attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent sell-offs by whales, the price breakout and ETF optimism provide a cautiously positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — High DEX activity and price momentum are positive, but the upcoming token unlock warrants some caution.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of bullishness, it's prudent to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-08-18 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of upward momentum. Bitcoin maintains a strong buy signal supported by positive price trends and increased on-chain activity, although its dominance is expected to remain capped. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs despite positive technical indicators. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum with strong DEX activity, but upcoming token unlocks could introduce price pressure.

In this environment, USDT remains a stable option, but with a potential decrease in demand as investors seek higher returns from riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and increased on-chain activity support a bullish outlook. However, dominance concerns cap the score slightly.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite whale sell-offs, technical indicators are positive, and ETF optimism provides a supportive backdrop.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and significant DEX activity are positive, but caution is warranted due to the upcoming token unlock.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a price rally, although technical indicators remain mixed.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher return potential."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum and technical indicators. Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing strong upward momentum with increased on-chain activity, though its dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum (ETH) has seen significant sell-offs by whales, which raises short-term risk concerns despite positive price movements. Solana (SOL) is gaining traction with a significant share of DEX volumes, although a large token unlock could pressure prices. Dogecoin (DOGE) shows signs of a potential breakout with increased active addresses. Tether (USDT) remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with a bullish market sentiment, make BTC attractive despite dominance concerns.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risks, though bullish technicals and ETF optimism provide some support.

SOL: +0.5 — High DEX volume share and bullish momentum are positive, but the upcoming token unlock introduces potential downside risk.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased active addresses and bullish momentum suggest potential for a breakout, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals across several cryptocurrencies, a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is justified to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-18 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators and positive on-chain activity. Bitcoin maintains strong upward momentum, supported by bullish trend and momentum signals, although its market dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs despite positive technical indicators and ETF optimism. Solana is experiencing strong decentralized exchange activity but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin shows signs of a potential breakout with increased active addresses and bullish momentum. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and on-chain activity support further gains. Market dominance concerns are noted but do not outweigh current positive signals.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite whale sell-offs, technical indicators remain bullish, and ETF optimism provides a supportive backdrop.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive DEX activity is encouraging, but caution is warranted due to the upcoming token unlock, which could pressure prices.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased active addresses and bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains, indicating a favorable risk-reward scenario.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2024-08-18 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators and positive momentum. Bitcoin maintains strong on-chain activity, though its market dominance is expected to face resistance around 60%. Ethereum's price is buoyed by ETF optimism, despite recent whale sell-offs, indicating mixed sentiment. Solana is experiencing significant activity in the decentralized exchange space, though upcoming token unlocks could apply downward pressure. Dogecoin is seeing a notable increase in active addresses, suggesting potential for a price rally. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals and bullish momentum, supported by high on-chain activity, though dominance concerns temper enthusiasm slightly.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent whale sell-offs, ETF optimism and bullish technical indicators suggest moderate upside potential.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive DEX activity and technical indicators, but upcoming token unlocks warrant caution.

DOGE: +0.5 — Surge in active addresses and bullish momentum indicate potential for a price rally.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-08-18 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability, with the S&P 500 at a high level and low volatility as indicated by the VIX. In the crypto market, Bitcoin and Ethereum display bullish momentum with positive technical indicators, though Ethereum faces some selling pressure from large holders. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes but faces potential price pressure due to an upcoming token unlock. Dogecoin shows signs of increased activity, which could be a precursor to a price rally. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators and on-chain activity, suggesting continued bullish momentum. However, potential dominance ceiling limits the score.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite bullish technicals, recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risk, balancing the optimism from potential ETF developments.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive DEX activity supports Solana's outlook, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk that tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.4 — Increased active addresses and bullish momentum suggest potential for a breakout, warranting a positive score.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators such as upward momentum and buy signals from moving averages. Bitcoin remains strong, although its dominance is not expected to reach previous highs. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs despite ETF optimism. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space, though upcoming token unlocks may exert downward pressure. Dogecoin shows potential for a breakout with a significant increase in active addresses. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, supports a moderate risk-on sentiment, although the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could cap gains.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, but limited by macroeconomic factors and capped dominance expectations.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale sell-offs countering technical buy signals; cautious approach warranted.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX activity supports bullish sentiment, but potential sell pressure from upcoming token unlocks tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increase in active addresses suggests potential for a breakout, though current price movement remains modest.

USDT: -0.3 — Favorable market conditions and positive sentiment in other assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-18 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and low volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of bullish momentum, with most assets maintaining positive technical indicators such as short-term moving averages above long-term ones and MACD signals indicating bullish momentum. However, there are mixed signals from the news, particularly for Ethereum, where large holders have recently sold off significant amounts, and Solana, which faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin shows increased activity, which could signal a potential breakout, while Tether remains stable without significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin maintains strong technical indicators and normal on-chain activity, but its dominance is expected to be capped, suggesting moderate confidence in further capital allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite positive technicals, the recent sell-off by large holders introduces short-term risk, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX volume supports Solana's attractiveness, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk, leading to a balanced score.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a breakout, but the overall market conditions and technicals remain stable, justifying a modest positive score.

USDT: 0.0 — With stable market conditions and no significant news, maintaining current USDT holdings is prudent as a hedge against potential volatility."
2024-08-18 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators despite recent volatility. Bitcoin maintains a positive trend with strong technical signals, though its market dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs, which could indicate short-term risk despite ETF optimism. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space, but the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure on its price. Dogecoin shows potential for a breakout with a surge in active addresses, while Tether remains stable without significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight recent price decrease, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain positive, and its market dominance remains strong. However, the cap on dominance suggests a moderate rather than aggressive allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technicals are bullish, but the recent whale sell-off introduces uncertainty. The mixed sentiment warrants a neutral stance until further clarity emerges.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's strong DEX activity is a positive sign, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk. A cautious increase in allocation is justified by current market activity.

DOGE: +0.2 — The increase in active addresses suggests potential upward momentum, though recent price decreases advise a conservative approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other cryptocurrencies and no significant news for Tether, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-18 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing buy signals based on short-term moving averages. However, the macroeconomic context remains mixed, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates. Bitcoin's dominance is expected to face resistance, while Ethereum faces short-term sell pressure from large holders despite positive ETF sentiment. Solana's strong presence in decentralized exchange volumes is counterbalanced by an upcoming token unlock that could pressure prices. Dogecoin shows potential for a breakout with increased active addresses, while USDT remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a lack of bullish momentum, Bitcoin's consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity suggest a moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

ETH: 0.0 — The recent sell-off by large holders introduces uncertainty, offsetting the bullish momentum from technical indicators. A neutral stance is prudent.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX volume presence supports a positive outlook, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses indicates potential for upward movement, justifying a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally positive sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital into riskier assets is advisable."
2024-08-18 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing slight upward price movements and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin's dominance is expected to remain capped, which may limit its price growth potential. Ethereum is experiencing mixed signals, with significant whale sell-offs despite some bullish sentiment from potential ETF developments. Solana is showing strength in decentralized exchange volumes but faces potential downward pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin is seeing increased activity, which could signal a potential breakout. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and no significant changes in key indicators, supporting a balanced approach to risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite limited dominance growth, BTC maintains a positive trend signal and stable on-chain activity, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — The recent whale sell-off introduces short-term risk, counterbalancing the bullish ETF sentiment, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX volume share is promising, but the upcoming token unlocks pose a potential risk, suggesting a cautious buy.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses hint at potential upward movement, but lack of strong momentum signals a conservative buy.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable to capture potential gains."
2024-08-18 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most assets showing positive technical signals despite recent minor price declines. Bitcoin's market dominance remains a topic of debate, with analysts predicting a cap around 60%. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs, although optimism around potential ETFs persists. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space, but an upcoming token unlock could apply downward pressure. Dogecoin shows potential for a breakout, as indicated by a surge in active addresses. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price decline, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain generally positive, and its market dominance discussion suggests potential for growth.

ETH: 0.0 — The recent whale sell-off introduces uncertainty, balancing out the bullish ETF sentiment, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX activity supports a positive outlook, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk, warranting a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.1 — The increase in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally, though current technical indicators remain weak.

USDT: -0.2 — With a generally positive market sentiment, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-18 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of positive and negative signals. Bitcoin shows stable price behavior but lacks strong momentum, with dominance expectations capped at around 60%. Ethereum faces short-term selling pressure from whales, though optimism remains due to potential ETF developments. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space but faces potential price pressure from an upcoming token unlock. Dogecoin shows a notable increase in active addresses, hinting at potential upward movement. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite lacking strong momentum, Bitcoin's stable price and market dominance expectations provide a moderate buy signal, especially as a hedge against volatility.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from whale sell-offs and ETF optimism suggest a neutral stance, with no clear direction for immediate allocation changes.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive DEX volume share supports a slight increase in allocation, but caution is warranted due to the upcoming token unlock.

DOGE: +0.1 — The surge in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally, warranting a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential market opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is experiencing a significant price drop, breaking below its lower Bollinger Band, which suggests potential further downside. Ethereum faces short-term risks due to large whale sell-offs, despite ongoing optimism about ETF developments. Solana shows strong decentralized exchange activity, but upcoming token unlocks could exert downward pressure on its price. Dogecoin has seen a notable increase in active addresses, suggesting potential for a price rally, although its technical indicators remain weak. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option for capital preservation amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price breakdown and lack of bullish signals suggest caution, especially with skepticism about regaining market dominance.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale sell-offs countering ETF optimism; technical indicators do not strongly support a buy or sell stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX activity is a positive sign, but potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks warrants a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increase in active addresses hints at potential price rally, but technical indicators remain weak, justifying a modest positive stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the overall market volatility and bearish signals in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-08-19 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is facing pressure from potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could boost optimism but hasn't yet translated into strong bullish momentum. Ethereum is experiencing significant ETF outflows, indicating waning institutional interest, while Solana is seeing record outflows from investment products, though its DeFi use cases are expanding. Dogecoin shows increased network activity despite price stagnation, suggesting underlying community engagement. Tether remains stable, with new blockchain integrations and strong DeFi revenue, indicating its continued utility in the crypto ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite potential positive news from Fed rate cut expectations, technical indicators and on-chain activity remain weak, suggesting a cautious stance.

ETH: -0.5 — Significant ETF outflows and lack of bullish momentum signal a need to reduce exposure amid weakening institutional demand.

SOL: -0.2 — Record outflows and lack of momentum overshadow positive DeFi developments, warranting a slight reduction in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased active addresses indicate strong engagement, but price and technical indicators remain weak, suggesting a hold.

USDT: +0.5 — In a cautious market environment, maintaining or increasing stablecoin exposure is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2024-08-19 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could benefit risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows resilience with a significant portion of its supply held dormant, indicating strong investor confidence. Ethereum faces pressure from substantial ETF outflows, reflecting broader sentiment issues. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, though it is expanding its DeFi use cases. Dogecoin shows increased network engagement despite stagnant prices, while Tether continues to dominate DeFi revenue and expands its blockchain presence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price fluctuations, the dormant supply and potential rate cuts support a moderately positive outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant ETF outflows and institutional demand concerns weigh on Ethereum, suggesting a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana is expanding its DeFi use cases, the large outflows from investment products offset potential gains, justifying a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and active addresses suggest a slight positive momentum, though price remains stagnant.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of market volatility and mixed signals from other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-19 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable U.S. economy with a moderate 10-Year Treasury Yield and a low CBOE Volatility Index, suggesting a risk-on sentiment in traditional markets. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin is under pressure despite some optimism regarding potential Fed rate cuts, with a significant portion of its supply remaining dormant, indicating strong hold sentiment. Ethereum is facing challenges due to significant ETF outflows, which have weighed on its price. Solana has seen substantial outflows from investment products, though its DeFi ecosystem is expanding. Dogecoin is witnessing increased network engagement, despite stagnant prices. Meanwhile, Tether is gaining traction with new blockchain integrations and strong DeFi revenue performance, indicating its continued importance in the crypto ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, the anticipation of Fed rate cuts and strong holding sentiment provide a cautiously optimistic outlook.

ETH: -0.2 — The significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand suggest caution, despite some resilience in price.

SOL: +0.1 — While facing investment outflows, the expansion of DeFi use cases provides some support for Solana's long-term potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased network engagement is positive, but price stagnation and lack of strong bullish signals keep the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of mixed signals across other assets and strong DeFi revenue, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent for risk management."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward movement due to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant portion of its supply remaining dormant, indicating strong holding sentiment. Ethereum faces challenges with substantial ETF outflows and reduced institutional demand, although recent price stability suggests a potential bottoming. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, but new DeFi use cases could bolster its ecosystem. Dogecoin shows increased network engagement despite stagnant prices, reflecting a resilient community. Tether remains a stable choice, with strong DeFi revenue generation and expansion into new blockchains.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The anticipation of Fed rate cuts and strong holding sentiment provide a positive outlook, although technical indicators are currently neutral.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and reduced institutional interest weigh on Ethereum, despite stable recent price action.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with substantial outflows from investment products countered by new DeFi use cases, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network activity suggests growing engagement, but price stagnation limits strong bullish sentiment.

USDT: +0.1 — While generally stable, the current market environment suggests maintaining a moderate allocation to USDT as a hedge against volatility."
2024-08-19 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by potential Federal Reserve rate cuts that are boosting confidence in the crypto markets, particularly for Bitcoin. Despite this, Ethereum is facing pressure from significant ETF outflows, indicating a mixed sentiment. Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, but its DeFi ecosystem is expanding, which could signal long-term growth potential. Dogecoin shows strong network engagement despite stagnant prices, suggesting underlying community support. Tether remains a stable presence, with recent developments on the Aptos blockchain and leading DeFi revenue generation, indicating its continued utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts and strong holding patterns suggest a moderate buy signal, despite technical indicators showing no immediate bullish momentum.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh on Ethereum, suggesting a cautious approach despite its foundational role in the crypto ecosystem.

SOL: +0.2 — While facing large outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases could provide long-term growth opportunities, warranting a slight positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite increased network activity, the lack of significant price movement or bullish technical signals suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.1 — With market conditions showing cautious optimism, maintaining a slight preference for liquidity in USDT seems prudent to quickly capitalize on potential market shifts."
2024-08-19 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward momentum driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, technical indicators remain mixed, with no strong buy signals across major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum faces pressure from significant ETF outflows, reflecting broader sentiment challenges. Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, though its DeFi ecosystem is expanding. Dogecoin's network engagement is rising, though price action remains stagnant. Tether continues to show strength, with its expansion onto the Aptos blockchain and leading DeFi revenue generation, indicating a robust demand for stablecoin liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts and strong on-chain holding data suggest a moderate increase in allocation, despite mixed technical signals.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh on Ethereum, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Record outflows from Solana products and lack of technical buy signals suggest a slight reduction in allocation, despite DeFi expansion.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and active addresses provide a modest positive signal, though price action remains flat.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions and Tether's strong performance in DeFi, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-19 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. Bitcoin shows resilience with a significant portion of its supply being dormant, indicating strong holding sentiment among investors. However, Ethereum faces pressure from substantial ETF outflows, reflecting waning institutional interest. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, though its DeFi ecosystem is expanding with new use cases. Dogecoin's network activity is increasing despite stagnant prices, suggesting underlying community engagement. Tether remains a stable choice, with recent developments enhancing its utility and revenue generation in the DeFi space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the strong holding sentiment and potential Fed rate cuts provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued ETF outflows and reduced institutional demand weigh on Ethereum, suggesting caution despite its foundational strength.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, although new DeFi use cases provide a potential long-term positive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased network activity is positive, but price stagnation and lack of clear bullish signals warrant a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — In the current mixed market environment, maintaining a stablecoin position provides flexibility and security, especially given Tether's strong DeFi performance."
2024-08-19 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with potential bullish signals emerging for Bitcoin due to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant portion of BTC supply remaining dormant. However, Ethereum faces headwinds from substantial ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand, which could weigh on its price. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, although new DeFi use cases could provide some support. Dogecoin shows strong network engagement despite stagnant prices, while Tether continues to expand its reach and revenue, indicating robust demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts and strong on-chain holding patterns suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional interest create a bearish environment for Ethereum, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from Solana investment products indicate bearish sentiment, though new DeFi developments offer some long-term potential.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement is a positive sign, but without significant price movement, only a slight increase in allocation is justified.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity for potential future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.65. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a rebound due to anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, while Ethereum faces pressure from significant ETF outflows. Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, but its DeFi use cases are expanding. Dogecoin's network engagement is increasing despite stagnant prices, and Tether continues to dominate DeFi revenue charts, indicating strong demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive sentiment driven by potential Fed rate cuts and strong holding behavior suggests a moderate buy signal, despite current technicals showing no bullish signals.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand create a bearish outlook, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Record outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, though expanding DeFi use cases provide some support.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement and active addresses suggest a slight positive outlook, but price action remains stagnant.

USDT: +0.4 — Continued strong demand for stablecoins, as evidenced by Tether's revenue performance, suggests maintaining a healthy allocation to USDT in the current market environment."
2024-08-19 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a relatively calm market backdrop. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin shows a strong hold by investors, indicating bullish sentiment, but lacks immediate technical buy signals. Ethereum faces pressure from significant ETF outflows, reflecting weakened institutional demand. Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, though its DeFi ecosystem is expanding. Dogecoin sees increased network engagement, but price action remains stagnant. Tether continues to dominate in DeFi revenue, and its expansion onto new blockchains suggests strong utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — While technical indicators are neutral, the strong holding pattern and potential Fed rate cuts support a moderate bullish stance.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and a technical breakdown signal caution; however, long-term potential remains.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from investment products suggest caution, despite positive developments in DeFi use cases.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network activity and strong community engagement provide a slight positive outlook, though price action is flat.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment and technical signals across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-19 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by relatively stable interest rates and a moderate U.S. dollar index, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX. This suggests a neutral to slightly positive backdrop for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows signs of resilience with a significant portion of its supply being dormant, indicating strong holding sentiment despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals. Ethereum faces headwinds from significant ETF outflows, which weigh on its price despite some positive on-chain activity. Solana and Dogecoin exhibit mixed signals with Solana experiencing large investment outflows, while Dogecoin sees increased network engagement. Tether remains a stable option, benefiting from its recent expansion onto the Aptos blockchain and leading DeFi revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the strong holding sentiment and potential rate cuts create a favorable long-term outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and price pressure overshadow any positive on-chain activity, suggesting a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, although new DeFi use cases provide some support.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement is positive, but the lack of strong price momentum suggests only a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed signals across other assets and the stable macro environment, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-08-19 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment reflects a mixed environment with cautious optimism. Bitcoin is experiencing upward pressure due to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and a significant portion of its supply remains dormant, indicating strong holding behavior. Ethereum faces headwinds from substantial ETF outflows, contributing to a bearish outlook despite some positive on-chain activity. Solana is seeing significant outflows from investment products, though new DeFi applications may provide some support. Dogecoin's network engagement is increasing, but price action remains stagnant. Tether continues to expand its reach and maintain strong DeFi revenue, suggesting robust demand for stablecoins in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows resilience with strong holding behavior and potential macroeconomic tailwinds from anticipated rate cuts, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum faces significant selling pressure from ETF outflows and mixed institutional sentiment, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Despite new DeFi use cases, Solana is experiencing large outflows, indicating a need to slightly reduce holdings until market sentiment improves.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network activity suggests some underlying strength, but without significant price movement, a neutral to slight buy stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of mixed market conditions and strong DeFi performance, maintaining a healthy allocation to USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for a rebound in crypto markets driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Bitcoin shows signs of resilience with a significant portion of its supply held dormant, indicating long-term bullish sentiment. Ethereum faces headwinds from substantial ETF outflows, reflecting weakened institutional interest. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, but its DeFi ecosystem is expanding with new prediction markets. Dogecoin's network engagement is strong, as evidenced by a surge in active addresses, despite stagnant prices. Tether remains robust, with strong DeFi revenue and expansion onto new blockchains, suggesting a stable demand for USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, the long-term holding pattern and positive macroeconomic news provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued ETF outflows and lack of bullish technical indicators suggest caution, though the overall market sentiment could provide some support.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana's DeFi ecosystem is growing, the significant investment outflows and lack of technical buy signals warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network activity and engagement provide a slight positive bias, though price action remains relatively flat.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and potential for volatility, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent to manage risk and capitalize on future opportunities."
2024-08-19 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some positive developments in Bitcoin and Dogecoin activity, despite mixed signals from Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin is experiencing a rebound in optimism due to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, and a significant portion of its supply remains dormant, indicating strong holding sentiment. Ethereum faces challenges with substantial ETF outflows and a lack of institutional demand, while Solana is dealing with significant investment outflows despite expanding DeFi use cases. Dogecoin shows increased network engagement, although its price remains relatively stagnant. Tether continues to strengthen its position in DeFi, launching on new blockchains and leading in revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts and strong holding sentiment provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin, despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh on Ethereum, suggesting caution despite its foundational role in DeFi.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from Solana products and the absence of technical buy signals suggest a cautious approach, despite new DeFi developments.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and active addresses provide a slight positive signal, though price action remains subdued.

USDT: +0.3 — In the current mixed market environment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent, especially given its strong DeFi performance and new blockchain integrations."
2024-08-19 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which have bolstered confidence in the crypto markets. Bitcoin shows signs of bullish sentiment with a significant portion of its supply being held dormant, indicating investor confidence. However, Ethereum faces challenges with substantial ETF outflows and mixed institutional interest. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, though new DeFi use cases are emerging. Dogecoin shows increased network engagement despite stagnant prices. Tether remains strong, with new blockchain integrations and leading DeFi revenue generation, suggesting its continued utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts and strong on-chain holding patterns support a bullish outlook, despite mixed technical signals.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and lack of strong technical or on-chain signals suggest caution, though long-term potential remains.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite large outflows, new DeFi developments could support future growth, but immediate sentiment is mixed.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased network activity is positive, but without significant price movement or strong technical signals, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — While generally a safe haven, its strong DeFi performance and new blockchain integration suggest maintaining some exposure amid potential market volatility."
2024-08-19 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate buy signals, the anticipation of rate cuts and strong long-term holding patterns suggest a positive outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and lack of bullish technical signals warrant caution, though on-chain activity remains a supportive factor.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with significant outflows from investment products balanced by expanding DeFi use cases. Neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement is a positive sign, but price action remains stagnant. A slight positive bias due to strong community activity.

USDT: -0.4 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there's potential for capital rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-19 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.65. The U.S. dollar index is moderately strong at 101.89, and the S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing a rebound driven by expectations of potential Fed rate cuts, with 75% of its supply being dormant, indicating strong holding sentiment. Ethereum is facing pressure from significant ETF outflows, while Solana is seeing substantial outflows from investment products despite new DeFi developments. Dogecoin's network engagement is increasing, as shown by a surge in active addresses, while Tether continues to expand its presence with a launch on the Aptos blockchain and leading DeFi revenue charts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is showing bullish momentum with positive sentiment driven by potential Fed rate cuts and strong holding behavior. This makes BTC relatively attractive in the current market environment.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand, which outweighs any short-term technical signals.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite new DeFi developments, Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, balancing out any potential bullish sentiment.

DOGE: +0.2 — The increase in active addresses suggests strong network engagement, which could support price stability or modest gains, but the overall market sentiment remains mixed.

USDT: +0.1 — While generally a safe haven, Tether's expansion on the Aptos blockchain and strong DeFi revenue performance support a slightly positive outlook, though the stablecoin's role in a risk-on environment is limited."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential rebound driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite a prolonged holding pattern by investors, Bitcoin's on-chain activity remains relatively low. Ethereum faces challenges due to significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand, although the network remains fundamentally strong. Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, but its DeFi ecosystem is expanding with new prediction markets. Dogecoin is seeing a surge in active addresses, indicating strong network engagement despite stagnant prices. Tether continues to dominate DeFi revenue charts and is expanding its presence with a launch on the Aptos blockchain.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts and strong holding behavior suggest a bullish outlook, despite low on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weak institutional demand weigh on sentiment, though technicals remain stable.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases and bullish momentum signal a moderate positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement is a positive sign, but price stagnation tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential capital rotation into riskier assets due to improving market sentiment, USDT may see reduced demand."
2024-08-19 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward momentum driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant portion of BTC supply remaining dormant, indicating strong holding sentiment. Ethereum faces headwinds from substantial ETF outflows and mixed sentiment, though recent technical indicators suggest some bullish momentum. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, but its expanding DeFi use cases may offer long-term potential. Dogecoin shows strong network engagement with a surge in active addresses, despite stagnant prices. Tether remains a stable choice, with recent developments enhancing its utility and revenue generation in the DeFi space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts and strong holding behavior, coupled with bullish momentum indicators, suggest an attractive opportunity for increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum, significant ETF outflows and mixed sentiment create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance for now.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from investment products and recent price declines suggest caution, although DeFi developments could provide future support.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased network activity and engagement, alongside bullish momentum indicators, make Dogecoin relatively attractive despite price stagnation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-19 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals; Bitcoin shows bullish momentum and a strong hold by investors, suggesting optimism fueled by potential Fed rate cuts. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to significant ETF outflows, despite some positive on-chain activity. Solana is witnessing substantial outflows from investment products, but its DeFi ecosystem is expanding with new use cases. Dogecoin's network engagement is rising, although price action remains stagnant. Tether maintains its stability and shows strong revenue generation in the DeFi space, indicating its continued utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum and investor holding patterns, along with macroeconomic optimism, suggest a strong buy signal. The potential for rate cuts further supports upward pressure.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite some positive momentum signals, significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh heavily on Ethereum, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — While facing investment outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases and consistent bullish momentum provide a modest buy signal.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement and bullish momentum suggest a slight positive outlook, though price action remains largely unchanged.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally bullish sentiment in the market and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-08-19 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility (VIX at 14.65) and a moderate U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 101.89), which generally supports risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, supported by optimistic expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and strong on-chain holding patterns. Ethereum faces headwinds from significant ETF outflows, although its technical indicators show some bullish momentum. Solana is seeing mixed signals, with technical indicators suggesting buying opportunities despite significant outflows from investment products. Dogecoin shows increased network activity, which may indicate growing interest, although its price remains largely unchanged. Tether continues to expand its utility with new blockchain integrations and strong DeFi revenue performance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin exhibits strong bullish momentum and positive sentiment driven by potential rate cuts and long-term holding patterns, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite some bullish technical momentum, Ethereum is weighed down by significant ETF outflows and mixed sentiment, suggesting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's technical indicators are positive, and the introduction of new DeFi use cases could bolster its attractiveness, despite recent outflows.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network activity suggests growing interest, but with no significant price movement, a modest positive allocation is warranted.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the overall risk-on sentiment and positive momentum in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets seems prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of resilience due to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant portion of its supply being held long-term. Ethereum faces headwinds from significant ETF outflows, indicating waning institutional interest, although on-chain activity remains stable. Solana has experienced notable outflows from investment products, but its DeFi ecosystem is expanding with new use cases. Dogecoin's network engagement is strong, as evidenced by a surge in active addresses, despite price stagnation. Tether continues to solidify its position in the DeFi space with high revenue generation and expansion onto new blockchains.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum and positive news regarding potential rate cuts support a favorable outlook. The significant portion of dormant supply also indicates strong holding sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the substantial ETF outflows and mixed sentiment from recent news suggest a cautious approach, maintaining a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — While facing investment outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases and consistent bullish momentum warrant a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses indicates strong network engagement, justifying a slight positive bias despite stagnant prices.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable."
2024-08-19 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by potential Fed rate cuts and a significant portion of its supply being dormant, indicating bullish sentiment. Ethereum is facing challenges due to significant ETF outflows, although its technical indicators remain positive. Solana is experiencing negative sentiment due to substantial outflows from investment products, despite ongoing developments in its DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin shows strong network engagement with a surge in active addresses, while Tether remains stable, expanding its presence on the Aptos blockchain and leading in DeFi revenue.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum with positive macroeconomic news and a significant portion of its supply being held long-term, indicating investor confidence.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, and the market sentiment is stabilizing, suggesting a cautious but optimistic outlook.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana faces negative sentiment due to record outflows from investment products, outweighing the positive developments in its DeFi use cases.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement with a surge in active addresses suggests underlying strength, though price movement remains stagnant.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-08-19 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Dogecoin showing strong upward momentum and positive on-chain activity. Bitcoin's potential rebound is fueled by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, while Dogecoin benefits from increased network engagement. Ethereum faces headwinds due to significant ETF outflows, although its technical indicators remain positive. Solana is experiencing mixed signals, with substantial outflows from investment products but new DeFi use cases emerging. Tether continues to solidify its position in the DeFi space with strong revenue and new blockchain integrations, though its role as a stablecoin suggests a more defensive posture in the current market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with positive macroeconomic news, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite ETF outflows, Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, and the market may stabilize as broader sentiment improves.

SOL: +0.1 — Mixed signals with significant outflows but potential growth in DeFi use cases; cautious optimism is warranted.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased network engagement and strong technical indicators support a positive outlook for Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism surrounding potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity related to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable price increases, supported by positive momentum signals and strong on-chain activity. Solana is benefiting from international ETF developments, although U.S. regulatory concerns persist. Dogecoin has seen a price surge fueled by social media hype and increased miner accumulation.

ETH: +0.6 — Following Bitcoin's lead, Ethereum shows bullish momentum and price breakout potential. Positive macroeconomic signals and dovish Fed expectations provide additional support.

DOGE: +0.3 — Social media-driven price surge and miner accumulation support a bullish outlook, but lower on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm slightly.

USDT: -0.4 — While demand for stablecoins remains strong, the current bullish market sentiment suggests capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing the relative attractiveness of holding USDT."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity surrounding the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both shown strong upward momentum, with price increases around 4%, supported by positive news and technical indicators. Solana is experiencing mixed signals due to regulatory developments, but the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive sign. Dogecoin has seen a price boost from social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's comments. Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, which could support broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding options activity and potential rate cuts make BTC highly attractive. Current holdings should be increased to capitalize on the bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the overall positive market sentiment and dovish expectations from the Fed. Its correlation with BTC supports a favorable allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite regulatory concerns in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. The asset's technical indicators remain strong, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While the recent price surge is largely driven by social media hype, the asset's technical indicators are positive. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted, but the speculative nature of the move suggests restraint.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to take advantage of potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-20 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity related to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable price increases, reflecting strong trader optimism. Solana is experiencing mixed signals due to regulatory developments, with positive news from Brazil contrasting with setbacks in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price surge fueled by social media hype, particularly due to Elon Musk's influence. Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, which could support broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with significant price increases and positive news around options activity and potential rate cuts. This makes BTC attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is benefiting from the same macroeconomic factors as Bitcoin, with strong bullish momentum and positive price action, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. However, the mixed regulatory environment tempers the enthusiasm slightly.

DOGE: +0.5 — The social media-driven price surge and accumulation by miners indicate positive sentiment and momentum, making DOGE appealing for short-term allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's minting activity suggests robust demand, the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a rotation away from stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Follows Bitcoin's bullish momentum with positive sentiment from anticipated dovish Fed signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news from Brazil regarding ETF approval, but tempered by regulatory concerns in the U.S.

DOGE: +0.5 — Price boost from social media hype and accumulation by miners indicates potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.4 — Strong demand for USDT, but given the bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation into riskier assets is likely."
2024-08-20 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity related to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable price increases, supported by positive news and technical indicators. Solana is facing mixed news, with positive developments in Brazil but regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price boost from social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's comments. Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, which could support broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news and technical indicators, including a potential breakout. The bullish sentiment around macroeconomic factors further supports an increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is rallying alongside Bitcoin, with positive momentum and technical indicators. The anticipation of dovish signals from the Fed adds to the bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — While Solana has positive developments in Brazil, regulatory concerns in the U.S. temper enthusiasm. However, the overall market sentiment and technical indicators remain supportive.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's price increase driven by social media hype and accumulation by miners suggests potential for further gains, despite the lack of significant technical changes.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment in the crypto market, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by optimism surrounding potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity related to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced price surges, reflecting positive trader sentiment. Solana is seeing mixed signals with regulatory challenges in the U.S. but positive developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has been buoyed by social media hype, particularly from Elon Musk's cryptic references, leading to a notable price increase. Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding options activity and potential rate cuts support a bullish outlook. On-chain activity is robust, indicating strong interest.

ETH: +0.7 — Following Bitcoin's lead, Ethereum is also benefiting from positive sentiment and potential dovish Fed signals. Technical indicators remain bullish.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, suggesting increased institutional interest.

DOGE: +0.3 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation indicate positive sentiment, though the hype-driven nature suggests a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's minting activity indicates demand, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests a rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors and asset-specific developments. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both seen price surges, fueled by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and increased options activity. Solana is experiencing mixed signals due to regulatory developments, with positive news from Brazil contrasted by concerns in the U.S. Dogecoin has benefited from social media hype, particularly due to Elon Musk's influence, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with significant on-chain activity and positive news around options activity and potential rate cuts, making it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum mirrors Bitcoin's bullish sentiment with similar macroeconomic drivers and strong technical indicators, warranting a high allocation score.

SOL: +0.3 — While Solana faces regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, supporting a moderate allocation increase.

DOGE: +0.5 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation indicate a favorable environment for Dogecoin, justifying a moderate allocation boost.

USDT: -0.3 — Despite strong demand indicated by recent minting, the overall bullish sentiment across other assets suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on growth opportunities elsewhere."
2024-08-20 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which has positively impacted both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge, bolstered by substantial options activity and trader optimism. Ethereum has mirrored Bitcoin's upward movement, reflecting the broader market's anticipation of dovish signals from the Fed. Solana has experienced mixed news, with positive developments in Brazil contrasted by regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price boost due to social media hype, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests robust demand and potential for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and increased options activity, suggests continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Follows Bitcoin's upward trend with positive market sentiment driven by potential Fed rate cuts.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive developments in Brazil with the approval of a Solana-based ETF, though tempered by U.S. regulatory challenges.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increase and miner accumulation support a mild bullish stance.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment leans bullish, capital rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets is likely."
2024-08-20 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced price surges, indicating strong trader interest and positive momentum. Solana's market is mixed, with positive developments in Brazil but regulatory concerns in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price boost from social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's comments. Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, although this could also signal a potential rally in the broader crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations support a bullish outlook. On-chain activity also shows increased transactions, reinforcing the buy signal.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum mirrors Bitcoin's bullish momentum with similar rate-cut expectations. The technical indicators are positive, and the correlation with Bitcoin suggests a favorable environment for growth.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. The technical indicators remain bullish, but the regulatory uncertainty tempers enthusiasm slightly.

DOGE: +0.5 — The recent price jump driven by social media hype and accumulation by miners suggests a positive short-term outlook. However, the reliance on external factors like Elon Musk's influence introduces some volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — While there is strong demand for USDT, the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets. The recent minting activity could indicate upcoming market rallies, reducing the need for holding stablecoins."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and positive developments in the ETF space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced a price surge of approximately 4%, buoyed by trader optimism and substantial options activity. Solana is seeing mixed signals; while Brazil's approval of a Solana-based ETF is positive, the SEC's scrutiny in the U.S. raises regulatory concerns. Dogecoin has benefited from social media hype, particularly due to Elon Musk's cryptic references, resulting in a notable price increase. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, although it may also indicate a cautious market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Strong upward momentum and positive news around options activity and potential rate cuts make BTC attractive. On-chain activity also supports a bullish stance.

**ETH: +0.7** — Following Bitcoin's lead, Ethereum benefits from similar bullish sentiment and dovish Fed expectations. Technical indicators remain positive.

**SOL: +0.3** — While the Brazilian ETF approval is a positive development, U.S. regulatory concerns temper enthusiasm. Nonetheless, the overall sentiment remains slightly positive.

**DOGE: +0.5** — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation provide a bullish outlook, though the hype-driven nature warrants some caution.

**USDT: -0.5** — As risk appetite increases with positive market sentiment, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected."
2024-08-20 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by positive macroeconomic expectations such as potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which has led to a rally in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge is further supported by substantial options activity, while Ethereum follows closely due to its correlation with Bitcoin. Solana's market sentiment is mixed due to regulatory developments, with positive news from Brazil being offset by regulatory hurdles in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a boost from social media hype, particularly linked to Elon Musk's activities. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, potentially indicating broader market confidence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with supportive macroeconomic news and increased on-chain activity. The positive sentiment from potential rate cuts and options activity boosts confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Following Bitcoin's lead with positive momentum and macroeconomic signals. The market anticipates dovish Fed signals, supporting Ethereum's price action.

SOL: +0.3 — Mixed sentiment due to regulatory issues in the U.S., but positive developments in Brazil provide some support. Overall, maintain a cautious positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media hype and miner accumulation provide a short-term boost, but the lack of sustained on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — Despite strong demand indicated by recent minting, the overall market's risk-on sentiment suggests a rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, which has led to a recent rally in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged due to substantial options activity and optimism surrounding the U.S. election, while Ethereum has mirrored this movement. Solana is experiencing mixed signals; although a new ETF was approved in Brazil, regulatory concerns in the U.S. have created uncertainty. Dogecoin has seen a price boost from social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's activities. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand, suggesting potential for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, driven by options activity and rate-cut expectations, make BTC attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Following Bitcoin's rally and positive macroeconomic expectations, ETH is likely to benefit from similar upward momentum, though slightly less pronounced.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation suggest potential short-term gains, but the speculative nature warrants caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities."
2024-08-20 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive price movement in line with Bitcoin, with expectations of favorable macroeconomic developments. However, technical indicators are less robust than BTC.

SOL: +0.3 — Mixed sentiment due to regulatory concerns in the U.S., but positive developments in Brazil and stable technical indicators suggest moderate confidence.

DOGE: +0.2 — Price increase driven by social media hype and miner accumulation, but the lack of strong technical support suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with recent news and macroeconomic indicators suggesting potential upward momentum. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both seen price surges driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, alongside significant options activity. Solana's market is buoyed by the approval of a new ETF in Brazil, although regulatory concerns in the U.S. pose some uncertainty. Dogecoin has experienced a price boost due to social media activity and miner accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite a recent price dip, strong upward momentum and positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations suggest a favorable outlook.

ETH: +0.4 — While technical indicators are mixed, the positive correlation with Bitcoin and anticipation of dovish Fed signals provide support for a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — The approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, though regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. tempers enthusiasm slightly.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation suggest a cautiously optimistic stance, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the current market optimism, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as capital may rotate into more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and positive developments in the crypto space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience with a notable price rebound, supported by increased options activity and anticipation of rate cuts. Solana faces mixed news, with regulatory challenges in the U.S. but positive developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent price boost due to social media hype and miner accumulation. Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand, potentially supporting broader market rallies. However, recent price fluctuations suggest some volatility, warranting a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with positive news and increased on-chain activity. The expectation of rate cuts further supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.4 — Ethereum benefits from the positive macroeconomic outlook and follows Bitcoin's upward trend, though technical indicators are mixed.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation provide a short-term boost, but caution is advised due to potential volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in the crypto market, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-08-20 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing a rebound driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and increased options activity. Solana's market is mixed, with positive developments in Brazil contrasted by regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price boost due to social media hype, particularly linked to Elon Musk's cryptic references. Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, which could potentially support broader market rallies. However, the macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced approach to risk exposure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows signs of recovery with positive news and a slight price increase. The overall sentiment is optimistic, but technical indicators are mixed, suggesting a cautious buy.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum is benefiting from similar macroeconomic drivers as Bitcoin, though technical signals remain weak. The potential for dovish Fed signals supports a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana faces regulatory hurdles in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. However, technical indicators are not strongly supportive, warranting a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.1 — Dogecoin has experienced a price jump due to social media hype, but the technical signals are not strong enough to justify a significant allocation increase.

USDT: -0.1 — With a slight positive sentiment in the market, there is a modest shift away from stablecoins like USDT, though it remains a necessary hedge against volatility."
2024-08-20 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of recovery driven by expectations of a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin's price has rebounded significantly, supported by substantial options activity and positive news regarding potential rate cuts. Ethereum is following a similar trajectory, benefiting from the broader market optimism.

BTC: +0.6 — Positive price momentum and supportive news about potential rate cuts and options activity suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite recent volatility.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is benefiting from the same macroeconomic factors as Bitcoin, with a slight price increase and positive sentiment from dovish Fed expectations.

SOL: +0.3 — While Solana faces regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil and overall positive sentiment support a modestly bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.4 — Recent social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation indicate positive sentiment, although the lack of strong technical signals suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite strong demand indicated by recent minting activity, the overall market sentiment is shifting towards riskier assets, warranting a neutral stance on USDT."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable upward movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and increased options activity. This optimism is further supported by news of Bitcoin and Ethereum rallying approximately 4%. Solana has mixed signals; while it benefits from international ETF approvals, regulatory concerns in the U.S. create uncertainty. Dogecoin has seen a price boost due to social media hype and accumulation by miners. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, potentially indicating a readiness for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by positive news and trader optimism. The recent price surge and options activity around macro events provide a supportive backdrop for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive correlation with Bitcoin's rally and anticipation of favorable macroeconomic developments. Despite technical signals being neutral, the news sentiment is bullish.

SOL: +0.3 — While the international ETF approval is a positive development, U.S. regulatory concerns temper enthusiasm. Nonetheless, the overall sentiment is slightly positive.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation suggest potential for further gains, though the technical outlook remains neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-08-20 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and positive developments in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown a significant rebound, supported by trader optimism and substantial options activity. Solana is experiencing mixed signals, with positive news from Brazil regarding a new ETF, but regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price boost due to social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's cryptic references. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, potentially signaling broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's price surge and positive news around options activity and rate-cut expectations suggest a favorable environment for further gains. The overall market optimism supports a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price increase in tandem with Bitcoin, along with expectations of dovish Fed signals, warrants a moderately positive outlook despite technical indicators not yet turning bullish.

SOL: +0.3 — The approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, though tempered by regulatory concerns in the U.S. This mixed sentiment leads to a cautious but positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price increases driven by social media hype and miner accumulation suggest a slight positive bias, though the lack of strong technical signals keeps the score moderate.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the recent minting activity indicating demand, the overall market optimism and potential for capital rotation into riskier assets suggest holding a neutral position in stablecoins."
2024-08-20 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing a notable rebound driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and substantial options activity. This optimism is reflected in the recent price surges of both assets. Solana's market is mixed; while there is positive news from Brazil regarding ETF approvals, regulatory challenges in the U.S. create uncertainty. Dogecoin has seen a price boost due to social media hype and accumulation by miners, though on-chain activity remains low. Tether's recent minting indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader crypto market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive news and price momentum, coupled with increased trader optimism, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderate score.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price movement aligns with Bitcoin's rally, supported by expectations of favorable Fed actions. Despite neutral technicals, the positive sentiment justifies a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — While the Brazilian ETF approval is a positive development, regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. tempers enthusiasm. The score reflects cautious optimism given the mixed news environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite low on-chain activity, social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation provide a short-term boost. The score reflects potential for further gains, albeit with caution.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and potential for broader market rallies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable upward momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum due to expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity. This has led to a rebound in prices, suggesting a potential shift towards risk-on sentiment. Solana's market is mixed, with positive developments in Brazil countered by regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a speculative price jump driven by social media hype, while Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive price momentum and optimistic sentiment around macroeconomic factors and options activity suggest potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum benefits from positive macroeconomic expectations and price movement, though slightly less pronounced.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory hurdles in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, supporting a modest bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increase and miner accumulation suggest potential for continued speculative interest, though with higher volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2024-08-20 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and positive developments in the crypto space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced price rebounds, likely influenced by trader optimism and the anticipation of rate cuts. Solana's market is buoyed by the approval of a new ETF in Brazil, although regulatory concerns in the U.S. remain. Dogecoin has seen a price boost from social media hype, particularly due to Elon Musk's cryptic mention. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially setting the stage for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations are supporting Bitcoin's price. Despite recent technical indicators showing no buy signals, the overall sentiment and macroeconomic context are favorable.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is benefiting from similar macroeconomic factors as Bitcoin, with expectations of dovish Fed signals. The recent price increase aligns with Bitcoin's movement, suggesting a supportive environment.

SOL: +0.3 — The approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, though tempered by regulatory concerns in the U.S. The overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation suggest a positive sentiment, although the technical indicators do not show strong buy signals.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the optimistic sentiment and potential for broader market rallies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns from other crypto assets."
2024-08-21 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows potential for a short-squeeze rally due to crowded short positions, despite a large Mt. Gox transfer that is unlikely to cause significant selling pressure. Ethereum sees strong institutional interest with the first ETH ETF hitting a $1 billion milestone, suggesting a potential bullish setup. Solana faces some selling pressure from a major whale, but regulatory developments in Brazil could provide a supportive backdrop. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in trading activity and price due to Elon Musk's influence, indicating renewed retail interest. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT and plans for a UAE dirham-pegged stablecoin suggest potential bullish flows, although the overall macroeconomic context remains stable with no significant changes in traditional financial indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Potential for a short-squeeze rally and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfer support a moderate bullish stance.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and potential bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics warrant increased exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Regulatory support in Brazil is positive, but recent whale selling tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased retail interest and trading activity driven by Elon Musk's influence suggest a moderate buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintain a neutral stance as there is no immediate need to increase stablecoin exposure amidst mixed crypto signals."
2024-08-21 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF, and an increase in on-chain supply, suggesting a possible bullish setup. Solana's market activity is influenced by significant whale selling, but regulatory support in Brazil provides a positive backdrop. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and price, largely driven by Elon Musk's influence, indicating heightened retail interest. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests anticipation of increased market activity, although its role as a stablecoin typically reflects a conservative stance in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Potential for a short-squeeze and minimal selling pressure from Mt. Gox news suggest a moderate bullish outlook, though technical indicators remain neutral.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply provide a positive signal, despite neutral technical indicators.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with significant whale selling offset by regulatory support in Brazil. No clear directional bias at this time.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased retail interest and trading activity driven by Elon Musk's influence provide a moderate bullish signal, but technicals remain neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish setups in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-08-21 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic indicators suggest a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.27. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short-squeeze due to crowded short positions, which could lead to a price surge. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the significant inflows into the iShares Ethereum Trust, despite a recent increase in on-chain supply. Solana's market is influenced by regulatory developments in Brazil, while Dogecoin has seen a boost in retail interest following a social media post by Elon Musk. Tether's recent minting activity and plans for a new stablecoin indicate a strategic expansion, although it remains a stable asset in the portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The potential for a short-squeeze and limited market impact from the Mt. Gox transfer suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand and potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply provide a positive outlook for Ethereum, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Regulatory support in Brazil and consistent on-chain activity suggest a stable environment for Solana, although recent whale selling activity tempers enthusiasm slightly.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed retail interest and increased trading activity following Elon Musk's post provide a short-term boost, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the potential for bullish movements in other assets, it is advisable to reduce stablecoin holdings and reallocate capital to more promising opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a moderate U.S. Dollar Index, suggesting a neutral backdrop for risk assets. Across the crypto market, technical indicators show a lack of strong buy signals, with most assets trading within normal ranges and below key moving averages. However, news highlights potential bullish catalysts: Bitcoin faces a short-squeeze risk, Ethereum sees strong institutional interest, and Dogecoin benefits from renewed retail enthusiasm driven by Elon Musk's influence. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity could indicate increased demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite technical neutrality, the potential for a short squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers suggest a bullish setup.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional inflows and potential bullish on-chain supply dynamics support a positive outlook, despite technical neutrality.

SOL: +0.2 — Regulatory support in Brazil and a stable technical environment provide a slight positive bias, though recent whale selling tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading activity and market cap growth, spurred by Elon Musk's influence, suggest a short-term positive sentiment.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish flows into risk assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent to capitalize on emerging opportunities in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-21 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several key developments potentially influencing short-term movements. Bitcoin's derivatives market signals a potential short-squeeze, which could lead to a sharp upside if triggered. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of BlackRock's ETH ETF, despite a recent increase in supply on exchanges. Solana's regulatory acceptance in Brazil and the approval of a second spot ETF could bolster investor confidence, although a major whale has been offloading holdings. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in interest and trading activity following a positive post from Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion with a new UAE dirham-pegged stablecoin and significant USDT minting suggests a strategic positioning for future bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The potential for a short-squeeze and minimal impact from Mt. Gox BTC transfers suggest a favorable environment for upside movement.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand and ETF inflows indicate positive sentiment, despite increased exchange supply which may cap immediate gains.

SOL: +0.3 — Regulatory support in Brazil and ETF approval are positive, though recent whale selling tempers enthusiasm slightly.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed retail interest and increased trading activity following Elon Musk's post provide a short-term boost, but sustainability is uncertain.

USDT: -0.2 — While Tether's strategic moves are noteworthy, the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin preference."
2024-08-21 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mixed sentiment with some bullish signals emerging amidst a generally cautious backdrop. Bitcoin's derivatives market indicates a potential short-squeeze scenario, which could lead to a sharp upward movement if triggered. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by BlackRock's ETH ETF reaching significant inflows, which may bolster confidence in the asset. Solana's regulatory acceptance in Brazil and the approval of a second ETF could provide a positive tailwind, despite recent whale selling. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in interest and trading activity following a social media post by Elon Musk, indicating renewed retail engagement. Meanwhile, Tether's significant minting activity and plans for a UAE dirham-pegged stablecoin suggest a strategic expansion, although the overall market remains cautious with stablecoin allocations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short-squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers create a favorable outlook for Bitcoin, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply support a positive allocation stance for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite some whale selling, regulatory developments in Brazil and ETF approvals provide a supportive environment for Solana, justifying a slight increase in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent retail interest and trading volume spikes following Elon Musk's post suggest a cautiously optimistic view, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish flows and increased risk appetite, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on opportunities in other assets."
2024-08-21 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward momentum due to a possible short squeeze in the derivatives market. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF, suggesting a bullish setup. Solana's market is mixed, with significant whale selling but also positive regulatory developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in interest and trading activity, largely driven by social media influence from Elon Musk.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and bullish on-chain signals, alongside a recent price increase, indicate a favorable outlook for Ethereum, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite significant whale selling, the approval of another SOL ETF in Brazil provides a positive regulatory backdrop, supporting a modestly positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading activity and price movement driven by social media interest suggest potential short-term gains, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 16.27. The crypto market shows mixed signals, with Bitcoin experiencing a potential short-squeeze scenario due to crowded short positions, which could lead to upward price movements. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF to surpass $1 billion, suggesting a bullish outlook. Solana's market is influenced by substantial whale activity and regulatory developments in Brazil, which may support its price. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest and price due to social media activity, while Tether's issuance of a new stablecoin and recent minting activities indicate potential bullish flows into the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The potential for a short squeeze and minimal selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers suggest a positive outlook for Bitcoin. The recent on-chain activity surge also supports this view.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand and a bullish setup from increased on-exchange supply contribute to a favorable outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite some whale selling, the approval of a second Solana ETF in Brazil and stable on-chain activity provide a supportive environment for Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price and volume spikes driven by social media activity indicate increased retail interest, although the sustainability of this trend remains uncertain.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish flows into the crypto market, there may be a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-08-21 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.27. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals: Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze and has seen significant on-chain activity, while Ethereum benefits from strong institutional demand despite a recent price dip. Solana faces selling pressure from a major whale but gains regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and price due to Elon Musk's influence, reflecting heightened retail interest. Tether's recent issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although it remains a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a clear buy signal from technical indicators, the potential for a short squeeze and significant on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook. The news of limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox further supports this view.

ETH: +0.3 — Institutional interest and a potential bullish setup from increased exchange supply provide a positive bias, although recent price decreases warrant caution.

SOL: -0.1 — The large sell-off by a major whale creates downward pressure, but regulatory support in Brazil offers some offsetting optimism. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent.

DOGE: +0.6 — The recent surge in price and trading volume, driven by Elon Musk's influence, indicates strong retail interest and potential for further gains.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether's recent issuance suggests potential bullish flows, maintaining a neutral position is advisable given the current market dynamics and lack of USDT holdings."
2024-08-21 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows relatively stable conditions with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze due to crowded short positions, while Ethereum benefits from strong institutional interest as evidenced by the success of the iShares Ethereum Trust. Solana faces some selling pressure from a major whale, but regulatory developments in Brazil offer a positive outlook. Dogecoin is seeing renewed interest driven by social media activity, particularly from Elon Musk. Tether's recent minting activity suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin typically means it is used more as a safe haven or for liquidity purposes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.6** — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and the limited impact from Mt. Gox's BTC movement suggest a favorable setup for upward movement. The bullish momentum and on-chain activity further support a positive outlook.

**ETH: +0.5** — Institutional demand highlighted by the iShares Ethereum Trust and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply suggest a positive environment for Ethereum, despite the lack of a clear technical buy signal.

**SOL: 0.0** — While regulatory developments in Brazil are supportive, the selling pressure from a major whale and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a neutral stance.

**DOGE: +0.3** — Renewed retail interest driven by social media activity and increased trading volume indicate a positive sentiment, although the technical signals remain mixed.

**USDT: -0.4** — With the potential for bullish flows into other cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for holding USDT, suggesting a rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-21 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with bullish momentum signals in several major cryptocurrencies, notably BTC and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing potential upward pressure due to the risk of a short squeeze, while Ethereum is seeing strong institutional demand with the success of the ETH ETF. Solana faces some selling pressure from a major whale but benefits from regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest following a post by Elon Musk, indicating renewed retail engagement. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although it remains a stable asset in the portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential short squeeze risk make BTC attractive, despite the Mt. Gox transfer news which is unlikely to significantly impact the market.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional demand and a potential bullish setup due to increased on-chain supply support a positive outlook for ETH.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale selling pressure balanced by positive regulatory news in Brazil. Neutral stance as the market digests these factors.

DOGE: +0.6 — Renewed retail interest and increased trading activity following Elon Musk's post suggest potential for further upside.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a preference to rotate out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-08-21 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.27. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze due to crowded short positions and Ethereum witnessing strong institutional demand through ETF inflows. Solana's market sentiment is mixed, with significant whale selling but also regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in retail interest, driven by social media influence, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings, indicating potential bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers suggest a favorable environment for price appreciation. The overall bullish momentum supports a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand through the Ethereum ETF and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply suggest a positive outlook, despite recent price stability.

SOL: -0.1 — Despite regulatory support in Brazil, substantial whale selling creates caution. The lack of strong bullish signals in technical indicators suggests a slightly negative stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed retail interest driven by social media and increased trading activity provide a moderate positive sentiment, though the technicals remain neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and potential bullish flows into other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward movement due to the risk of a short squeeze and minimal selling pressure from the Mt. Gox transfer. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the significant inflows into the iShares Ethereum Trust, suggesting a potential bullish setup. Solana faces some selling pressure from a major whale but benefits from regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in retail interest following a post by Elon Musk, driving up trading activity and market cap. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin typically indicates a more conservative market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential for a short squeeze make BTC attractive. The minimal impact from the Mt. Gox transfer further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply suggest a favorable environment for ETH, despite mixed technical signals.

SOL: 0.0 — While regulatory support in Brazil is positive, the selling pressure from a major whale offsets this, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased retail interest and trading activity following Elon Musk's post provide a modestly positive outlook, although the technicals remain mixed.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining a lower allocation in USDT is advisable."
2024-08-21 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by the potential for a short squeeze in the derivatives market. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF, although there is a mixed signal from on-chain supply increases. Solana's market activity is subdued, with significant selling by a major whale, but regulatory developments in Brazil provide a positive backdrop. Dogecoin has seen a boost in retail interest following Elon Musk's social media activity, leading to a surge in trading volume and price. Meanwhile, Tether's recent issuance of USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although it remains a stable asset in the portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong momentum, potential short squeeze, and limited impact from Mt. Gox transfers suggest a favorable environment for price appreciation.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional demand and potential bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics provide a positive outlook, despite technical indicators not signaling a strong buy.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with significant whale selling offset by positive regulatory news in Brazil; no clear direction for immediate allocation changes.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased retail interest and trading volume following Elon Musk's post provide a short-term boost, but caution is warranted due to its volatile nature.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and potential bullish flows into other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable."
2024-08-21 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upside due to a possible short squeeze in the derivatives market. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the significant inflows into the first ETH ETF, although the increase in on-exchange supply suggests mixed signals. Solana's market activity is subdued, with significant selling pressure from a major whale, but regulatory developments in Brazil provide a positive backdrop. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and market cap, driven by renewed retail interest following Elon Musk's social media activity. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings, with significant minting activity suggesting potential bullish flows into the broader crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with the potential for a short squeeze, make BTC an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: +0.3 — Institutional demand is strong, as indicated by ETF inflows, though the rise in on-exchange supply tempers the bullish outlook slightly. Overall, ETH remains appealing.

SOL: -0.2 — Despite regulatory support in Brazil, the significant selling pressure from a major whale and recent price breakdown suggest caution is warranted.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased trading activity and positive sentiment driven by social media influence suggest a favorable environment for DOGE, warranting increased exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether's expansion and minting activity are notable, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the current market's risk appetite and potential for volatility."
2024-08-21 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Overall, the market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum and potential for a short squeeze, which could lead to further price increases. Ethereum is benefiting from strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF, although its on-chain supply increase could signal mixed short-term sentiment. Solana's market activity is mixed, with significant whale selling countered by regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest and trading activity, largely driven by Elon Musk's influence, suggesting a potential for short-term gains. Tether's issuance of new USDT and plans for a UAE dirham-pegged stablecoin indicate a strategic expansion, although its role as a stablecoin limits direct profit potential.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and the potential for a short squeeze suggest significant upside potential. The Mt. Gox news is unlikely to have a major negative impact.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional demand remains strong, as shown by the ETF inflows. While the increase in on-chain supply could be a concern, the overall sentiment is positive.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale selling and regulatory support balancing each other out. No clear short-term direction.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading activity and positive sentiment from Musk's influence suggest potential for short-term gains, but the volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with bullish signals for BTC and ETH, driven by strong on-chain activity and institutional interest. Bitcoin's potential for a short-squeeze and minimal selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers are supportive, while Ethereum benefits from significant ETF inflows and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply. Solana faces mixed signals with significant whale selling, but regulatory support in Brazil could provide a longer-term boost. Dogecoin has seen a surge in interest and trading volume, largely driven by social media influence. Tether's recent minting activity suggests preparation for increased market demand, but it remains a stable, low-volatility asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and bullish news regarding potential short-squeeze scenarios. Minimal selling pressure from Mt. Gox adds confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply suggest a favorable outlook. Technical indicators support this sentiment.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale selling pressure offset by regulatory support in Brazil. Technical indicators do not currently support a strong buy or sell stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased retail interest and trading volume driven by social media influence suggest a moderate buy signal, though caution is warranted due to volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, there is a rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals present for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's derivatives market indicates a potential short-squeeze, which could lead to a sharp price increase. Ethereum's institutional demand is highlighted by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF, suggesting strong interest despite mixed broader market conditions. Solana faces some selling pressure from a major whale, but regulatory developments in Brazil provide a supportive backdrop. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in interest, driven by social media activity and increased trading volume. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish liquidity flows, although its role as a stablecoin means its allocation should be considered in the context of overall market risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and potential short-squeeze scenario make Bitcoin attractive. The limited impact of the Mt. Gox transfer further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a potential bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics provide a favorable environment for Ethereum, despite broader market uncertainties.

SOL: -0.1 — While regulatory developments are positive, the significant whale selling pressure tempers enthusiasm. The technicals do not currently support a strong buy signal.

DOGE: +0.5 — Renewed retail interest and increased trading activity following social media influence suggest a positive short-term outlook for Dogecoin.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the recent issuance of USDT, the stablecoin's role as a safe haven suggests a neutral stance as risk appetite appears to be increasing in the broader market."
2024-08-21 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin is experiencing a notable price increase, supported by potential short-squeeze scenarios in the derivatives market, while Ethereum is seeing strong institutional demand with the success of its first ETF. Solana, despite some selling pressure from a major whale, benefits from regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has gained traction due to renewed retail interest following Elon Musk's social media activity. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin may see reduced allocation in a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential short-squeeze scenario make BTC attractive. The limited impact of Mt. Gox BTC transfers further supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Institutional demand and potential bullish setups from on-chain supply dynamics indicate a positive trend for ETH, despite broader ETF outflows.

SOL: +0.3 — Regulatory support in Brazil is a positive signal, although recent whale selling tempers enthusiasm. Overall, SOL remains a moderate buy.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased trading activity and market cap surge, driven by Elon Musk's influence, suggest a favorable environment for DOGE.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish market sentiment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT in favor of riskier assets, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-08-21 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has seen a substantial increase, supported by potential short-squeeze scenarios in the derivatives market. Ethereum also shows strong institutional demand, evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF and increased on-chain supply, suggesting a bullish setup. Solana's market activity is mixed, with a major whale selling off a significant amount of SOL, but regulatory support in Brazil could provide a positive backdrop. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in price and trading activity, driven by renewed retail interest following Elon Musk's social media activity. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of a large volume of USDT and plans for a new stablecoin indicate potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin suggests a more conservative allocation in bullish conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential short-squeeze in the derivatives market suggest further price appreciation. The Mt. Gox transfer news has minimal immediate impact, reinforcing a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.7 — Institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply support a positive outlook. The ETF milestone further bolsters confidence in ETH's upward trajectory.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite a major whale selling off SOL, regulatory support in Brazil and a slight price increase suggest cautious optimism. However, technical indicators remain mixed, warranting a moderate score.

DOGE: +0.5 — Renewed retail interest and significant trading volume increase driven by Elon Musk's influence suggest a positive sentiment, supporting a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for holding USDT."
2024-08-21 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, driven by positive technical indicators and supportive news. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, with potential short-squeeze scenarios that could further drive prices higher. Ethereum is attracting significant institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of the first ETH ETF reaching $1 billion in net inflows. Solana has mixed signals; while a major whale has been selling, regulatory support in Brazil with a new ETF could provide a positive outlook. Dogecoin has seen a resurgence in retail interest, partly fueled by Elon Musk's influence, leading to increased trading activity. Tether's recent minting activities suggest potential bullish flows, though its role as a stablecoin means it typically benefits from risk-off environments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential short-squeeze scenarios suggest further upside potential. The Mt. Gox news is unlikely to have a significant negative impact.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply support a positive outlook, despite recent price stability.

SOL: +0.3 — Regulatory support in Brazil with a new ETF is positive, but the large whale selling creates some caution. Overall, the sentiment is moderately bullish.

DOGE: +0.5 — Renewed retail interest and increased trading activity, driven by Elon Musk's influence, support a positive short-term outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-08-21 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum displaying strong upward momentum supported by technical indicators and positive news developments. Bitcoin's potential for a short-squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers suggest possible upside. Ethereum's strong institutional demand, as evidenced by BlackRock's ETF inflows, further supports a positive outlook. Solana's market is mixed, with significant whale selling countered by regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in interest, largely driven by Elon Musk's influence, indicating heightened retail engagement. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin typically sees less direct price movement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and potential short-squeeze risk suggest significant upside potential. Limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox adds to the positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a potential bullish setup due to increased on-chain supply support a positive allocation, despite recent sideways price action.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed signals with whale selling balanced by regulatory support in Brazil. Moderate positive sentiment warrants a cautious increase in exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed retail interest driven by Elon Musk's influence and increased trading activity suggest a modest positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-08-21 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several bullish indicators across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum, supported by potential short-squeeze risks in the derivatives market and minimal selling pressure from the Mt. Gox transfer. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the iShares Ethereum Trust's significant inflows, although the increase in exchange supply could signal mixed sentiment. Solana's market is buoyed by regulatory support in Brazil, despite some selling pressure from a major whale. Dogecoin has seen a surge in retail interest following Elon Musk's social media activity, leading to increased trading volume and market cap. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin typically indicates a more defensive position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential for a short squeeze make BTC attractive, with minimal impact expected from the Mt. Gox transfer.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional demand and potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply support a positive outlook, despite mixed signals from exchange inflows.

SOL: +0.3 — Regulatory support in Brazil and overall bullish momentum, though tempered by whale selling activity, suggest a moderate positive stance.

DOGE: +0.4 — Renewed retail interest and increased trading activity following Elon Musk's post provide a short-term boost to sentiment.

USDT: 0.0 — While recent minting suggests potential bullish flows, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the current risk appetite and market conditions."
2024-08-22 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite technical buy signals, the ongoing whale sales and lack of significant price movement suggest a cautious approach, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation at key support levels and positive ecosystem developments, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, indicate a favorable outlook for SOL.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest driven by Elon Musk's post provides a slight positive sentiment boost, though technicals remain largely unchanged.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2024-08-22 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a general bullish trend across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential short squeeze near $62K, supported by bullish momentum and on-chain activity. Ethereum is facing some bearish pressure due to whale sales, but it remains stable just below $2,600. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whale investors, indicating potential for upward movement, especially with new trading support from Bitget. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent activity, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings globally, maintaining its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential for a short squeeze suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin. On-chain activity supports this bullish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the presence of whale selling pressure and the need to break $3,050 for a trend reversal warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation at key support levels and positive developments in its trading ecosystem suggest potential for upward movement.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's activities and stable on-chain metrics provide a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall market showing bullish tendencies, capital rotation away from stablecoins like USDT is expected as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators despite recent price fluctuations. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short squeeze, suggesting upward pressure, while Ethereum faces bearish sentiment due to whale selling. Solana is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential for a breakout. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's social media activity. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant changes in major indices, which supports a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price volatility, Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum and potential for a short squeeze, making it attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum is under pressure from whale selling, and its inability to break key resistance levels suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

SOL: +0.6 — Accumulation by whales and positive ecosystem developments position Solana well for potential gains, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased interest from social media activity provides a slight positive sentiment boost, though technicals remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — With a stable macro environment and mixed signals across other assets, maintaining current USDT exposure is prudent to balance risk."
2024-08-22 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a mix of bullish technical indicators and some bearish news influences. Bitcoin shows signs of potential upward momentum, supported by technical indicators and a recent price increase, although the macro environment remains uncertain. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, keeping its price below a key resistance level. Solana is experiencing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential for a breakout. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by social media activity, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which may support its stability in the portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest bullish momentum, and the potential for a short squeeze could drive prices higher. However, caution is warranted due to the broader market uncertainty.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from whale sales, and its inability to break through key resistance levels suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Accumulation by whale wallets and positive developments in its ecosystem suggest potential for upward movement, making it relatively attractive.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven sentiment provides a slight positive bias, but the lack of strong technical signals keeps the score moderate.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market signals and the absence of USDT in the current portfolio, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent to allow flexibility in capital allocation."
2024-08-22 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward momentum, as indicated by a recent price increase and bullish technical signals. However, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, which could temper bullish enthusiasm. Ethereum is facing bearish pressure due to whale sales, although it remains technically supported above $2,600. Solana is experiencing accumulation by large holders, suggesting confidence in its near-term potential, bolstered by positive ecosystem developments like the addition of PYUSD trading. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by social media activity, though its technical indicators remain neutral. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which could enhance its utility but does not significantly impact its price stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing strong technical signals and potential for a short squeeze, making it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite some bearish pressure from whale sales, Ethereum's technical indicators are stable, suggesting a hold position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Accumulation by whales and positive ecosystem news provide a bullish outlook for Solana, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — While technicals are neutral, positive sentiment from social media activity justifies a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall cautious optimism in the market, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-22 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low volatility index (VIX) and steady S&P 500 performance, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin is showing signs of potential upward movement with analysts eyeing a short squeeze, while Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales. Solana is experiencing accumulation at key support levels, indicating potential for upward movement, especially with new ecosystem developments. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by social media activity, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings, which could enhance its utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price fluctuations, the potential for a short squeeze and positive momentum signals suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and the need to break significant resistance levels create a bearish sentiment for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem expansion with new stablecoin integrations provide a strong bullish case for Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven sentiment boosts interest, but technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether's expansion into new markets is positive, current market conditions do not strongly favor holding stablecoins, maintaining a neutral stance."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze as it approaches the $62K resistance level. Despite recent gains, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, which could temper bullish momentum. Ethereum is experiencing bearish pressure due to whale sales, struggling to break above $3,050 for a reversal. Solana is seeing accumulation by whales at $135, suggesting confidence in a potential breakout. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by Elon Musk's social media activity, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged token.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short squeeze and recent price gains suggest a moderately bullish outlook, though caution is warranted due to macro uncertainty.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a stable price, whale selling pressure and the need for a breakout above $3,050 keep sentiment neutral.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem developments like PYUSD trading support a positive outlook, with potential for a breakout.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's post provides a slight positive sentiment boost, though fundamentals remain unchanged.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-08-22 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 17.55. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a generally positive sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is experiencing cautious optimism with potential for a short squeeze, while Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales. Solana is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential upward movement, and Dogecoin sentiment has been revived by Elon Musk's social media activity. Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings, which could enhance its utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze, and its price action is generally positive. However, the macro environment remains cautious, which tempers the score.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from whale sales, and the need to break $3,050 to reverse sentiment suggests a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and new trading support on Solana are positive indicators, suggesting potential for upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's post provides a slight bullish sentiment, but the absence of strong technical signals keeps the score moderate.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, allowing for flexibility in reallocating capital as needed."
2024-08-22 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low VIX and a strong S&P 500, indicating a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short squeeze near $62K, supported by a recent price rise, although overall market caution persists. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, needing a breakout above $3,050 to reverse sentiment. Solana is seeing whale accumulation at $135, suggesting confidence in a potential breakout. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent activity, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged token.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite mixed momentum signals, the potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest a favorable outlook, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and the need for a significant breakout to reverse bearish sentiment justify a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and positive developments like the Bitget support for PYUSD trading indicate a bullish outlook, supporting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent sentiment boost from Elon Musk's activity provides a mild positive outlook, though technicals remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market signals and the absence of a current holding, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent."
2024-08-22 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a cautiously optimistic sentiment with Bitcoin demonstrating potential for a short squeeze near $62K, despite a macro backdrop of investor caution. Ethereum faces bearish sentiment due to whale sales, though it remains stable around the $2,600 mark. Solana benefits from whale accumulation at $135 and new trading support for PYUSD, suggesting a positive outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest a moderate buy signal, though caution is warranted due to the overall cautious market sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the selling pressure from whales and lack of significant upward momentum keep Ethereum in a neutral position.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and new trading support for PYUSD on Solana's network provide a bullish outlook, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's social media activity has improved sentiment, but without strong technical indicators, the buy signal is moderate.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of cautious optimism and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable."

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near the $62K resistance level. Despite a recent price increase, the overall macro environment remains uncertain, which is reflected in the cautious market outlook. Ethereum is facing bearish pressure due to whale sales, although it remains stable just under $2,600. Solana is experiencing positive momentum with whale accumulation at the $135 support and increased ecosystem activity due to new trading pairs. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost following Elon Musk's social media activity, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged token. Overall, the market is showing mixed signals, with some assets poised for potential gains while others face resistance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with potential for a short squeeze, supported by positive market sentiment and technical indicators.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under bearish pressure from whale sales, and technical indicators suggest resistance around current levels, warranting caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is benefiting from whale accumulation and ecosystem expansion, indicating potential for upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from social media activity is providing a modest boost, but technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed market signals, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as it provides stability amid uncertainty."
2024-08-22 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility (VIX at 17.55) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin is showing signs of potential upward movement with a possible short squeeze near $62K, supported by a recent price increase. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales, despite maintaining bullish momentum in technical indicators. Solana is experiencing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential for a breakout, while Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from social media activity. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which may enhance its appeal as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the bearish sentiment from whale sales and lack of significant price movement warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Accumulation by whale wallets and positive ecosystem developments suggest potential for a breakout, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from social media activity provides a slight positive sentiment boost, but not enough for a strong buy signal.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and potential bullish moves in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable."
2024-08-22 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near $62K, despite a recent slight decrease in price. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, but maintains bullish technical signals. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whale wallets, suggesting confidence in a potential breakout. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent AI-themed post, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with new collaborations. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a balanced risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price fluctuations, BTC shows potential for a short squeeze and maintains a buy signal on trend indicators, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — While technical indicators remain bullish, the selling pressure from whales and the need to break above $3,050 to reverse bearish sentiment warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and potential breakout signals, along with positive ecosystem developments, support a higher allocation preference.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's post and bullish momentum indicators suggest a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.3 — With overall market sentiment leaning towards cautious optimism and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is appropriate."
2024-08-22 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem expansion through new trading pairs indicate a favorable outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's social media activity provides a slight positive sentiment boost, though technicals remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stable macro conditions, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT as other assets show more potential for growth."
2024-08-22 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near $62K, supported by bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, keeping it below the critical $3,050 resistance level. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whale wallets at $135, suggesting confidence in a potential breakout. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by Elon Musk's recent AI-themed post, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged coin. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with no significant changes in interest rates or volatility, supporting a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and increased on-chain activity, coupled with potential for a short squeeze, make BTC attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Bearish sentiment from whale sales and technical breakdowns below key levels suggest reducing exposure until clearer bullish signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and positive ecosystem developments, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, support a bullish outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's influence provides a modest boost in sentiment, but lacking strong technical signals for a higher score.

USDT: 0.0 — Stable macro conditions and the absence of significant risk-off signals suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation to stablecoins."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and a stable U.S. dollar index, with the S&P 500 showing strength. Bitcoin is experiencing cautious optimism with potential for a short squeeze near $62K, while Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales. Solana shows signs of accumulation by large holders, indicating potential upward movement, supported by ecosystem developments like the addition of PYUSD trading. Dogecoin sentiment has seen a boost from social media activity, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, indicating a strategic push into new markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a recent price dip, Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and overall bullish sentiment suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and technical breakdown below $2,600 indicate a cautious stance, with potential for further downside.

SOL: +0.6 — Accumulation by whales and positive ecosystem developments support a bullish outlook, suggesting a strong buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from social media activity provides a slight positive sentiment, but no strong technical signals.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate."
2024-08-22 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a relatively calm market backdrop. Bitcoin is experiencing a cautious bullish sentiment with potential for a short squeeze, while Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales. Solana is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential upward movement, and Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent activity. Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings, which may enhance its appeal as a stable asset in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, the potential for a short squeeze and recent price resilience suggest a moderate bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and lack of bullish momentum signal a cautious stance, with potential for further downside.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and positive ecosystem developments, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, support a bullish view.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased interest from Elon Musk's activities provides a slight positive sentiment boost, though technicals remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent."
2024-08-22 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed picture with stable interest rates and a moderate level of volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a bullish sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into the crypto market. Bitcoin is experiencing cautious optimism with potential for a short squeeze, while Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales. Solana is seeing accumulation by whales, indicating potential for a breakout. Dogecoin has seen renewed interest due to social media influence, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings, which could stabilize its demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price decreases, there is potential for a short squeeze and bullish sentiment around the $62K resistance level. This, combined with the overall cautious optimism, makes BTC relatively attractive.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is facing downward pressure from whale sales and needs to break significant resistance to reverse its bearish trend. Current market data does not support a strong buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation at $135 and positive developments like PYUSD trading support a bullish outlook. SOL's technical indicators also show bullish momentum, making it a strong candidate for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven interest has revived sentiment for DOGE, but without strong technical backing, the score remains modestly positive.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market signals and the lack of strong bearish sentiment, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent to balance potential volatility in other assets."
2024-08-22 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, with the VIX at 17.55, indicating a relatively stable market. However, the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the mixed signals from major indices like the S&P 500. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is showing potential for a short squeeze, although it remains below key resistance levels. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, while Solana is seeing accumulation at support levels, suggesting potential for a breakout. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by Elon Musk's social media activity, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, potentially increasing its utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a clear buy signal from technical indicators, the potential for a short squeeze and recent price resilience suggest a moderate bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and the need to break significant resistance levels indicate a cautious stance on Ethereum.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation at support levels and ecosystem expansion through new trading pairs provide a positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased interest driven by Elon Musk's social media activity could lead to short-term gains, although technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, there is no immediate need to adjust exposure to stablecoins."
2024-08-22 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

Overall, the market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze near $62K, despite a generally cautious macroeconomic environment. Ethereum is experiencing bearish sentiment due to whale sales, while Solana is seeing accumulation by whales at a key support level, suggesting potential for a breakout. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's social media activity, though this may be short-lived. Tether is expanding its global stablecoin offerings, which could enhance its utility and demand. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility, suggest a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest a moderately bullish outlook. However, cautious macro sentiment tempers the score.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and the need to break above $3,050 for a reversal indicate a bearish sentiment, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation at $135 support and positive developments like PYUSD trading on Solana suggest a strong potential for upward movement.

DOGE: 0.1 — While there is a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's post, the lack of significant technical or on-chain changes keeps the score neutral to slightly positive.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance as the market does not show strong risk-on or risk-off signals."
2024-08-22 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward movement despite a generally cautious macro environment. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, while Solana is seeing accumulation at key support levels, suggesting potential for a breakout. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by social media activity, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with new partnerships, indicating a strategic focus on diversification.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price resilience suggest a moderate buy signal, especially with increased on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued downward pressure from whale sales and the need for a significant price breakout to reverse sentiment justify a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Accumulation by whales at support levels and positive ecosystem developments, such as new trading pairs, support a strong buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from social media activity provides a slight positive sentiment, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate, allowing for flexibility in reallocating capital as market conditions evolve."
2024-08-22 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by cautious optimism, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze near the $62K resistance level. Despite a recent price increase, the overall sentiment remains cautious due to macroeconomic uncertainties. Ethereum is experiencing bearish pressure from whale sales, suggesting a need for a significant breakout to reverse sentiment. Solana is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating potential for upward movement, especially with recent ecosystem enhancements like the addition of PYUSD trading. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from social media activity, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with a new Dirham-pegged token, reflecting its strategic global expansion.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and the need for a significant breakout to reverse bearish sentiment justify a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem enhancements provide a strong buy signal, indicating confidence in upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven sentiment boost offers a mild positive signal, but lacks substantial data support for a stronger buy.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market signals and ongoing macro uncertainties, maintaining a neutral position in stablecoins is prudent to balance risk."

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.
