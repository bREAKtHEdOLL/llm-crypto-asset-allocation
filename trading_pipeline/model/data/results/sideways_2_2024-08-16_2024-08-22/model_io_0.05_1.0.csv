2024-08-16 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop, with the U.S. Dollar Index and S&P 500 indicating moderate risk sentiment, while low volatility suggests a lack of immediate market stress. Bitcoin has recently experienced a significant price surge, although its mining profitability remains under pressure. Ethereum's gas fees have dropped to five-year lows, potentially signaling bullish sentiment, though technical patterns suggest caution. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, while USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of technical buy signals, the recent price surge and strong reversal from July lows suggest a moderate bullish sentiment. The macro environment is stable, supporting a cautious re-entry into BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees is a positive sign, potentially indicating future price increases. However, technical caution due to the rising-wedge pattern tempers enthusiasm, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, Solana remains neutral. Its recent price movements are not compelling enough to warrant a change in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows no significant changes in data or sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance in the absence of compelling market drivers.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the recent positive developments in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT is appropriate to allocate capital towards these assets, reflecting a cautious increase in risk appetite."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a recent price surge, although technical indicators remain mixed. Ethereum's gas fees have hit a five-year low, which could be a bullish signal, but there are warnings of a potential correction. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but Solana's technical indicators show some bullish momentum. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and a moderate U.S. dollar index, suggesting a balanced risk environment. Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach with a slight lean towards risk assets seems appropriate.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price surge, technical indicators do not yet confirm a strong buy signal. However, the positive news and price recovery suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — The drop in gas fees is a positive sign, but the potential for a correction tempers enthusiasm. A slight increase in allocation is justified to capture potential upside.

SOL: +0.4 — Although there is no significant news, the technical indicators show bullish momentum, and the recent price increase suggests potential gains. A moderate allocation is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the slight increase in risk appetite and the potential for gains in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly is advisable to reallocate capital towards riskier assets."
2024-08-16 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a significant price surge of approximately 5%, reclaiming levels near $59,600. This upward movement is a strong reversal from earlier lows, although mining profitability remains a concern due to rising hashrate. Ethereum is experiencing a bullish outlook with gas fees falling to 5-year lows, which historically precedes upward price movements, although there is a technical warning of potential downside risk. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but Solana shows bullish momentum in technical indicators. Tether remains stable with bullish momentum signals, indicating a potential safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The recent price surge and reclaiming of higher levels suggest a positive outlook, despite low mining profitability. The overall sentiment is bullish, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Falling gas fees and a generally bullish outlook support a moderate increase in allocation, though caution is advised due to potential downside risks highlighted by technical patterns.

SOL: +0.4 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana's bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity indicate a favorable environment for moderate capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to adjust the current allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — As market sentiment shows signs of cautious optimism, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets with potential upside."
2024-08-16 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge of approximately 5%, indicating a potential bullish reversal from recent lows. However, the macroeconomic environment remains mixed, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggesting a stable but cautious risk environment. Ethereum's drop in gas fees suggests potential bullish momentum, though technical patterns indicate possible downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news-driven changes, while Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Recent price surge and increased on-chain activity suggest a bullish outlook, though mining profitability concerns may temper long-term enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.3 — Decreased gas fees signal potential bullish momentum, but technical risks of a correction warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — Bullish momentum in technical indicators, though lacking significant news, suggests moderate potential for gains.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and potential bullish trends in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-08-16 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment reflects a cautiously optimistic sentiment, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge of approximately 5%, suggesting a potential recovery from recent lows. However, the macroeconomic context remains mixed, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, which may indicate a stable yet uncertain broader financial environment. Ethereum's declining gas fees hint at a potentially bullish outlook, though technical patterns suggest caution. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, while Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Recent price surge and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook, but mining profitability concerns warrant a moderate approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment from low gas fees, though technical risks suggest caution. Maintain a moderate positive stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Consistent bullish momentum in technical indicators, but lack of significant news tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with slight price increase and low activity; no compelling reason to adjust allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is justified to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge of around 5%, suggesting a positive reversal from recent lows. However, the macroeconomic environment remains mixed, with stable interest rates and a moderate U.S. Dollar Index. Ethereum's falling gas fees indicate potential bullish momentum, although technical patterns suggest caution. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news-driven catalysts, but Solana's technical indicators are relatively positive. Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook, though mining profitability concerns warrant a moderate approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite a potential technical correction risk, the drop in gas fees and bullish historical patterns support a cautious positive stance.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent bullish momentum signals and stable on-chain activity make Solana an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals result in a neutral stance, with no current holdings to adjust.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, some capital rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets is warranted."
2024-08-16 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a notable price surge of approximately 5%, indicating a strong reversal from recent lows. However, the macroeconomic backdrop remains mixed, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX suggesting a stable risk environment. Ethereum's falling gas fees signal a potential bullish outlook, although technical patterns suggest caution. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana's technical indicators show bullish momentum. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst these developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong price recovery and bullish momentum, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, the significant drop in gas fees and potential for upward movement support a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and a recent buy signal from the trend indicator suggest potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-08-16 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, which is a positive sign despite the recent low mining profitability. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to five-year lows, often a precursor to upward price movements, although there is a technical warning of a potential correction. Solana and Dogecoin have shown consistent bullish momentum in technical indicators, though they lack significant news catalysts. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX, and the S&P 500 showing strength, which could support risk-on behavior in crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and bullish momentum signal suggest a favorable environment for further gains, despite the low mining profitability. The overall market sentiment supports a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum's gas fees are at historic lows, indicating potential bullishness, the technical warning of a possible correction tempers enthusiasm. A moderate positive score reflects this mixed outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana shows consistent bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Despite the lack of significant news, its strong market performance warrants a favorable allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin exhibits bullish momentum but lacks significant news or strong technical signals to justify a change in allocation. A neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment in risk assets like BTC and SOL, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets, reflecting a moderate risk-on approach."
2024-08-16 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600. This upward movement is supported by bullish momentum signals and increased on-chain activity, despite challenges in mining profitability. Ethereum shows a mixed outlook; while gas fees have fallen to 5-year lows, which is typically bullish, there is a potential downside risk due to a rising-wedge technical pattern. Solana and Dogecoin have shown steady on-chain activity and bullish momentum, but lack significant news catalysts. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced risk environment, favoring a slight increase in risk exposure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong price recovery and bullish momentum signals, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. Despite mining profitability concerns, the overall sentiment is positive.

ETH: +0.3 — While gas fees are at a 5-year low, indicating potential bullishness, the technical pattern suggests caution. The mixed signals warrant a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and positive trend signals, along with stable on-chain activity, make Solana an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the lack of significant news and relatively stable price movements suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong price recovery and Ethereum benefiting from reduced gas fees, which historically precedes upward price movement. Bitcoin's mining profitability remains a concern, but the price surge suggests renewed investor interest. Ethereum's technicals present mixed signals, with a potential correction looming unless key resistance is broken. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but their technical indicators show bullish momentum. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on approach, though caution is warranted given the potential for corrections in major assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's price surge and bullish momentum, coupled with strong on-chain activity, suggest continued upward potential despite mining profitability concerns.

ETH: +0.3 — Reduced gas fees and bullish momentum are positive, but the potential correction risk tempers enthusiasm. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, along with stable on-chain activity, support a positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the lack of significant news or strong technical signals leads to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of a moderate risk-on environment, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-16 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin has experienced a recent price surge, indicating a potential bullish reversal, although mining profitability remains a concern. Ethereum's drop in gas fees suggests a bullish outlook, but technical patterns warn of potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin show consistent bullish momentum in technical indicators, while Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Recent price surge and bullish momentum signals indicate a positive outlook, although mining profitability concerns warrant some caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and low gas fees are promising, but potential downside risks from technical patterns suggest a moderate allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and technical buy signals make Solana attractive in the current market environment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite no significant news, the bullish momentum suggests a slight positive allocation, but lack of strong catalysts limits enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-08-16 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, driven by strong on-chain activity and positive momentum indicators. However, mining profitability concerns could pose a longer-term risk. Ethereum shows a mixed outlook; while gas fees have fallen to historic lows, suggesting potential upward movement, technical patterns indicate possible downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news but maintain bullish technical signals. The macroeconomic environment, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a moderate risk-on sentiment, though the U.S. dollar remains strong, which could cap upside potential.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong upward momentum and recent price surge suggest continued bullishness, though mining profitability concerns warrant some caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and low gas fees are positive, but technical risks from a rising-wedge pattern suggest a balanced approach.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent bullish technical indicators and no negative news support a positive outlook, despite recent price volatility.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity provide a slightly positive outlook, though lacking significant news.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, reducing stablecoin holdings to allocate more capital to riskier assets seems prudent."
2024-08-16 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum despite recent price declines. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, although mining profitability is under pressure due to increased hashrate. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to five-year lows, potentially signaling a bullish outlook, but technical patterns suggest possible downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but both exhibit positive technical indicators. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on environment, suggesting potential capital rotation away from stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong on-chain activity suggest upward momentum, although mining profitability concerns may temper enthusiasm slightly.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite potential downside risks from technical patterns, the significant drop in gas fees and historical precedents suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive technical indicators and strong on-chain activity support a moderate buy signal, despite the lack of significant news.

DOGE: 0.0 — While technical indicators are generally positive, the absence of significant news or developments suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the overall bullish sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT seems prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600, which indicates strong upward momentum. However, mining profitability remains low, which could pose a risk if not offset by continued price strength. Ethereum's gas fees have fallen to five-year lows, suggesting potential bullishness, although a technical pattern indicates possible downside risk. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news-driven changes, but both exhibit some technical weakness. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, which may support risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price recovery and bullish momentum, despite low mining profitability, suggest continued upside potential. The recent price surge and positive on-chain activity support a higher allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Although there is a potential technical downside risk, the significant drop in gas fees and overall bullish momentum provide a positive outlook. The potential for upward movement outweighs the technical warning.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, Solana's technical indicators are neutral, and the lack of significant news limits the conviction for a strong allocation change.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral stance. The recent price increase is not supported by strong momentum or news.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall slight bullish sentiment in the market, there is a moderate preference to rotate some capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and ETH, which show stronger potential for gains."
2024-08-16 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a recent price surge of around 5%, indicating a potential recovery from earlier lows. However, the macroeconomic context remains mixed, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggesting a stable yet uncertain environment. Ethereum is experiencing a significant drop in gas fees, which historically precedes upward price movements, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana's technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook. Tether remains stable, as expected, with no significant changes in its market data.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the recent price surge and positive momentum signals, the low mining profitability could limit upside potential. However, the overall sentiment and technical indicators remain supportive.

ETH: +0.3 — The drop in gas fees is a bullish signal, but the potential downside risk from the rising-wedge pattern tempers enthusiasm. The overall outlook is cautiously positive.

SOL: -0.2 — The lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators, including a breakdown below the Bollinger Bands, suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintain a neutral stance. The recent activity surge is not enough to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — In light of the cautiously optimistic sentiment in the broader crypto market, reduce exposure to stablecoins to allocate more capital towards potentially higher-performing assets."
2024-08-16 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, reclaiming levels near $59,600 after a recent surge. However, the macroeconomic context remains mixed, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate VIX suggesting a balanced risk environment. Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, with low gas fees suggesting potential bullishness, but a rising-wedge pattern indicating possible downside risk. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana's technical indicators suggest caution due to its position below the lower Bollinger Band. USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news about price recovery support a bullish outlook. On-chain activity is low, but the overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, the significant drop in gas fees and potential for upward movement provide a cautiously optimistic view.

SOL: -0.1 — Lack of significant news and technical indicators suggesting a possible breakdown warrant a cautious approach, though no strong sell signal is present.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, there is no clear direction for Dogecoin, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in BTC and potential in ETH, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-08-16 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a strong price recovery and Ethereum benefiting from reduced gas fees, which historically signals potential bullish momentum. However, Ethereum's technical setup suggests caution due to a possible correction. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, showing mixed signals in their technical indicators. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility in the S&P 500 and a moderate U.S. dollar index, suggesting a neutral backdrop for risk assets. The stablecoin USDT remains a safe haven, but the current market conditions may encourage capital rotation into more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price recovery and bullish momentum indicators, combined with favorable news, suggest a positive outlook. Despite low mining profitability, the price surge indicates strong market interest.

ETH: +0.5 — While Ethereum's gas fees are at a 5-year low, signaling potential bullish momentum, caution is warranted due to the technical risk of a correction. However, the overall sentiment remains positive.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana shows no significant news and mixed technical signals, with no clear direction. The lack of a buy signal and potential breakdown suggests a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, Dogecoin lacks significant news and shows no strong technical signals, warranting a hold position.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of recovery and risk appetite potentially increasing, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to allocate capital to more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, reclaiming levels near $59,600 after a significant price surge. This is supported by bullish technical indicators and increased on-chain activity. Ethereum also exhibits a positive outlook with historically low gas fees, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks unless key resistance levels are breached. Solana and Dogecoin have shown price increases but lack significant news or bullish technical signals. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by positive price action and on-chain activity. The recent price surge and bullish technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite a potential downside risk highlighted by technical analysis, the significant drop in gas fees and overall bullish sentiment provide a moderately positive outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's recent price increase lacks strong technical or news support, leading to a neutral stance. The absence of significant developments keeps the allocation unchanged.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows increased transaction activity, but without significant news or technical signals, the allocation remains neutral.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of bullish momentum, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-08-16 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum and a significant price surge, despite challenges in mining profitability. Ethereum is experiencing a bullish outlook due to historically low gas fees, although there are technical warnings of potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news-driven changes, while Tether remains stable as expected. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and a moderate U.S. dollar index, suggesting a balanced risk appetite in the broader market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with a significant price surge and bullish technical indicators. Despite mining profitability concerns, the overall sentiment is positive, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's low gas fees and bullish momentum suggest potential upside, though caution is advised due to technical downside risks. A moderate increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's technical indicators are neutral, with no significant news or momentum to drive a change in allocation. Maintaining current exposure is appropriate.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some price increases, Dogecoin lacks strong technical or news-driven catalysts to justify a change in allocation. Holding current exposure is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive momentum in BTC and ETH, there is a slight shift away from stablecoins as risk appetite increases. Reducing USDT exposure to reallocate capital to more promising assets is advisable."
2024-08-16 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin leading the charge as it experiences a significant price surge, reclaiming levels near $59,600. This upward momentum is supported by strong technical indicators, despite challenges in mining profitability. Ethereum is also showing bullish signs, with gas fees at a five-year low, potentially signaling further upward movement. However, a technical pattern suggests caution due to possible downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have shown moderate price increases but lack significant news-driven catalysts. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady indices, which supports a risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite potential downside risks, the significant drop in gas fees and bullish momentum signal a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Solana remains neutral, suggesting a hold position.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, the lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest maintaining the current exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets aligns with a risk-on strategy."
2024-08-16 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, reclaiming levels near $59,600. Despite the positive price action, Bitcoin mining profitability is under pressure due to increased hashrate. Ethereum is experiencing a drop in gas fees, which historically precedes price increases, although there is a technical warning of a potential correction. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, but Solana's price has shown a slight increase. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with no significant changes in key indicators like the U.S. dollar index or S&P 500, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong price momentum and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward movement. The recent price surge and positive sentiment outweigh concerns about mining profitability.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite the potential technical correction, the significant drop in gas fees is historically bullish, and the overall momentum remains positive.

SOL: +0.2 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a cautious approach, but the slight price increase indicates some positive sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators. The recent price movements do not suggest a strong directional bias.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market showing bullish tendencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, driven by a significant price surge and positive technical indicators. Despite the recent increase, Bitcoin mining profitability has hit a low, which may impact long-term sentiment. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish signals with historically low gas fees, although there is a technical warning of a potential correction. Solana and Dogecoin have shown mixed signals with no significant news, while USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite the potential correction warning, the drop in gas fees and overall bullish sentiment support a moderately positive outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Solana remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows some bullish momentum, but without significant news or strong technical signals, it remains a hold.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in BTC and ETH, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-16 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, driven by a strong reversal from earlier lows, although mining profitability remains a concern. Ethereum's low gas fees suggest a potential bullish outlook, but technical patterns indicate possible downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, though Solana's technical indicators are not supportive of a bullish stance. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a relatively stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility, suggest a cautiously optimistic market environment, with potential for growth in risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong on-chain activity signal a bullish trend, despite concerns about mining profitability. The overall market sentiment supports further capital allocation into BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum's low gas fees are a bullish indicator, the potential downside risk from technical patterns warrants a cautious approach. However, the overall sentiment remains slightly positive.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators suggest a neutral stance. Solana's current market activity does not justify increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators result in a neutral position for Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — With a slight bullish sentiment in the market, there is a moderate preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."
2024-08-16 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing a recent price surge and maintaining bullish momentum despite a slight decrease in the last few hours. Ethereum is experiencing historically low gas fees, which could signal a bullish outlook, although technical patterns suggest potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news developments, and their technical indicators remain neutral to slightly bearish. The macroeconomic environment is stable, with low volatility and moderate interest rates, which may support risk-on sentiment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains relatively strong, which could cap upside potential in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent slight price decreases, Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and positive news regarding price recovery suggest a moderately bullish stance. The overall macro environment supports risk-on assets, but caution is warranted due to mining profitability concerns.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's low gas fees and bullish momentum indicators are positive, but the potential downside risk from the rising-wedge pattern tempers enthusiasm. The overall outlook remains cautiously optimistic.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral to slightly bearish technical indicators, Solana does not present a compelling case for allocation changes at this time.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's technical indicators are mixed, with low on-chain activity and no significant news. The asset remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the cautiously optimistic sentiment in the broader crypto market, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-17 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical post-halving patterns and election-year volatility. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with mixed signals from underperforming ETFs. Solana's prospects are dampened by regulatory delays in ETF approvals.

The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and historical patterns suggest potential for a rally. On-chain activity also supports positive sentiment.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $2,700, the overall bullish momentum and technical indicators remain positive, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — Regulatory setbacks and lack of bullish momentum suggest reducing exposure until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and a technical breakout above resistance indicate potential for further gains, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive signals across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential market rallies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX and a strong S&P 500 index. Bitcoin is showing bullish momentum with potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical halving-year patterns. Ethereum, while experiencing a recent rally, faces resistance and mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by regulatory delays in ETF approvals. Dogecoin is experiencing positive momentum with significant whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and on-chain activity, supported by potential Q4 rally patterns and historical election-year volatility.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum. However, ETF underperformance tempers enthusiasm, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of bullish signals and regulatory uncertainties surrounding ETF filings suggest a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from whale accumulation and technical breakthroughs suggest potential for further gains, making it an attractive short-term allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential upward movements in the crypto market."
2024-08-17 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical post-halving patterns and recent price movements. Ethereum, however, faces resistance around $2,700, with mixed news from the ETF market affecting sentiment. Solana is experiencing uncertainty due to the removal of ETF filings, which could delay U.S. approval and impact investor confidence. Dogecoin is seeing positive momentum due to significant whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance, suggesting potential for further gains. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable S&P 500 and low volatility index, suggest a relatively stable risk environment, which may support continued interest in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential for a Q4 rally as suggested by historical patterns. Positive sentiment from macroeconomic stability supports further upside.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the resistance around $2,700 and underwhelming ETF performance suggest a neutral stance is prudent until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.1 — The removal of ETF filings introduces uncertainty, and the lack of bullish technical signals suggests a cautious approach, though a negative score is only applicable if currently held.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and a breakthrough above resistance indicate potential for further price appreciation, supported by bullish technical indicators.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally optimistic market sentiment and potential for gains in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is favored to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-08-17 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.75. The crypto market is exhibiting mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally due to historical patterns and recent on-chain activity surges. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with underwhelming ETF performance affecting sentiment. Solana's ETF prospects have been delayed, introducing uncertainty. Dogecoin is experiencing positive momentum due to whale accumulation and breaking through resistance levels. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with historical patterns suggesting a potential Q4 rally. On-chain activity supports a positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces resistance and disappointing ETF performance, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.1 — Uncertainty from ETF filing delays and lack of strong technical signals suggest a cautious approach, but no reduction as it is currently held.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from whale accumulation and technical breakouts indicate potential for price appreciation.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in BTC and DOGE, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-17 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential rally patterns post-halving and some analysts drawing parallels to past election-year volatility. Ethereum is facing resistance at $2,700, with mixed signals from underperforming ETFs. Solana's outlook is clouded by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin is experiencing positive momentum due to increased whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough above short-term resistance. The macroeconomic backdrop is relatively stable, with low volatility and moderate interest rates, suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive news about potential Q4 rally patterns suggest increased allocation to Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish momentum, resistance at $2,700 and disappointing ETF performance warrant caution, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty surrounding ETF filings tempers enthusiasm, leading to a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive on-chain activity and whale accumulation indicate potential for further gains, justifying increased allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with bullish momentum signals across most cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin is showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price movements. Ethereum, while experiencing a short-term rally, faces resistance and bearish sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's market is affected by regulatory uncertainties following the removal of ETF filings. Dogecoin is experiencing positive momentum due to increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough of resistance levels. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential Q4 rally patterns make Bitcoin attractive, especially with its historical election-year volatility.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700 and negative sentiment from underperforming ETFs, suggesting a hold position.

SOL: -0.1 — Regulatory uncertainties from the removal of ETF filings introduce risk, though bullish momentum persists. Slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from whale accumulation and technical breakthroughs support a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets, reducing USDT exposure is appropriate to capitalize on potential upward movements in the crypto market."
2024-08-17 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential rally pattern post-halving, supported by historical trends and current bullish technical signals. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with recent ETF disappointments weighing on sentiment. Solana is experiencing uncertainty due to the removal of ETF filings, which could delay U.S. approval. Dogecoin is seeing positive momentum with increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above resistance levels. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady U.S. dollar index, suggesting a cautious but optimistic outlook for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and historical patterns suggest a potential rally, supported by positive macroeconomic conditions and on-chain activity.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish momentum, resistance at $2,700 and disappointing ETF performance suggest caution. Maintain exposure but be wary of potential downside.

SOL: 0.0 — Uncertainty from ETF filing removals offsets bullish momentum signals. Hold current position until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and recent resistance breakthrough indicate potential for further gains. Positive sentiment supports moderate capital allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT exposure in the portfolio."
2024-08-17 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows stability with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.75, and a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index at 102.27. The crypto market displays mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns post-halving and election-year volatility. Ethereum faces resistance around $2,700, with underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs contributing to a cautious outlook. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by the removal of ETF filings, introducing uncertainty. Dogecoin shows bullish potential with significant whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive momentum and historical patterns suggest potential for a Q4 rally. Strong technical indicators support a bullish outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, resistance at $2,700 and disappointing ETF performance suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.1 — Uncertainty due to ETF filing removals and lack of buy signals warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and recent resistance breakthrough indicate bullish potential, warranting increased allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure aligns with a risk-on sentiment."
2024-08-17 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and current technical indicators. Ethereum, while experiencing a recent rally, faces resistance and mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's market outlook is clouded by regulatory delays in the U.S., while Dogecoin is seeing positive accumulation trends, suggesting potential for price appreciation. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility and no significant shifts in major indices, which may support a gradual increase in risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and positive on-chain activity. The macroeconomic environment is stable, which may favor continued upward movement.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum. However, mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs tempers enthusiasm, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty with ETF filings creates a neutral outlook. Despite bullish momentum, the lack of a clear catalyst suggests holding current positions.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant whale accumulation and a breakthrough above resistance indicate potential for further gains, making it relatively attractive in the current market.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive signals in other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capture potential upside in riskier assets."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential rally patterns post-halving and aligning with historical election-year volatility. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700, with mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's market is clouded by regulatory uncertainty following the removal of ETF filings, while Dogecoin benefits from increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced approach to risk, suggesting a slight preference for risk assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin demonstrates strong upward momentum and potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent on-chain activity surge.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's recent rally and bullish momentum indicators suggest a cautious buy, tempered by ETF disappointment.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainty from ETF filing removals offsets bullish momentum, warranting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and technical breakthroughs indicate potential for further gains, making it an attractive short-term allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a slight increase in risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, reducing USDT exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally following historical halving-year patterns, despite recent volatility linked to macroeconomic events like the U.S. CPI data and upcoming elections. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with mixed signals from underperforming ETFs. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin is experiencing positive momentum due to increased whale accumulation and a recent breakthrough above short-term resistance. USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential Q4 rally and historical patterns suggest a positive outlook, supported by current bullish momentum and on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's bullish momentum and recent rally provide a modestly positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to ETF underperformance.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory delays in ETF approvals create uncertainty, offsetting the bullish momentum signals. A neutral stance is prudent until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a technical breakthrough suggest potential for further price appreciation, making it relatively attractive.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of USDT, though maintaining some exposure for stability is advisable."
2024-08-17 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate interest rates and a low volatility index, suggesting a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment for risk assets. Bitcoin shows potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent on-chain activity, despite some election-year volatility concerns. Ethereum faces resistance around $2,700, with mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by regulatory delays in ETF approvals. Dogecoin shows positive momentum with increased whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive historical patterns and strong on-chain activity suggest potential for a Q4 rally, making BTC attractive despite some volatility concerns.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing resistance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum. However, the underperformance of ETFs tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: -0.1 — Regulatory delays in ETF approvals create uncertainty, but bullish momentum persists. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and recent technical breakout indicate strong potential for further gains, warranting increased exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant news and a stable macro environment, USDT remains a neutral holding, serving as a liquidity reserve."
2024-08-17 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price action. However, the broader macroeconomic environment, including stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggests a mixed outlook. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700 and underwhelming ETF performance, indicating potential short-term bearishness. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin shows signs of bullish momentum with increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough of local resistance. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin exhibits strong technical indicators and historical patterns suggesting a potential rally, supported by increased on-chain activity and positive news sentiment.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces resistance and disappointing ETF performance, suggesting caution in increasing exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Regulatory uncertainties and lack of strong buy signals warrant a neutral stance, despite bullish momentum.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough of resistance levels indicate potential for further gains, making it relatively attractive.

USDT: -0.4 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-17 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a Q4 rally, despite some volatility linked to macroeconomic factors like the U.S. presidential election cycle. Ethereum is facing short-term resistance, and its ETF performance has been underwhelming, which may dampen enthusiasm. Solana's ETF prospects have been delayed, introducing uncertainty, while Dogecoin is experiencing a positive momentum with significant whale accumulation and a recent price breakout. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable indicators, suggests a balanced approach, with some caution due to potential volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing potential for a rally, supported by historical patterns and on-chain activity. The macroeconomic context is stable, and the market seems cautiously optimistic.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance and disappointing ETF performance, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum. However, caution is warranted due to potential bearish continuation.

SOL: 0.0 — The uncertainty around ETF filings and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance. While there is bullish momentum, the lack of clear catalysts warrants caution.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from whale accumulation and a technical breakout above resistance indicate potential for further gains, making it relatively attractive.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and DOGE."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of potential upward momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing positive technical indicators and historical patterns suggesting a possible Q4 rally, although it faces volatility linked to macroeconomic events like the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum has shown some resistance around the $2,700 mark, with mixed news from the ETF market dampening enthusiasm. Solana's momentum is somewhat hindered by regulatory uncertainties surrounding ETF filings, while Dogecoin is buoyed by significant whale accumulation and a recent technical breakout. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option but lacks the upward potential seen in other assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive historical patterns and technical indicators suggest potential for a Q4 rally, despite macroeconomic volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite resistance at $2,700, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and could benefit from broader market optimism.

SOL: +0.2 — While regulatory hurdles exist, Solana's technical indicators are positive, suggesting potential for growth.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant whale accumulation and a technical breakout above resistance indicate strong upward potential.

USDT: -0.5 — In a market showing signs of bullishness, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with growth potential."
2024-08-17 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a cautiously optimistic sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum displaying potential for upward movement despite some resistance. Bitcoin is drawing attention due to historical patterns suggesting a possible Q4 rally, while Ethereum faces short-term resistance but maintains bullish momentum. Solana's market sentiment is dampened by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin benefits from significant whale accumulation and technical breakouts. The macroeconomic backdrop, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on approach, though the U.S. dollar's strength may temper aggressive bullishness.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Historical patterns and recent activity suggest potential for a Q4 rally, though caution is warranted due to election-year volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite facing resistance, Ethereum's technical indicators remain bullish, and the current price level offers a reasonable entry point for potential gains.

SOL: 0.0 — While technicals are positive, regulatory uncertainty around ETF approvals creates a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and technical breakouts above resistance levels provide strong bullish signals, warranting increased exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall positive sentiment and potential for gains in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings to capitalize on risk assets is advisable."
2024-08-17 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical signals and positive news developments. Bitcoin is experiencing potential rally patterns post-halving, with analysts suggesting a possible Q4 rally, although election-year volatility could introduce choppy movements. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with underperforming Ether ETFs dampening enthusiasm. Solana's market sentiment is affected by the removal of ETF filings, introducing uncertainty. Dogecoin is experiencing increased whale accumulation, suggesting reduced sell pressure and potential for price gains. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a cautiously bullish outlook, though the U.S. Dollar Index remains relatively strong, which could temper risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with potential Q4 rally patterns and bullish technical signals. The macroeconomic environment and historical patterns support a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite facing resistance at $2,700, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and on-chain activity, though enthusiasm is tempered by underperforming ETFs.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana shows bullish technical signals, the removal of ETF filings introduces uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above resistance suggest potential for further gains, supported by bullish technical signals.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive sentiment and technical signals across other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-17 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable outlook with moderate volatility (VIX at 14.75) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin's market data indicates mixed signals, with potential for a Q4 rally as suggested by historical patterns, although recent price movements have been choppy. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with underwhelming ETF performance dampening enthusiasm. Solana's ETF-related news introduces uncertainty, while Dogecoin shows signs of strength with increased whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent choppy movements, historical patterns and potential Q4 rally suggest a moderate buy signal. On-chain activity is robust, supporting a positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Technical resistance and disappointing ETF performance balance out the bullish momentum, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — While ETF uncertainty is a concern, strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum provide a slight positive bias.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance indicate potential for further gains, warranting a modest buy signal.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall risk-on sentiment and potential for gains in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on market opportunities."
2024-08-17 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential rally pattern post-halving, supported by historical trends and current technical indicators, despite some volatility linked to macroeconomic events like the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum is facing resistance at $2,700, with mixed signals from recent ETF performance. Solana's market outlook is clouded by regulatory uncertainties following the removal of ETF filings, while Dogecoin is seeing increased whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance, indicating potential upward movement. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with historical patterns suggesting a potential rally. The technical indicators and on-chain activity support a bullish outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical signals, Ethereum faces resistance and mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Although technical indicators are positive, regulatory uncertainties regarding ETF filings introduce caution, justifying a modest positive score.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a technical breakout suggest potential for further gains, supporting a moderately bullish allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, it is prudent to reduce stablecoin exposure to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-08-17 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin shows potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and recent price movements, despite some volatility linked to macroeconomic factors like the U.S. presidential election. Ethereum faces resistance near $2,700, with underwhelming performance from Ether ETFs dampening enthusiasm. Solana's market outlook is clouded by regulatory delays in ETF approvals, while Dogecoin benefits from significant whale accumulation and a recent technical breakout. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and potential for a Q4 rally suggest a positive outlook. However, election-year volatility warrants some caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $2,700 and disappointing ETF performance, bullish momentum and technical signals support a modest positive stance.

SOL: +0.1 — While technical indicators are positive, regulatory uncertainty regarding ETF filings tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and a technical breakout above resistance indicate potential for further gains, warranting increased exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintaining a neutral stance as the market shows a cautious bullish trend, keeping USDT as a hedge against potential volatility."
2024-08-17 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 performance. Bitcoin is experiencing potential bullish sentiment due to historical patterns post-halving and election-year volatility, suggesting a possible rally in Q4. Ethereum faces resistance at $2,700 despite recent gains, with Ether ETFs underperforming market expectations, leading to mixed sentiment. Solana's ETF filings removal introduces uncertainty, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm. Dogecoin shows positive signs with significant whale accumulation and a breakthrough above short-term resistance, indicating potential upward movement. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Historical patterns and potential Q4 rally provide a bullish outlook, supported by stable on-chain activity and macroeconomic conditions.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite resistance at $2,700, bullish momentum and on-chain activity suggest potential for gains, though tempered by ETF underperformance.

SOL: 0.0 — Uncertainty from ETF filing removal offsets positive on-chain activity, resulting in a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and recent resistance breakthrough indicate potential for further price appreciation, warranting increased exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment suggests a stable yet cautious market sentiment. The U.S. dollar remains strong, and volatility is relatively low, which can support risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical post-halving patterns and election-year volatility. Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,700, with mixed sentiment due to underperforming ETFs. Solana's momentum is hindered by regulatory delays in ETF approvals. Dogecoin is experiencing positive sentiment due to increased whale accumulation and a recent breakout above resistance. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows potential for a Q4 rally, supported by historical patterns and increased on-chain activity. Despite recent price fluctuations, the overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum faces resistance and mixed sentiment due to ETF performance, but maintains bullish momentum. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory delays in ETF approvals, Solana's technical indicators remain strong, and on-chain activity is surging, supporting a moderate positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased whale accumulation and a successful breakout above resistance suggest potential for further gains, warranting a higher allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable market conditions, USDT remains a neutral hold, serving as a liquidity buffer in the portfolio."
2024-08-18 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators and on-chain activity. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakout, supported by increased transaction activity, although its dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed signals with whale sell-offs despite bullish momentum indicators, suggesting short-term caution. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes, but the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure. Dogecoin is seeing increased activity, which might signal a potential rally. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators with a potential breakout and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite whale sell-offs, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and technical support, though caution is warranted due to potential short-term volatility.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's strong DEX volume share and positive technical indicators are promising, but the upcoming token unlock could introduce price pressure.

DOGE: +0.4 — The surge in active addresses and bullish momentum suggest potential for a price rally, warranting increased allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant changes or news, USDT remains a neutral holding, serving as a stable option amidst market fluctuations."
2024-08-18 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic indicators suggest a stable environment, with low volatility (VIX at 14.7) and a relatively strong S&P 500 index, which may support risk-on sentiment. However, Ethereum faces some short-term risks due to significant whale sell-offs, and Solana could experience price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. The U.S. Dollar Index remains stable, and there is no significant news affecting Tether, indicating a neutral stance for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a strong momentum signal, BTC's price is stable with a buy trend signal and increased on-chain activity, suggesting moderate confidence in continued strength.

ETH: 0.0 — While technical indicators are positive, recent whale sell-offs introduce uncertainty, balancing out the bullish sentiment from potential ETF optimism.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX volume share and positive technical indicators are slightly offset by the upcoming token unlock, warranting cautious optimism.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses and bullish momentum signal potential for a price rally, though recent price decreases suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant changes in macroeconomic conditions or market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as a hedge against volatility."
2024-08-18 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with several assets showing upward momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price increase and shows strong buy signals, although its market dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum is experiencing mixed signals with large holders selling off despite positive price movement, suggesting short-term caution. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes, but a significant token unlock could pressure its price. Dogecoin is seeing increased activity, potentially signaling a breakout. With no significant news for Tether, it remains a stable option amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with a significant price increase and positive on-chain activity, making it attractive for capital allocation despite dominance concerns.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from whale sell-offs and ETF optimism create uncertainty, suggesting a hold position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — High DEX volume share and positive price movement are promising, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk, warranting cautious optimism.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses and recent price gains suggest potential for further upward movement, supporting a modest allocation increase.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of bullishness, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a volatile period with fluctuating prices and an increase in on-chain activity, but lacks a clear bullish momentum. Ethereum faces short-term risks with large sell-offs by whales, despite some optimism around ETF developments. Solana shows strong on-chain activity and significant DEX volume, but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin has seen a notable increase in active addresses, suggesting potential for a price rally. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, indicates a relatively calm broader financial environment, which could support risk-on behavior in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of strong bullish momentum, Bitcoin's price resilience and increased on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal, especially given its foundational role in the portfolio.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals from whale sell-offs and ETF optimism create uncertainty. Holding current levels seems prudent until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX activity and price momentum are positive, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

DOGE: +0.1 — The surge in active addresses hints at potential price gains, but without strong technical signals, a small positive allocation is appropriate.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally stable macroeconomic environment and some positive signals in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings to rotate capital into more volatile assets is advisable."
2024-08-18 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows relatively stable conditions with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.7. The S&P 500 remains strong, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin shows mixed signals with strong on-chain activity but lacks consistent bullish momentum. Ethereum is experiencing some sell pressure from large holders despite its technical indicators suggesting bullish momentum. Solana is gaining significant traction in decentralized exchange volumes, but the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure. Dogecoin is seeing an increase in active addresses, which could signal potential upward movement. There is no significant news for Tether, and it remains a stable option amidst these dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite mixed momentum signals, Bitcoin's strong on-chain activity and overall market cap dominance suggest a cautious buy.

ETH: 0.0 — The sell-off by whales introduces short-term risk, counterbalancing the technical buy signals, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana's DEX volume share is impressive, the upcoming token unlock poses a risk, warranting a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.1 — The increase in active addresses hints at potential upward movement, but the lack of strong momentum keeps the signal modest.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally positive risk sentiment in the market, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-08-18 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin has demonstrated a significant price increase and bullish technical indicators, although its market dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to large sell-offs by whales, despite positive ETF prospects. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin shows increased activity, which could indicate a potential breakout. In this environment, risk appetite seems to be increasing, which might lead to a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and bullish technical indicators suggest further potential gains. Market dominance concerns are noted but do not outweigh current bullish signals.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent sell-offs by whales, the potential for ETF approval provides a positive outlook. Technical indicators remain generally supportive.

SOL: +0.5 — High DEX volume share and bullish momentum are positive, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk. Current signals favor a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased active addresses and slight price uptick suggest potential for further gains. However, the lack of strong technical signals warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets. Current market conditions support reducing exposure to USDT."
2024-08-18 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 14.7. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin shows a consistent buy signal in trend indicators, though it lacks strong momentum. Ethereum faces short-term risks due to whale sell-offs, despite some optimism around ETFs. Solana is gaining traction in the DEX space but faces potential downward pressure from a significant token unlock. Dogecoin shows increased on-chain activity, which could precede a price rally. USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of strong momentum, Bitcoin's consistent buy signal and stable macro environment support a moderate increase in allocation. The skepticism around Bitcoin's dominance doesn't immediately impact its short-term trading potential.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risks, overshadowing any ETF optimism. The technical indicators are neutral, suggesting caution.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's strong DEX volume share is a positive sign, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk. The bullish momentum and trend signals justify a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally. While technical indicators are neutral, the on-chain activity supports a slight positive bias.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant changes in market conditions or news, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, especially as it serves as a stable reserve in the portfolio."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin maintains a steady upward trend, supported by strong on-chain activity, though its dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed signals with significant whale sell-offs, indicating potential short-term risks despite ETF optimism. Solana shows robust activity in decentralized exchanges, but the impending token unlock could exert downward pressure. Dogecoin's surge in active addresses suggests potential for a breakout, while Tether remains stable with no significant news. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady S&P 500, suggesting a moderate risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and strong on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook, though dominance concerns temper enthusiasm.

ETH: -0.3 — Whale sell-offs and mixed technical signals indicate caution, despite long-term optimism around ETFs.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX activity supports a positive outlook, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses hint at a potential breakout, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a moderate risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate."
2024-08-18 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators, such as buy signals from short-term moving averages. Bitcoin remains stable with a slight upward trend, although its dominance is not expected to significantly increase. Ethereum faces some short-term selling pressure from large holders, despite positive developments like ETF optimism. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes, but an upcoming token unlock could introduce volatility. Dogecoin shows potential for a breakout with a significant increase in active addresses. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady indices, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin maintains a stable upward trend with consistent buy signals, though its dominance is capped. It remains a solid component of the portfolio.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum shows mixed signals with recent whale sell-offs countering positive ETF news. Holding current positions is prudent until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's strong DEX volume share and bullish momentum are promising, but the upcoming token unlock warrants caution. A moderate increase is justified.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally. A slight increase in allocation is reasonable given the positive on-chain activity.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly to reallocate capital into more promising assets is advisable."
2024-08-18 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing increased on-chain activity and a positive price trend, although its dominance may be capped. Ethereum has seen significant whale sell-offs, creating mixed sentiment despite price gains. Solana is showing strong decentralized exchange activity, but upcoming token unlocks could pressure its price. Dogecoin is witnessing a surge in active addresses, suggesting potential for a breakout. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with no significant volatility, which supports a moderate risk-on approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows strong price momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a favorable environment for continued gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, the large whale sell-off introduces uncertainty, balancing bullish and bearish pressures.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX activity and bullish momentum are positive, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses indicates potential for a price rally, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-18 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity, although its dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs despite ETF optimism. Solana is gaining traction with a significant share of DEX volumes, although upcoming token unlocks may exert downward pressure. Dogecoin shows potential for a breakout with a surge in active addresses, indicating increased interest. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with no significant changes in indicators like the U.S. Dollar Index or volatility, suggesting a neutral backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signal supported by bullish momentum, increased on-chain activity, and a stable macroeconomic environment. Despite capped dominance, Bitcoin remains attractive.

ETH: -0.1 — Mixed signals due to whale sell-offs and volatility concerns, though ETF optimism provides some support. Cautious stance warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from high DEX volume share and bullish momentum, though upcoming token unlocks require vigilance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased active addresses and bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — Neutral stance as there is no significant news or shifts in macroeconomic conditions to drive a move into or out of stablecoins."
2024-08-18 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies exhibiting bullish technical indicators and momentum signals. Bitcoin maintains a strong buy signal with consistent on-chain activity, although its market dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum is experiencing mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs despite positive price movements and ETF optimism. Solana shows strong technical indicators and significant DEX volume share, but potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks could be a concern. Dogecoin is seeing increased activity, suggesting potential for a breakout. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with no significant changes in traditional financial indicators, which supports a moderate risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Consistent bullish momentum and strong on-chain activity suggest continued upward potential, despite dominance concerns.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are positive, recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risk, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and significant DEX volume share support a positive outlook, though upcoming token unlocks should be monitored.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses and bullish momentum indicate potential for further gains, though the risk remains moderate.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-08-18 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with positive technical indicators and momentum signals for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin maintains strong on-chain activity, though its dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to whale sell-offs, despite positive technical signals. Solana is experiencing significant decentralized exchange activity, but the upcoming token unlock could pressure prices. Dogecoin shows increased active addresses, suggesting potential for a price rally. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and no significant changes in traditional financial indicators, which supports a moderate risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's technical indicators and on-chain activity are supportive, though market dominance concerns limit the score. 

ETH: +0.3 — Despite whale sell-offs, Ethereum's technical indicators remain strong, but caution is warranted due to potential short-term risks.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DEX activity and positive technical signals are favorable, though the upcoming token unlock requires monitoring.

DOGE: +0.4 — Increased active addresses and positive momentum suggest potential for further price appreciation.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-08-18 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most major cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators and positive momentum signals. Bitcoin maintains a strong buy signal with consistent upward momentum and increased on-chain activity, although its dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs, despite technical indicators remaining positive. Solana shows strong decentralized exchange activity, but the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure on its price. Dogecoin is experiencing a surge in active addresses, which could signal a potential breakout. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady S&P 500, suggesting a moderate risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals and bullish momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity, make BTC attractive, though dominance concerns warrant a slightly cautious approach.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish technicals, the recent whale sell-off introduces short-term risk, suggesting a cautious stance until volatility subsides.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive DEX activity supports a bullish outlook, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk, warranting a moderate allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses indicates potential for a breakout, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals across other assets, there is a reduced need for stablecoin exposure, suggesting a rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-08-18 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin's dominance is expected to remain capped, while Ethereum faces short-term risks due to significant whale sell-offs. Solana is gaining traction in the decentralized exchange space, although upcoming token unlocks could pressure its price. Dogecoin is seeing a notable increase in active addresses, suggesting potential for a price rally. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility and a steady S&P 500, which might encourage risk-taking in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite capped dominance, Bitcoin maintains strong technical indicators and bullish momentum, making it a relatively safe allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risks, although overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX volume share supports Solana's bullish case, but upcoming token unlocks warrant a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses hint at potential upward movement, although the overall market impact remains uncertain.

USDT: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in market conditions suggest maintaining current exposure for liquidity purposes."
2024-08-18 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 14.7. The crypto market shows mixed signals: while technical indicators for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE generally suggest bullish momentum, recent price declines and on-chain activity indicate caution. Bitcoin's dominance is expected to remain capped, while Ethereum faces short-term selling pressure from whales. Solana is gaining traction in decentralized exchange volumes but faces potential price pressure from an upcoming token unlock. Dogecoin shows increased activity, hinting at potential upward movement. The stablecoin USDT remains a safe haven, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, BTC maintains a buy signal from trend indicators and has bullish momentum. However, low on-chain activity suggests caution.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technicals are strong, but recent whale sell-offs introduce uncertainty. The market is waiting for clearer signals regarding ETF developments.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's strong DEX volume share is positive, but the upcoming token unlock could pressure prices. The current technicals support a cautious buy.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a price rally, but recent price declines and low on-chain activity warrant a conservative approach.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable market conditions, USDT remains a neutral holding, serving as a buffer against volatility in other assets."
2024-08-18 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish technical indicators and some cautionary news. Bitcoin shows strong technical signals, though its market dominance is expected to be capped. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment due to significant whale sell-offs despite positive ETF news. Solana is showing robust activity in decentralized exchanges but faces potential price pressure from an upcoming token unlock.

The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, supports a moderate risk appetite, though the U.S. dollar index remains relatively strong.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite capped dominance, strong technical indicators and stable macroeconomic conditions support a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risk, offsetting bullish technicals and ETF optimism.

SOL: +0.3 — High DEX activity and positive technicals are promising, but the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses suggest potential for a breakout, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant news and a stable macro environment, maintaining current exposure to USDT is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing stable price movements with no significant bullish momentum, while Ethereum faces short-term selling pressure from whales despite ongoing ETF optimism. Solana shows strong activity in decentralized exchanges but faces potential downward pressure due to a large token unlock. Dogecoin is seeing increased activity, which could signal a potential breakout. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and no major disruptions in traditional markets, suggesting a cautious but slightly optimistic outlook for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a lack of strong momentum signals, Bitcoin's stable price and market dominance suggest a moderate buy opportunity, especially given the overall market's slight bullish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — The recent sell-off by whales introduces short-term risk, balancing out the positive ETF sentiment. Holding current positions seems prudent until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana's strong DEX activity is a positive sign, the upcoming token unlock poses a potential risk. A cautious increase in exposure is warranted, but with vigilance on the unlock event.

DOGE: +0.5 — The significant increase in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally. Given the current market sentiment, this presents a relatively attractive opportunity for capital allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — With a slight bullish sentiment in the crypto market, reducing stablecoin holdings to reallocate into more volatile assets seems appropriate, though maintaining some exposure for risk management is advisable."
2024-08-18 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment indicates a stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as reflected by the VIX at 14.7. The crypto market is showing mixed signals, with Bitcoin maintaining a buy trend but lacking strong momentum. Ethereum is experiencing a sell-off by large holders, despite bullish technical indicators. Solana is gaining significant traction in decentralized exchange volumes, but faces potential price pressure from an upcoming token unlock. Dogecoin's active addresses have surged, suggesting potential for a price rally, although its technical indicators are not yet supportive. Tether remains stable without significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a lack of strong momentum, Bitcoin's buy trend and stable macro environment support a modest positive outlook. The absence of significant negative news suggests a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — The recent whale sell-off introduces short-term risks, despite positive technical indicators. The mixed sentiment warrants a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DEX volume share and bullish momentum suggest a favorable outlook, although the upcoming token unlock requires monitoring. Overall, Solana appears attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses hints at potential price movement, but technical indicators remain neutral. A cautious increase in exposure is justified given the potential for a breakout.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed signals across the market, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, allowing flexibility to adjust allocations as clearer trends emerge."
2024-08-18 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 14.7. The crypto market shows mixed signals, with some assets experiencing slight price increases and others seeing declines. Bitcoin's dominance is expected to remain capped, while Ethereum faces short-term risks due to significant whale sell-offs. Solana shows strong decentralized exchange activity but faces potential price pressure from upcoming token unlocks. Dogecoin has seen a notable increase in active addresses, which could signal a potential breakout. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some assets showing bullish signals while others are more neutral or bearish.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a buy signal from the trend indicators, Bitcoin's overall momentum is lacking, and market dominance is expected to remain capped. Neutral sentiment prevails.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent whale sell-offs and mixed technical indicators suggest caution. The potential for short-term volatility outweighs the ETF optimism.

SOL: +0.3 — Strong DEX activity is a positive sign, but the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure on the price. Moderate bullish sentiment.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses suggests potential for a breakout, but technical indicators remain weak. Slightly positive outlook.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed signals across other assets, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent to hedge against potential volatility."
2024-08-18 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX at 14.7. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 102.08, suggesting a moderate strength in the dollar, which could impact crypto prices. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows mixed signals with a lack of strong momentum, while Ethereum faces short-term selling pressure despite ETF optimism.

Dogecoin has seen a notable increase in active addresses, hinting at potential upward movement. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of strong momentum, Bitcoin's dominance and stability in the current market environment make it a relatively safe allocation, especially with macro stability.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent whale sell-offs introduce short-term risks, and while there's optimism around ETFs, the immediate sentiment is mixed.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX activity is a positive sign, but the upcoming token unlock could exert downward pressure, warranting a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.1 — The surge in active addresses suggests potential for a breakout, but given its volatility, a moderate allocation is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of mixed signals across other assets and potential volatility, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer and flexibility for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of technical signals and news-driven factors influencing asset prices. Bitcoin is experiencing some downward pressure with a recent significant price drop and no strong buy signals, while Ethereum faces short-term risks due to whale sell-offs despite ongoing ETF optimism. Solana shows strong decentralized exchange activity, but an upcoming token unlock could pressure prices. Dogecoin's increase in active addresses suggests potential for a price rally, though recent price declines indicate uncertainty. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price breakdown and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Maintain some exposure but reduce slightly due to potential downside risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale sell-offs and ETF optimism. Hold current position as the market digests these factors.

SOL: +0.2 — Strong DEX activity is a positive sign, but the upcoming token unlock poses a risk. Slightly increase exposure to capture potential upside.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased active addresses hint at a possible rally, but recent price declines warrant a cautious approach. Slightly increase exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market volatility and mixed signals across other assets, increasing stablecoin holdings provides a buffer against potential downturns."
2024-08-19 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX and a moderate U.S. Dollar Index. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin is under pressure despite some optimism around potential Fed rate cuts, as a significant portion of its supply remains dormant. Ethereum is facing headwinds from substantial ETF outflows, while Solana is dealing with record outflows from investment products. Dogecoin shows increased network activity, but its price remains stagnant. Tether continues to expand its presence, launching on the Aptos blockchain and leading in DeFi revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price decline and lack of bullish technical signals, the potential for a Fed rate cut and a large portion of BTC supply being dormant suggest underlying bullish sentiment. However, caution is warranted due to the current price breakdown.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh heavily on Ethereum, despite a consistent buy signal from the trend. The overall sentiment remains bearish.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana faces record outflows, the introduction of new DeFi use cases provides a counterbalance. The technical signals are mixed, suggesting a hold position.

DOGE: +0.1 — The surge in active addresses indicates strong network engagement, but the lack of bullish technical signals and price breakdown suggest only a slight positive bias.

USDT: +0.5 — With the current bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT provides stability. Its expansion on the Aptos blockchain and strong DeFi revenue further support its attractiveness as a safe haven."
2024-08-19 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some positive macroeconomic signals such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts boosting optimism in the crypto markets. However, there are significant outflows from major assets like Ethereum and Solana, indicating investor caution. Bitcoin shows signs of resilience with a large portion of its supply remaining dormant, suggesting long-term bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, Dogecoin's network engagement is increasing despite stagnant prices, and Tether continues to expand its utility and revenue generation, reflecting its stable demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price volatility, the long-term holding pattern and potential macroeconomic tailwinds provide a positive outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and institutional demand concerns weigh on sentiment, suggesting caution.

SOL: -0.2 — Record outflows from Solana products and lack of immediate bullish catalysts suggest a cautious stance.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement offers a slight positive, but price action remains relatively flat.

USDT: +0.3 — In the current mixed market environment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2024-08-19 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve boosting confidence in crypto markets. However, mixed signals persist across different assets. Bitcoin shows signs of bullish sentiment with a significant portion of its supply remaining dormant, indicating long-term holding by investors. Ethereum faces pressure from ETF outflows, while Solana experiences significant investment outflows, possibly due to reduced interest in meme-coin trading. Dogecoin sees increased network activity, suggesting strong community engagement despite stagnant prices. Tether continues to expand its presence in the DeFi space, maintaining its role as a stable asset amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, the potential for rate cuts and strong long-term holding patterns suggest a positive outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh on sentiment, though technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: 0.0 — Significant outflows from investment products offset by expanding DeFi use cases, resulting in a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses indicate strong network engagement, providing a slight positive signal.

USDT: +0.3 — In a mixed market environment, maintaining a stable position in USDT is prudent to manage volatility and potential capital rotation."

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some optimism driven by potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could positively impact crypto markets. However, there are significant outflows from ETH and SOL investment products, indicating caution among investors. BTC shows strong holding patterns, suggesting long-term bullish sentiment despite short-term technical weaknesses. DOGE has seen a notable increase in active addresses, indicating strong network engagement, while USDT continues to expand its presence in the DeFi space with new blockchain integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite short-term technical weaknesses, the long-term holding pattern and potential rate cut optimism provide a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.2 — Significant ETF outflows and mixed technical signals suggest caution, though long-term prospects remain intact.

SOL: -0.1 — Record outflows from Solana products and lack of strong technical signals warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased network activity is positive, but without strong price momentum, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and flexibility in the portfolio."
2024-08-19 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with traders anticipating potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could bolster crypto markets. Bitcoin shows signs of bullish sentiment with a significant portion of its supply remaining dormant, indicating long-term holding by investors. However, Ethereum faces headwinds from substantial ETF outflows, reflecting broader sentiment challenges. Solana has experienced significant outflows from investment products, though its DeFi use cases are expanding. Dogecoin's network engagement is strong despite stagnant prices, while Tether remains robust, launching on new blockchains and leading in DeFi revenue.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite technical indicators not showing strong buy signals, the anticipation of Fed rate cuts and the long-term holding pattern suggest bullish sentiment, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant ETF outflows and mixed sentiment from institutional investors suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent given the current market dynamics.

SOL: 0.0 — The large outflow from Solana products is concerning, but the expansion of DeFi use cases provides some balance. A neutral stance is appropriate until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in active addresses indicates strong network engagement, which could translate into future price movements. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

USDT: +0.1 — While typically a safe haven, the current market conditions and Tether's strong performance in DeFi suggest maintaining a slightly higher allocation for stability amidst market uncertainties."
2024-08-19 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mix of stability and caution, with relatively low volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a stable U.S. Dollar Index. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin shows resilience with a significant portion of its supply being dormant, suggesting strong holding sentiment despite no clear technical buy signals. Ethereum faces pressure from ETF outflows, impacting its price negatively. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, though its DeFi ecosystem is expanding. Dogecoin sees increased network engagement, but this hasn't translated into price momentum. Tether remains strong, with new blockchain integrations and leading DeFi revenue generation, indicating its continued importance as a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite lack of technical buy signals, strong holding sentiment and potential rate cut optimism provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh on Ethereum, suggesting a cautious stance despite its foundational role in DeFi.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant outflows from investment products overshadow positive developments in DeFi use cases, indicating potential short-term caution.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network engagement is a positive sign, but lack of price momentum and technical signals suggest only a slight positive bias.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a stablecoin position provides a buffer against volatility, especially with Tether's strong DeFi performance."
2024-08-19 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin is experiencing a mix of optimism due to potential Fed rate cuts and strong holding patterns, though technical indicators remain neutral. Ethereum faces pressure from significant ETF outflows and a lack of bullish technical signals. Solana is seeing substantial outflows from investment products, but its DeFi ecosystem is expanding. Dogecoin shows increased network activity, indicating strong community engagement despite stagnant prices. Tether remains strong with new blockchain integrations and high DeFi revenue, suggesting its continued utility in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite neutral technical indicators, the potential for Fed rate cuts and strong holding patterns provide a positive outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and lack of bullish signals suggest caution, though Ethereum's long-term potential remains intact.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana's DeFi use cases are expanding, the large outflows from investment products warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network activity and strong community engagement provide a slight positive bias, though price remains stagnant.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market conditions, maintaining a moderate level of USDT is prudent for liquidity and risk management."
2024-08-19 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve boosting optimism for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. However, Ethereum and Solana are experiencing significant outflows from investment products, indicating bearish sentiment and reduced institutional interest. Dogecoin shows increased network activity despite stagnant prices, suggesting underlying community engagement. Tether remains stable, with new developments on the Aptos blockchain and strong DeFi revenue performance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for rate cuts is creating upward pressure, and the high percentage of dormant BTC supply suggests strong holding sentiment.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand are weighing on Ethereum, despite no major technical changes.

SOL: -0.2 — Record outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, although new DeFi use cases could provide future support.

DOGE: 0.0 — Increased active addresses suggest strong engagement, but price stagnation and lack of significant news keep the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.2 — While generally stable, the current macroeconomic uncertainty and crypto market volatility warrant maintaining a moderate allocation in stablecoins for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of resilience amid hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite a lack of strong technical buy signals, Bitcoin's long-term holders and on-chain activity suggest a bullish sentiment. Ethereum faces challenges due to significant ETF outflows and reduced institutional demand, which weigh on its price. Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, though new DeFi applications could provide future support. Dogecoin shows strong network engagement despite stagnant prices, indicating potential underlying interest. Tether remains stable, with its expansion onto new blockchains and strong DeFi revenue highlighting its utility in the crypto ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of short-term technical buy signals, the long-term holding pattern and positive news regarding potential Fed rate cuts support a moderately bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and reduced institutional demand create a bearish sentiment, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from investment products overshadow the potential benefits of new DeFi use cases, suggesting a need to reduce exposure slightly.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and active addresses provide a positive signal, though price action remains stagnant.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential for volatility, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-08-19 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.65. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience with a significant portion of its supply being held dormant, indicating bullish sentiment among long-term holders. Ethereum is facing pressure from significant ETF outflows, which is weighing on its price. Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, but new DeFi use cases might provide long-term support. Dogecoin's network activity is increasing, suggesting strong community engagement despite price stagnation. Tether remains strong, with new blockchain integrations and leading DeFi revenue, indicating its continued dominance as a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of short-term technical buy signals, the long-term holding pattern and potential rate cuts by the Fed support a moderately bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant ETF outflows and recent price drop suggest caution, although long-term prospects remain positive.

SOL: -0.2 — The large outflows from Solana products are concerning, but the introduction of new DeFi applications provides some balance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network activity and community engagement are positive signs, though price momentum is lacking.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and flexibility to capitalize on future opportunities."
2024-08-19 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish indicators for Bitcoin due to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant portion of BTC supply remaining dormant, suggesting long-term holding. However, Ethereum faces negative pressure from substantial ETF outflows and institutional demand concerns. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, although it is expanding its DeFi use cases. Dogecoin shows increased network engagement despite stagnant prices, while Tether continues to expand its presence and revenue in the DeFi space. Overall, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with no significant changes in interest rates or volatility, but the crypto market is experiencing varied sentiment across different assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, the potential for rate cuts and strong long-term holding sentiment provide a moderately positive outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh heavily on Ethereum, suggesting a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.2 — Large outflows from Solana products indicate bearish sentiment, though the expansion in DeFi use cases provides some support.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and active addresses suggest a slight positive sentiment, though price action remains stagnant.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment in the broader crypto market, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a hedge against volatility and potential downturns in other assets."
2024-08-19 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential rebound pressure due to anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, technical indicators remain mixed, with no clear bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum faces headwinds from significant ETF outflows, which have weighed on its price, while Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, although its DeFi ecosystem is expanding. Dogecoin's network engagement is strong, as evidenced by a surge in active addresses, but price movement remains stagnant. Tether continues to show strength, with high revenue generation and expansion onto new blockchains, indicating its robust position in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While technical indicators are not yet bullish, the potential for a rebound driven by macroeconomic factors and strong on-chain holding sentiment suggests moderate upside potential.

ETH: -0.2 — Continued pressure from ETF outflows and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a cautious approach, despite some positive news from key figures in the ecosystem.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the negative sentiment from investment outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases provide a neutral outlook, balancing risks and opportunities.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement through active addresses suggests potential for future price movement, although current technicals remain neutral.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets and the strong performance in DeFi, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a stable hedge against volatility."
2024-08-19 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed picture for crypto assets. While there is optimism around potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could benefit risk assets like cryptocurrencies, the broader market sentiment remains cautious. Bitcoin shows signs of resilience with a significant portion of its supply being held long-term, indicating bullish sentiment. Ethereum faces headwinds from substantial ETF outflows, contributing to its recent price weakness. Solana is experiencing notable outflows from investment products, though its DeFi ecosystem continues to expand. Dogecoin sees increased network activity, suggesting a strong community presence despite stagnant prices. Tether remains a stable option, with its expansion into new blockchains and strong DeFi revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the long-term holding pattern and potential macroeconomic tailwinds from rate cut expectations support a moderately positive outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand weigh on sentiment, suggesting a cautious stance is warranted.

SOL: 0.0 — The significant outflows from Solana products are offset by expanding DeFi use cases, resulting in a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and active addresses provide a slight positive bias, although price action remains relatively flat.

USDT: +0.1 — While generally a safe haven, the current market conditions and Tether's strong performance in DeFi suggest maintaining a modest allocation for stability."
2024-08-19 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a rebound due to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could boost crypto markets. However, Ethereum faces headwinds from significant ETF outflows, contributing to a bearish sentiment. Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, although its DeFi use cases are expanding. Dogecoin is seeing increased network engagement despite stagnant prices, indicating strong community interest. Tether remains a stronghold with its expansion onto new blockchains and leading DeFi revenue generation, suggesting a stable demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts and strong on-chain holding patterns suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and mixed news from key figures like Vitalik Buterin indicate bearish sentiment, warranting a cautious reduction.

SOL: -0.1 — Despite positive DeFi developments, substantial investment outflows suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses and community engagement provide a mild positive signal, though price remains stagnant.

USDT: +0.1 — While generally stable, its role in DeFi and new blockchain integrations suggest maintaining a slight positive allocation for liquidity purposes."
2024-08-19 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.5 — While technical indicators are mixed, the potential for a Fed rate cut and strong on-chain holding sentiment provide a bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution, despite stable on-chain activity.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite positive developments in DeFi use cases, the large outflows from investment products and lack of technical momentum warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and bullish momentum signal a slight positive outlook, though price action remains muted.

USDT: -0.5 — With potential capital rotation towards riskier assets due to improving market sentiment, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-08-19 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable outlook with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 14.65. The anticipation of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts has stirred optimism in the crypto markets, particularly for Bitcoin, which has seen a rebound in sentiment. However, Ethereum faces pressure from significant ETF outflows, suggesting a cautious stance among institutional investors. Solana is experiencing notable outflows from investment products, reflecting some bearish sentiment, although its DeFi ecosystem continues to expand. Dogecoin's network engagement remains robust despite price stagnation, while Tether's integration into new blockchains and strong DeFi revenue performance highlight its continued utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive sentiment driven by potential Fed rate cuts and strong holding patterns suggest a moderate buy signal, despite mixed technical indicators.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant ETF outflows and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a cautious approach, though long-term fundamentals remain intact.

SOL: -0.2 — Despite positive DeFi developments, the record outflow from Solana products indicates bearish sentiment, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased active addresses and network engagement provide a slight bullish signal, though price action remains relatively flat.

USDT: +0.1 — While generally a safe haven, the current market conditions and capital rotation suggest maintaining a small allocation for liquidity purposes."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which is boosting confidence in the crypto markets. Bitcoin shows signs of bullish momentum with a significant portion of its supply being held long-term, indicating strong investor confidence. Ethereum, however, faces downward pressure due to substantial ETF outflows and mixed sentiment. Solana is experiencing significant outflows from investment products, although its DeFi ecosystem is expanding. Dogecoin is seeing increased network activity despite stagnant prices, suggesting underlying community engagement. Tether remains a stable choice, with recent developments on the Aptos blockchain enhancing its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the lack of a clear buy signal, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and strong long-term holding by investors suggest a favorable outlook, supported by macroeconomic optimism.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand, which outweighs any short-term technical signals.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana faces notable outflows, the expansion of its DeFi use cases and recent technical signals provide a moderate positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.1 — Increased network activity and community engagement provide a slight positive signal, though price action remains relatively flat.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed signals across the market and no strong directional bias, maintaining current USDT holdings is prudent for liquidity and stability."
2024-08-19 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential rebound due to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could boost crypto markets. However, Ethereum is experiencing pressure from significant ETF outflows, suggesting a mixed sentiment. Solana is facing challenges with substantial outflows from investment products, although its DeFi ecosystem is expanding. Dogecoin's network activity is increasing, indicating strong engagement despite stagnant prices. Tether remains a stable presence, with its expansion onto the Aptos blockchain and strong DeFi revenue performance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing bullish momentum with positive on-chain activity and supportive news about potential Fed rate cuts, suggesting a favorable environment for price appreciation.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite some bullish momentum, significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand create a cautious outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.3 — While facing investment outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases and technical signals suggest potential for recovery and growth.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network activity and strong community engagement provide a mildly positive outlook, though price action remains stagnant.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains a neutral holding, with no strong signals to increase or decrease exposure in the current market environment."
2024-08-19 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of bullish momentum driven by potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant portion of its supply remaining dormant, indicating strong holding behavior. Ethereum, however, faces headwinds from substantial ETF outflows and mixed institutional demand, despite some positive on-chain activity. Solana is experiencing a mixed environment, with significant outflows from investment products but expanding DeFi use cases. Dogecoin is seeing increased network engagement, although price action remains relatively stagnant. Tether remains stable, with positive developments in DeFi revenue and blockchain expansion.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum, combined with positive macroeconomic news and strong holding behavior, supports a favorable outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum, significant ETF outflows and mixed sentiment warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — While facing outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases and consistent bullish momentum provide moderate support.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and bullish momentum suggest a slight positive outlook, despite stagnant prices.

USDT: -0.4 — With a cautiously optimistic market, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-08-19 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of bullish momentum supported by expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, Ethereum is facing headwinds due to significant ETF outflows, which have negatively impacted its price. Solana is experiencing a mixed environment, with significant outflows from investment products but also expanding DeFi use cases. Dogecoin is seeing increased network engagement, although its price remains relatively stagnant. Tether continues to solidify its position in the DeFi space with strong revenue generation and new blockchain integrations. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.6** — Bitcoin is benefiting from bullish momentum and positive macroeconomic expectations. The high percentage of dormant supply indicates strong holding sentiment, which supports a positive allocation.

**ETH: -0.3** — Ethereum is under pressure from significant ETF outflows and mixed sentiment, despite maintaining bullish momentum. The overall environment suggests caution.

**SOL: +0.2** — While Solana faces outflows from investment products, its expanding DeFi use cases provide a positive outlook. The technical indicators remain bullish, warranting a modest positive score.

**DOGE: +0.1** — Increased network engagement is a positive sign, but the lack of significant price movement suggests a cautious approach. The score reflects slight optimism due to active addresses.

**USDT: 0.0** — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, there is no strong signal to increase or decrease exposure to USDT. The market does not indicate a significant shift in risk appetite."
2024-08-19 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no significant changes in key indicators like the 10-Year Treasury Yield and the U.S. Dollar Index. The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of optimism, particularly for Bitcoin, which is buoyed by expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Bitcoin's on-chain data suggests strong holding behavior, indicating bullish sentiment. Ethereum faces headwinds from significant ETF outflows, which have pressured its price despite some positive developments from its co-founder. Solana is experiencing substantial outflows from investment products, although it is expanding its DeFi use cases. Dogecoin is seeing increased network engagement, which is a positive sign despite stagnant prices. Tether remains a strong performer in the DeFi space, with new blockchain integrations and high revenue generation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive sentiment from potential Fed rate cuts. On-chain data supports a bullish outlook with a high percentage of dormant supply.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish momentum signals, significant ETF outflows and mixed news sentiment suggest caution. Current holdings are minimal, so a slight reduction is prudent.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite large outflows from investment products, Solana's expansion in DeFi use cases and positive technical indicators provide a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased network engagement and bullish momentum suggest a slight increase in allocation, although price remains relatively stable.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market conditions and the absence of current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is advisable to balance risk and opportunity."
2024-08-19 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant portion of BTC supply remaining dormant, indicating bullish sentiment. Ethereum faces mixed signals; despite bullish technical indicators, significant ETF outflows and institutional demand concerns weigh on its outlook. Solana experiences substantial outflows from investment products, though its DeFi ecosystem is expanding with new prediction markets. Dogecoin sees increased network engagement despite stagnant prices, suggesting underlying interest. Tether remains stable but shows no immediate bullish signals, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive news regarding potential rate cuts and long-term holding patterns suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish technical indicators, significant ETF outflows and weakening institutional demand create a cautious outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — While facing large outflows, Solana's expanding DeFi use cases provide some support for a modest positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased network engagement and strong technical indicators suggest a potential for upward movement, despite a lack of significant price changes.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin status and current market conditions suggest holding steady, with no clear signals for capital rotation."
2024-08-20 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, including expectations of rate cuts and options activity, support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Follows Bitcoin's bullish trend with similar rate-cut expectations and positive momentum, though slightly less pronounced.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive developments in Brazil with the approval of a Solana-based ETF, but tempered by U.S. regulatory concerns.

DOGE: +0.5 — Price surge driven by social media hype and accumulation by miners, indicating strong market interest.

Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant price increases observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. This positive momentum is driven by optimism surrounding potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and increased options activity. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced a ~4% rally, while Solana has seen positive developments with the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil, despite regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has also surged due to social media hype and significant on-chain accumulation by miners. Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding options activity and potential rate cuts make Bitcoin highly attractive. Current holdings should be increased to capitalize on the bullish trend.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from similar macroeconomic factors as Bitcoin, with strong price momentum and positive sentiment. Increasing exposure is advisable.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. The asset shows strong price momentum, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — The recent price surge driven by social media hype and miner accumulation suggests a positive short-term outlook. A slight increase in exposure is justified.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across the crypto market, capital should be rotated out of stablecoins like USDT to take advantage of growth opportunities in other assets."
2024-08-20 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity related to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable price increases, indicating strong market confidence. Solana is seeing mixed developments with positive news from Brazil but regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has benefited from social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk, leading to a price surge. Tether's recent minting activity suggests robust demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with bullish technical indicators and positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations. The overall market sentiment is supportive of further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is closely following Bitcoin's bullish trend, with strong technical signals and positive sentiment from anticipated dovish Fed signals. The correlation with Bitcoin supports a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, and the asset shows strong technical momentum, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's price surge driven by social media hype and increased on-chain activity suggests potential for further gains, though the speculative nature warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — While Tether's minting indicates strong demand, the current bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies suggests a rotation of capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-08-20 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimistic macroeconomic expectations and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both seen significant price increases, fueled by trader optimism and expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve. Solana has received mixed news, with positive developments in Brazil but regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a price surge due to social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk's cryptic comments. Tether's recent minting activity suggests robust demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum with significant price and on-chain activity increases, supported by positive news and macroeconomic expectations.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and price action, aligned with Bitcoin, driven by positive macroeconomic sentiment and dovish Fed expectations.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive developments in Brazil with the approval of a Solana-based ETF, though tempered by regulatory concerns in the U.S.

DOGE: +0.5 — Price surge driven by social media hype and increased on-chain activity, though the sustainability of this rally remains uncertain.

USDT: 0.0 — While there is strong demand for stablecoins, the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests limited need to increase stablecoin exposure at this time."
2024-08-20 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity related to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both seen price surges, supported by strong on-chain activity and positive news. Solana's market is buoyed by ETF developments in Brazil, despite regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a notable price increase due to social media hype and miner accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates robust demand, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity. The recent price surge and trader optimism make it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price movement is closely following Bitcoin, with bullish momentum and positive news regarding potential rate cuts. Its strong correlation with BTC supports a favorable allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana benefits from positive ETF news in Brazil, which enhances investor access. Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the overall sentiment remains positive, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's price has risen due to social media influence and miner accumulation. While the hype-driven nature of its rally suggests caution, the current momentum justifies a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — Although Tether's minting activity suggests strong demand, the overall bullish market sentiment encourages a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to allocate more capital to growth-oriented assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism surrounding potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and positive developments in the crypto space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced significant price increases, fueled by trader optimism and substantial options activity. Solana is seeing mixed news, with positive developments in Brazil contrasting with regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a price surge due to social media hype, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests robust demand and potential broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity. The market is optimistic about Bitcoin's price trajectory, making it a favorable asset to allocate more capital.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the same macroeconomic optimism as Bitcoin, with strong technical indicators and bullish sentiment. The alignment with Bitcoin's rally supports a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. The asset shows bullish technical indicators, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation indicate strong short-term momentum. Although speculative, the current sentiment supports a positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether's minting activity indicates demand, the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests maintaining current exposure to stablecoins without increasing allocation."
2024-08-20 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity related to the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable price increases, supported by positive news and strong on-chain activity. Solana is benefiting from international ETF developments, although regulatory uncertainties in the U.S. present some risks. Dogecoin has seen a price boost from social media hype and miner accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting signals robust demand, potentially catalyzing further market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, supported by increased on-chain activity and trader optimism.

ETH: +0.7 — Following Bitcoin's bullish trend with supportive macroeconomic news and strong on-chain metrics.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive international ETF developments and strong technical indicators, though tempered by U.S. regulatory concerns.

DOGE: +0.3 — Benefiting from social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation, though momentum is less pronounced than other assets.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether's minting indicates demand, the overall bullish sentiment suggests a rotation towards riskier assets, maintaining a neutral stance."
2024-08-20 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations provide a bullish outlook. The recent price surge and on-chain activity support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Following Bitcoin's lead, Ethereum shows bullish momentum with positive news on rate-cut expectations. The technical indicators support a favorable allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. The asset shows a potential breakout, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While benefiting from social media hype, the asset's technical indicators remain stable. A slight increase in allocation is justified by recent price movements and miner accumulation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent. The recent minting suggests strong demand, but the focus is shifting towards more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism surrounding potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and positive developments in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both seen price surges, supported by strong options activity and expectations of dovish monetary policy. Solana is experiencing mixed signals due to regulatory developments, with a new ETF approval in Brazil but regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. Dogecoin has been buoyed by social media hype and significant miner accumulation, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests robust demand for stablecoins, potentially catalyzing broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding rate-cut expectations and options activity suggest continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.7 — Following Bitcoin's lead, Ethereum is also benefiting from the dovish Fed outlook and has shown strong price momentum.

SOL: +0.3 — While regulatory concerns in the U.S. pose some risk, the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, supporting moderate bullish sentiment.

DOGE: +0.5 — Social media-driven price jumps and miner accumulation indicate strong interest, warranting increased exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the recent minting activity, the overall bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing stablecoin holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism surrounding potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity around the U.S. election. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced a ~4% rally, reflecting positive trader sentiment. Solana has seen mixed developments, with a new ETF approval in Brazil contrasting with regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has been buoyed by social media hype, particularly following comments from Elon Musk, leading to a notable price increase. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, which could support broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding options activity and potential rate cuts. The on-chain activity surge supports a continued upward trend.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is benefiting from the same macroeconomic drivers as Bitcoin, with strong momentum and positive sentiment from anticipated dovish Fed signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite U.S. regulatory challenges, the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, supporting moderate bullish sentiment.

DOGE: +0.5 — Social media-driven price increases and accumulation by miners indicate positive momentum, although the hype may be volatile.

USDT: -0.3 — While there is strong demand for USDT, the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, which has led to a rally in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent price surge is supported by substantial options activity and trader optimism, while Ethereum follows suit with similar gains. Solana faces mixed news with regulatory challenges in the U.S. but positive developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has experienced a price boost due to social media hype and miner accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates robust demand, potentially catalyzing broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding options activity and potential rate cuts support a bullish outlook. Current holdings should be increased to capitalize on the positive sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Following Bitcoin's lead, Ethereum shows bullish momentum and positive news, though slightly less pronounced. A moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., positive developments in Brazil provide some support. Maintain a cautious but optimistic stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation are positive, but the asset remains highly speculative. A slight increase is justified.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities."
2024-08-20 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, which has led to a rally in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge and increased options activity around the U.S. election indicate strong trader optimism. Ethereum is following Bitcoin's lead, with both assets showing bullish momentum. Solana has seen mixed news, with positive developments in Brazil countered by regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a price jump due to social media hype and miner accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting suggests robust demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, with significant options activity and rate-cut expectations supporting further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Following Bitcoin's lead with similar bullish momentum and positive macroeconomic expectations, though slightly less pronounced.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive developments in Brazil with ETF approval, but tempered by regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., leading to a cautious but positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price jump and miner accumulation provide a short-term boost, but the sustainability of this rally is uncertain.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the minting of new USDT, the overall market sentiment is risk-on, reducing the need for stablecoin exposure at this time."
2024-08-20 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by optimism around potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and positive developments in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced price surges, supported by increased options activity and trader optimism. Solana has seen mixed news, with positive developments in Brazil but regulatory challenges in the U.S. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has benefited from social media hype and miner accumulation, leading to a notable price increase. Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, which could support broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with increased on-chain activity and positive news around options activity and rate-cut expectations. This makes it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price movement is closely following Bitcoin, and the anticipation of dovish Fed signals supports a positive outlook. However, its momentum is slightly less pronounced than Bitcoin's.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. The asset's technical indicators remain supportive, albeit with less momentum than BTC and ETH.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin has benefited from social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation. While the hype is positive, the asset's volatility warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the recent minting activity indicating strong demand, the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests maintaining a neutral position in stablecoins, as capital is likely to rotate into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, which has led to a recent rally in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has shown strong upward momentum, supported by significant options activity and positive news regarding potential rate cuts. Ethereum has mirrored Bitcoin's movement, although its technical indicators remain mixed. Solana's market sentiment is mixed due to regulatory uncertainties in the U.S. but is buoyed by positive developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has experienced a price boost from social media hype and miner accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, although it may also signal broader market confidence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news around potential rate cuts and options activity suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. The recent price surge and on-chain activity further support this bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has rallied alongside Bitcoin, its technical indicators are less convincing. However, the broader market sentiment and dovish Fed expectations provide a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite regulatory concerns in the U.S., Solana has positive news from Brazil and maintains a buy signal. The mixed sentiment warrants a cautious but positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price increases driven by social media hype and miner accumulation suggest a slight positive bias, but the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of increased risk appetite, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT, despite the recent minting activity indicating strong demand."
2024-08-20 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of recovery driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and increased options activity. Bitcoin's recent price surge and Ethereum's tandem rise suggest a positive outlook, although technical indicators show mixed signals. Solana's market sentiment is mixed, with positive developments in Brazil contrasted by regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a price boost due to social media hype and miner accumulation, while Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand and potential for broader market rallies. Despite these developments, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, with stable volatility and a strong U.S. dollar index.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's price surge and positive news sentiment, coupled with bullish technical indicators, suggest a moderate buy signal, though recent price volatility warrants caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's rise alongside Bitcoin and positive news sentiment provide a modest buy signal, but technical indicators remain mixed, suggesting a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — While positive developments in Brazil are encouraging, regulatory challenges in the U.S. and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation support a slight buy signal, but the absence of strong technical indicators tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins seems prudent to capitalize on potential market rallies."
2024-08-20 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of recovery driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and increased options activity. Bitcoin's recent price surge and Ethereum's parallel rise suggest a potential shift in market dynamics favoring risk-on assets. Solana's market is mixed, with positive developments in Brazil contrasting with regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a notable price jump due to social media hype, while Tether's recent minting indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity, suggests a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from similar macroeconomic factors as Bitcoin, with dovish Fed expectations and a recent price rise indicating potential for continued growth.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory hurdles in the U.S., positive developments in Brazil and stable technical indicators support a modestly bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price increases driven by social media hype and miner accumulation suggest a cautiously optimistic stance, though the volatility warrants a tempered approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent in the current market environment."
2024-08-20 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and positive developments in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience with recent price surges, supported by trader optimism and substantial options activity. Solana's market is buoyed by regulatory developments in Brazil, although U.S. regulatory scrutiny remains a concern. Dogecoin has experienced a price boost from social media hype and miner accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially setting the stage for broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with recent price surges and positive news regarding options activity and rate-cut expectations. This suggests a favorable environment for increasing exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price movement is closely aligned with Bitcoin, benefiting from similar macroeconomic expectations. Despite mixed technicals, the overall sentiment is positive.

SOL: +0.3 — While Solana faces regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Social media-driven price increases and miner accumulation provide a short-term boost, but the lack of strong technical signals warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive market sentiment, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely, suggesting a reduction in exposure."
2024-08-20 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing a notable price surge driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and significant options activity around the U.S. election. Solana's market is mixed, with positive developments in Brazil contrasted by regulatory challenges in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a speculative price increase due to social media hype and miner accumulation. Meanwhile, Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's price surge and positive sentiment from options activity and potential rate cuts create a strong bullish outlook. The current portfolio holding can be increased to capitalize on this momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from similar macroeconomic factors as Bitcoin, with a price increase and dovish Fed expectations supporting a positive allocation signal.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil and the slight price increase suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — The social media-driven price increase and miner accumulation provide a moderate bullish signal, though the speculative nature warrants a conservative approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of increased risk appetite, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to reallocate capital towards more volatile assets."
2024-08-20 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing a notable rally driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and substantial options activity. This optimism is reflected in the price increases seen in both assets. Solana's market sentiment is mixed; while there is positive news from Brazil with the approval of a Solana-based ETF, regulatory uncertainties in the U.S. have caused some hesitation. Dogecoin has seen a price boost due to social media hype, particularly influenced by Elon Musk, but on-chain activity remains low. Tether's recent minting activity suggests strong demand and potential for broader market rallies, although its role as a stablecoin limits direct price appreciation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price rally and positive news regarding options activity and potential Fed rate cuts suggest a bullish outlook. The asset's current momentum and market optimism make it a favorable allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from similar macroeconomic factors as Bitcoin, with a significant price increase and positive sentiment from anticipated Fed actions. However, its technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a slightly less aggressive score than BTC.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development. The asset's price has been stable, and the news could attract more investors, justifying a modest positive score.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has seen a price increase due to social media hype, its low on-chain activity and lack of strong technical signals suggest a cautious approach. The score reflects the potential for short-term gains but acknowledges the speculative nature of recent movements.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of risk appetite, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT. The recent minting activity indicates demand, but the overall market sentiment favors riskier assets."
2024-08-20 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, which has led to a recent rally in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Bitcoin's price surge is further supported by substantial options activity and optimism around the U.S. election. Ethereum has mirrored Bitcoin's upward movement, indicating a positive correlation between the two. Solana's market sentiment is mixed; while the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, regulatory uncertainties in the U.S. pose challenges. Dogecoin has experienced a price boost due to social media hype, notably influenced by Elon Musk's cryptic reference. Meanwhile, Tether's minting of $1 billion USDT on the Tron network suggests strong demand for stablecoins, potentially catalyzing broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and positive news around options activity and rate-cut expectations provide strong bullish sentiment. The market is optimistic, and BTC remains a key asset to capitalize on this trend.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price movement is closely aligned with Bitcoin, benefiting from the same macroeconomic factors. The anticipation of dovish Fed signals supports a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — While the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil is a positive development, regulatory concerns in the U.S. temper enthusiasm. The asset remains attractive but with caution.

DOGE: +0.3 — Social media-driven price increases and accumulation by miners indicate potential for further gains. However, the lack of strong technical signals suggests a moderate allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of increased risk appetite, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, which has led to a recent rally in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged due to trader optimism and substantial options activity, while Ethereum has followed suit. Solana has seen mixed news, with positive developments in Brazil but regulatory hurdles in the U.S. Dogecoin experienced a price jump due to social media hype, while Tether's recent minting indicates strong demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and positive sentiment from options activity and rate-cut expectations suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is benefiting from the same macroeconomic factors as Bitcoin, with additional support from dovish Fed expectations.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite regulatory challenges in the U.S., the approval of a Solana-based ETF in Brazil provides a positive outlook, though caution is warranted.

DOGE: +0.2 — The recent price jump due to social media hype and miner accumulation suggests potential for short-term gains, but volatility remains a concern.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether's minting indicates demand, the current market sentiment favors risk assets, keeping USDT as a neutral hold for now."
2024-08-20 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by expectations of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, which has led to a recent rally in both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Bitcoin's price has shown resilience, rebounding toward $61K amid increased options activity and trader optimism. Ethereum has mirrored Bitcoin's movements, benefiting from similar macroeconomic expectations. Solana's market is experiencing mixed signals due to regulatory developments, with positive news from Brazil contrasting with regulatory hurdles in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a price increase fueled by social media hype and miner accumulation. Tether's recent minting activity indicates robust demand for stablecoins, potentially supporting broader market rallies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from options activity and dovish Fed expectations support a bullish outlook. However, technical indicators remain neutral, suggesting a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum benefits from macroeconomic optimism, but technicals are neutral. The alignment with Bitcoin's rally justifies a moderately positive score.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news from Brazil regarding Solana-based ETFs is offset by U.S. regulatory concerns. The mixed sentiment warrants a cautious positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price increases driven by social media and miner activity provide a slight bullish signal, but the lack of strong technical support suggests a conservative approach.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite strong demand indicated by recent minting, the overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, reducing the need for stablecoin exposure. However, maintaining a neutral score is prudent given the current market conditions."
2024-08-21 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.27. The crypto market is experiencing a mix of cautious optimism and potential for upward movement. Bitcoin's derivatives market signals a risk of a short squeeze, which could lead to a sharp price increase. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by BlackRock’s ETH ETF inflows, suggesting a potential bullish setup. Solana's market is influenced by significant whale activity and regulatory developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent price boost due to Elon Musk's influence, indicating renewed retail interest. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion with a new Dirham-backed stablecoin and significant USDT minting suggests increased liquidity and potential bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The potential for a short squeeze and minimal selling pressure from the Mt. Gox transfer create a favorable environment for BTC. The market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, warranting a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup due to increased on-chain supply support a positive outlook for ETH, despite the recent sideways technicals.

SOL: +0.2 — While there is some selling pressure from a major whale, the approval of a second SOL ETF in Brazil indicates positive regulatory sentiment, justifying a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price increases driven by Elon Musk's influence and heightened trading activity suggest a short-term boost in retail interest, supporting a slight positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market conditions and the absence of USDT holdings, maintaining a neutral position is prudent as the market assesses risk appetite and liquidity dynamics."
2024-08-21 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply make Ethereum attractive despite recent sideways technicals.

SOL: 0.0 — While regulatory developments in Brazil are positive, the significant selling by a major whale tempers enthusiasm, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed retail interest driven by Elon Musk's influence and increased trading activity provide a moderate bullish signal.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins seems prudent, especially given the recent minting activity indicating bullish sentiment elsewhere."
2024-08-21 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability, with the S&P 500 holding steady and the VIX indicating relatively low market volatility. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short-squeeze scenario, which could lead to a sharp price increase if triggered. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF. Solana's market is mixed, with significant whale selling but also positive regulatory developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent price boost due to Elon Musk's influence, indicating renewed retail interest. Tether is actively expanding its offerings, signaling potential bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The potential for a short-squeeze and minimal selling pressure from the Mt. Gox transfer suggest a positive outlook for BTC. The market sentiment is leaning towards a possible upward movement.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply suggest a favorable environment for ETH, despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with significant whale selling counterbalanced by positive regulatory news in Brazil. The market appears stable but lacks a clear directional bias.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price gains fueled by Elon Musk's influence and increased trading activity suggest a short-term positive sentiment, though the long-term outlook remains uncertain.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish flows into other cryptocurrencies, there may be a slight rotation out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT in the portfolio."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some bullish signals emerging despite a lack of strong technical buy signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze due to crowded short positions, which could lead to a sharp price increase. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF, suggesting a potential price rebound. Solana's regulatory support in Brazil and recent ETF approvals indicate growing interest, although a major whale's sell-off may temper enthusiasm. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and price following social media influence, indicating renewed retail interest. Meanwhile, Tether's recent issuance of $3 billion USDT and plans for a UAE dirham-pegged stablecoin suggest strategic positioning for future bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers provide a bullish outlook, despite current technical indicators not signaling a buy.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply suggest a favorable environment for price appreciation.

SOL: +0.3 — Regulatory support in Brazil and ETF approvals are positive, but recent whale sell-offs may limit immediate upside potential.

DOGE: +0.4 — Increased trading activity and price movement driven by social media suggest a positive short-term outlook, supported by elevated retail interest.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a mixed macroeconomic context, maintaining a neutral stance allows flexibility for future capital allocation based on market developments."
2024-08-21 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several key developments potentially influencing asset prices. Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze due to crowded short positions, which could lead to a sharp price increase if triggered. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of BlackRock’s ETH ETF, alongside a notable increase in on-chain supply, suggesting a possible bullish setup. Solana's market is witnessing mixed signals, with significant whale selling activity but also regulatory support in Brazil through a new ETF approval. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest and trading activity, largely driven by Elon Musk's influence, indicating heightened retail engagement. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of a large amount of USDT and plans for a new stablecoin suggest a bullish outlook for liquidity and potential market inflows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers create a favorable environment for a price increase.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and a bullish on-chain supply setup indicate a positive outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals from whale selling and regulatory support in Brazil suggest a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased retail interest and trading activity following Elon Musk's post provide a modestly positive outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish flows into other assets, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to capitalize on risk-on sentiment."
2024-08-21 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing a mix of neutral to slightly bullish signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze due to crowded short positions. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of the iShares Ethereum Trust, although on-chain supply increases could signal potential selling pressure. Solana is facing some selling pressure from a major whale but is buoyed by positive regulatory developments in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest and trading volume, largely driven by social media activity. Tether continues to expand its influence with new stablecoin initiatives, indicating strong market confidence in its liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — The potential for a short squeeze and minimal impact from Mt. Gox BTC transfers suggest a bullish outlook. The derivatives market signals could lead to upward price movement.

**ETH: +0.3** — Institutional interest is strong, as evidenced by the ETF inflows, and the recent on-chain supply increase could set the stage for a price rebound, though it warrants cautious optimism.

**SOL: +0.2** — Despite some selling pressure from a major whale, the approval of another SOL ETF in Brazil provides a supportive backdrop for potential gains.

**DOGE: +0.4** — Recent social media-driven price increases and a surge in trading volume suggest renewed retail interest, which could drive further short-term gains.

**USDT: 0.0** — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, there is no immediate need to increase exposure to USDT, especially as other assets show more potential for growth."
2024-08-21 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mix of cautious optimism and strategic positioning. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short-squeeze scenario, which could lead to a sharp upward movement if triggered. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by BlackRock’s ETH ETF inflows, suggesting a bullish setup. Solana's regulatory acceptance in Brazil and recent whale activity indicate mixed signals, with potential for both upward and downward pressures. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and price due to Elon Musk's influence, highlighting renewed retail interest. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT and plans for a UAE dirham-pegged stablecoin suggest strategic expansion and potential bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The potential for a short-squeeze and the limited impact of the Mt. Gox transfer create a favorable setup for upward movement, supported by increased on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand and a bullish on-chain supply setup indicate potential for price appreciation, despite recent low activity.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed signals from whale selling and regulatory approval in Brazil suggest cautious optimism, with potential for upward movement if regulatory support translates to increased adoption.

DOGE: +0.3 — The recent surge in trading activity and price due to Elon Musk's influence suggests short-term bullish sentiment, though sustainability is uncertain.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital potentially rotating into other assets, USDT may see reduced demand in the short term."

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some bullish signals emerging despite mixed macroeconomic indicators. Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze due to crowded short positions, and recent Mt. Gox BTC movements are unlikely to exert significant selling pressure. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by BlackRock's ETF inflows, although on-chain supply increases could signal upcoming volatility. Solana's regulatory approval for a second ETF in Brazil highlights growing institutional interest, despite recent whale selling. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in trading activity and price following Elon Musk's social media activity, indicating renewed retail interest. Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — The potential for a short squeeze and minimal impact from Mt. Gox BTC transfers suggest a favorable environment for upward movement. On-chain activity also supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply indicate a positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to recent supply increases on exchanges.

SOL: +0.3 — Regulatory approval for a second ETF in Brazil is a positive signal, though recent whale selling tempers enthusiasm. Overall, the asset remains attractive for incremental capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed retail interest and increased trading activity following Elon Musk's post provide a short-term boost, but the lack of broader market catalysts suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — While recent USDT issuance could indicate bullish flows, the stablecoin's role as a safe haven in uncertain macro conditions suggests maintaining current exposure without significant changes."
2024-08-21 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze due to crowded short positions, while Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF. Solana faces some selling pressure from a major whale but benefits from regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest due to Elon Musk's influence, while Tether is expanding its offerings with a new stablecoin and has recently minted a significant amount of USDT, suggesting potential bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a strong buy signal from technical indicators, the potential for a short squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers provide a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics suggest a favorable environment for Ethereum.

SOL: -0.1 — The selling pressure from a major whale is a concern, but regulatory support in Brazil offers some positive sentiment, resulting in a slightly cautious stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading activity and market cap, driven by Elon Musk's influence, provide a positive short-term outlook, though the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the potential for bullish flows into riskier assets, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent."
2024-08-21 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a positive risk sentiment in traditional markets, which can spill over into crypto markets. Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze, which could lead to a sharp price increase. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF, which could drive prices higher. Solana is experiencing mixed signals with significant selling pressure from a major whale, but regulatory approval for another ETF in Brazil could provide support. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in retail interest due to Elon Musk's influence, while Tether's issuance of a new stablecoin and increased USDT minting suggest a potential increase in liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — The potential for a short squeeze and minimal immediate selling pressure from the Mt. Gox transfer creates a strong bullish setup. The overall market sentiment and technical indicators support an upward movement.

**ETH: +0.6** — Institutional demand remains strong, as indicated by the ETH ETF's success. On-chain supply dynamics suggest a potential price rebound, making ETH an attractive asset in the current environment.

**SOL: +0.2** — Despite the selling pressure from a major whale, the approval of another SOL ETF in Brazil provides a positive regulatory signal. However, the technical indicators remain mixed, warranting a cautious approach.

**DOGE: +0.3** — Recent retail interest driven by Elon Musk's influence and increased trading activity suggest a short-term bullish sentiment. However, the lack of significant technical support tempers the enthusiasm.

**USDT: 0.0** — With no current holdings, USDT remains a neutral asset. The issuance of a new stablecoin and increased minting suggest liquidity is available, but the current market sentiment favors riskier assets."
2024-08-21 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by a relatively low VIX and stable S&P 500 levels. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing potential upward pressure due to a possible short squeeze, despite the large Mt. Gox transfer, which is unlikely to cause significant selling pressure. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of BlackRock's ETH ETF, although on-chain supply increases could signal potential selling pressure. Solana sees mixed signals with significant whale selling but regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has been buoyed by Elon Musk's influence, leading to a surge in trading activity and price. Tether continues to expand its market presence with new stablecoin initiatives, indicating robust demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the Mt. Gox transfer, the potential for a short squeeze and bullish momentum signals suggest a favorable outlook for BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — Institutional demand via the ETH ETF is positive, but the increase in on-chain supply warrants a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals from whale selling and regulatory support in Brazil create a neutral stance, as technical indicators do not show strong bullish momentum.

DOGE: +0.5 — Recent price and volume surges, driven by Elon Musk's influence, suggest increased retail interest and potential short-term gains.

USDT: -0.2 — With increased risk appetite and potential bullish flows into cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-08-21 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a low volatility index and a steady U.S. dollar index, suggesting a relatively calm period for risk assets. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, supported by potential short-squeeze scenarios in the derivatives market, while Ethereum is seeing strong institutional interest as indicated by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF. Solana's market sentiment is mixed due to significant whale selling, although regulatory developments in Brazil provide some support. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest and trading activity, largely driven by social media influence from Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish liquidity flows into the crypto market, although its own price remains stable as expected for a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and potential for a short squeeze make BTC attractive, especially with limited downside from recent Mt. Gox movements.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest and potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply suggest a positive outlook, though technicals remain neutral.

SOL: -0.2 — Despite regulatory support, significant whale selling and lack of bullish technical signals warrant caution, especially given current holdings.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased retail interest and trading volume driven by social media influence provide a modestly positive outlook, though the asset remains volatile.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance as market conditions do not strongly favor a shift into or out of stablecoins at this time."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze due to crowded short positions, which could lead to a sharp upward movement. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the significant inflows into the ETH ETF, suggesting a potential bullish setup despite mixed technical signals. Solana's market is experiencing some selling pressure from a major whale, but regulatory developments in Brazil could provide long-term support. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest and trading activity, largely driven by Elon Musk's influence, indicating renewed retail engagement. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of a new stablecoin and significant USDT minting suggests potential bullish flows, although it remains a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The potential for a short squeeze and strong bullish momentum signals suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.4 — Institutional interest and a potential bullish setup from increased on-chain supply support a positive stance, despite mixed technical indicators.

SOL: 0.0 — While regulatory developments are positive, the recent large sell-off by a whale and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a neutral position.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading activity and retail interest driven by Elon Musk's influence provide a modestly positive outlook, though caution is advised due to its volatility.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and potential bullish flows into other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent."
2024-08-21 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum and potential for a short squeeze, which could drive prices higher. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of the ETH ETF, although on-chain supply increases may temper immediate bullishness. Solana faces mixed signals with significant whale selling, but regulatory developments in Brazil could support future growth. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and price following Elon Musk's influence, indicating renewed retail interest. Tether remains stable with significant minting activity, suggesting potential bullish flows into the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential for a short squeeze, combined with limited sell pressure from Mt. Gox, make BTC highly attractive.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional demand and potential for a price rebound due to increased on-chain supply support a moderately positive outlook for ETH.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals from whale selling and positive regulatory news in Brazil suggest a neutral stance for now.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading activity and price movement driven by Elon Musk's influence indicate a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive momentum in other assets and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable."
2024-08-21 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward movement due to the risk of a short squeeze and limited selling pressure from Mt. Gox transfers. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional interest, evidenced by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF, although on-chain supply increases could indicate potential selling pressure. Solana's market is mixed, with significant whale selling counterbalanced by regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a recent surge in interest and trading activity, largely driven by social media influence. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of new USDT suggests anticipation of increased market activity, although it remains a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's technical indicators and news of potential short squeezes suggest strong upward momentum. The limited impact of Mt. Gox BTC transfers further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional interest is strong, as shown by ETF inflows, and bullish momentum is supported by technical indicators, despite a rise in on-chain supply.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with significant whale selling and regulatory support in Brazil. Current technicals do not indicate a strong directional bias.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading activity and social media-driven interest suggest a moderate positive outlook, but the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.2 — While Tether's recent issuance indicates potential market activity, the overall positive sentiment in risk assets suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-08-21 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by potential short-squeeze scenarios in the derivatives market. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF, although on-chain supply increases could signal potential volatility. Solana faces mixed signals with significant whale selling, but regulatory support in Brazil could provide a positive backdrop. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and price due to Elon Musk's influence, indicating renewed retail interest. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin means it will likely see capital rotation as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential short-squeeze scenario in derivatives markets suggest a favorable outlook for BTC, supported by limited immediate selling pressure from Mt. Gox-related transfers.

ETH: +0.5 — Institutional demand remains robust with the ETH ETF milestone, and while on-chain supply has increased, the overall sentiment remains positive, suggesting potential for price appreciation.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite significant whale selling, regulatory support in Brazil and the approval of a second SOL ETF provide a positive long-term outlook, though immediate signals are mixed.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed retail interest driven by Elon Musk's influence and a surge in trading activity suggest a positive short-term outlook, though the overall market impact may be limited.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and potential bullish flows into other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce exposure to USDT in favor of more volatile assets."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum supported by positive technical indicators and news. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short-squeeze scenario, which could lead to a sharp price increase. Ethereum's institutional interest is highlighted by the success of the ETH ETF, suggesting strong demand despite some recent sell pressure. Solana's market is mixed, with significant whale selling but also regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in retail interest due to Elon Musk's influence, while Tether's recent minting activity suggests potential for increased market liquidity. Overall, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and supportive conditions for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential short-squeeze scenario make BTC highly attractive. Positive news regarding limited market impact from Mt. Gox transfers further supports this view.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand and bullish on-chain activity indicate a favorable outlook. The recent ETF milestone adds to the positive sentiment.

SOL: -0.1 — Mixed signals with whale selling pressure offset by regulatory support in Brazil. No strong buy signals present, warranting a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed retail interest driven by Elon Musk's influence and increased trading activity suggest potential for short-term gains.

USDT: -0.5 — With overall bullish sentiment and increased risk appetite, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several bullish indicators across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum, supported by potential short-squeeze risks in the derivatives market, although the Mt. Gox BTC transfer poses a minor liquidation threat. Ethereum is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of BlackRock's ETH ETF, and a potential bullish setup due to increased on-chain supply. Solana's market activity is mixed, with significant whale selling counterbalanced by regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in retail interest and trading volume, largely driven by Elon Musk's influence. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests increased liquidity, potentially indicating a bullish sentiment in the broader market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and potential short-squeeze scenarios, coupled with bullish sentiment from derivatives markets.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand and a potential bullish setup due to increased on-chain supply, alongside positive technical indicators, support a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite whale selling, regulatory support in Brazil and stable technical indicators suggest a cautious but positive stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased retail interest and trading volume, driven by Elon Musk's influence, indicate a positive short-term outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, maintaining high USDT exposure is less attractive."
2024-08-21 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by strong upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short-squeeze scenario, which could lead to a sharp price increase. Ethereum is seeing significant institutional interest, as evidenced by the success of BlackRock's ETH ETF. Solana's market activity is mixed, with large sales by a whale but also regulatory approvals for new ETFs in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in interest and trading volume, partly due to social media influence from Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of a new stablecoin and significant minting activity indicates potential bullish flows into the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential short-squeeze scenario suggest a bullish outlook. The news of limited market impact from Mt. Gox BTC transfers further supports this.

ETH: +0.7 — Institutional demand and potential bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics indicate a favorable environment for Ethereum, despite recent price increases.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed signals with whale selling activity, but positive regulatory developments in Brazil provide some support for a cautious buy stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased trading activity and positive sentiment driven by social media influence suggest a bullish short-term outlook, although the price has already seen a significant jump.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite bullish flows into the market, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT as it serves as a stable hedge in case of volatility."
2024-08-21 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short-squeeze scenario, which could lead to a sharp price increase. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by the success of the iShares Ethereum Trust. Solana's market activity is mixed, with some large sell-offs but also regulatory support in Brazil. Dogecoin has seen a surge in interest and price due to Elon Musk's influence and increased trading activity. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its offerings with a new Dirham-pegged stablecoin and has recently minted a substantial amount of USDT, suggesting potential bullish flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and potential short-squeeze could drive prices higher. The news of limited Mt. Gox liquidation further reduces downside risk.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand is robust, and the potential for a price rebound is supported by increased on-chain supply. The ETF milestone is a positive signal.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite some large sell-offs, regulatory support in Brazil and a stable price trend suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — Renewed retail interest and significant price movement driven by Elon Musk's influence and increased trading volume indicate a positive short-term outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT expansion suggests potential bullish flows, the current market conditions favor risk assets over stablecoins, maintaining a neutral stance."
2024-08-21 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum supported by technical indicators and positive news. Bitcoin's potential short-squeeze scenario and Ethereum's ETF inflows highlight increased institutional interest. Solana's market activity is mixed, with significant whale selling counterbalanced by regulatory approval for a new ETF in Brazil. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in retail interest following a social media post by Elon Musk, leading to increased trading activity. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT suggests potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin typically indicates a more defensive position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential for a short squeeze make BTC attractive. The limited impact of Mt. Gox BTC transfers further supports a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics are positive, though tempered by recent price stability.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with whale selling offset by regulatory support in Brazil. No strong directional bias at this time.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased retail interest and trading activity following Elon Musk's post provide a short-term boost, though the long-term outlook remains uncertain.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, reducing USDT exposure to allocate more capital into riskier assets aligns with the current sentiment."
2024-08-21 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum, supported by potential short-squeeze scenarios and minimal selling pressure from Mt. Gox-related transfers. Ethereum's institutional interest remains robust, highlighted by significant inflows into the first ETH ETF, suggesting a potential price rebound. Solana faces mixed signals with significant whale selling, but regulatory approval for a new ETF in Brazil may bolster confidence. Dogecoin has seen a surge in trading activity and price, driven by renewed retail interest following Elon Musk's social media activity. Tether's recent minting activity and plans for a UAE dirham-pegged stablecoin indicate potential bullish flows, although the market remains vigilant about broader macroeconomic conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and potential short-squeeze scenarios suggest a favorable outlook. The limited impact from Mt. Gox transfers further supports a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand and potential bullish setups from increased on-chain supply indicate a positive outlook, despite recent sideways price action.

SOL: +0.3 — While whale selling presents a bearish risk, regulatory approval for a new ETF in Brazil provides a supportive backdrop, warranting a cautious positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased trading activity and price movements driven by Elon Musk's influence suggest heightened retail interest, supporting a moderate buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite recent minting activity, the overall market sentiment favors risk assets, suggesting a neutral stance on stablecoins as capital rotates into more volatile assets."
2024-08-21 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze, which could drive prices higher, supported by strong on-chain activity and technical indicators. Ethereum is seeing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by significant inflows into the iShares Ethereum Trust, alongside a potential bullish setup from increased exchange supply. Solana's regulatory acceptance in Brazil and stable technical indicators suggest a steady outlook, despite some large sell-offs. Dogecoin has experienced a surge in retail interest following Elon Musk's social media activity, driving up trading volume and price. Meanwhile, Tether's issuance of $3 billion USDT indicates potential bullish flows, although its role as a stablecoin suggests a more defensive position in the portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and potential for a short squeeze, coupled with minimal impact from Mt. Gox-related news, suggest a favorable outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Institutional demand and a potential bullish setup from on-chain supply dynamics support a positive allocation, despite recent price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.3 — Regulatory developments in Brazil and stable technical indicators provide a moderate positive outlook, though tempered by recent large sell-offs.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased retail interest and trading activity following Elon Musk's post suggest a short-term bullish sentiment, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT serves as a neutral position in the portfolio, with no immediate need to increase or decrease exposure given current market conditions."
2024-08-22 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-08-22 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with potential for a short squeeze, suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite bearish sentiment from whale sales, technical indicators remain positive, warranting a cautious buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest driven by social media activity and stable technical indicators suggest moderate upside potential.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the overall bullish sentiment and positive signals across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with the S&P 500 at a high level and relatively low volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals; while technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and SOL remain bullish, recent price movements show a slight downturn, suggesting caution among investors. Bitcoin is nearing a potential short squeeze, while Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales. Solana shows signs of accumulation by large holders, indicating potential upward movement. Dogecoin sentiment has been slightly boosted by social media activity, but lacks strong technical support. Tether remains stable with new developments in stablecoin offerings.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, BTC shows strong technical indicators and potential for a short squeeze, making it relatively attractive in the current market.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum faces downward pressure from whale sales, and while technical indicators are positive, the lack of strong upward momentum suggests a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and new trading ecosystem developments provide a strong foundation for potential gains, making SOL an attractive option.

DOGE: 0.1 — Social media-driven sentiment provides a slight positive bias, but the lack of strong technical signals warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential upward movements in other assets, maintaining high exposure to USDT is less attractive, suggesting a slight reduction in favor of riskier assets."
2024-08-22 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable outlook with moderate volatility, as indicated by a VIX of 17.55. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a bullish sentiment in traditional markets, which can spill over into crypto markets. Bitcoin is showing signs of potential upward movement with a possible short squeeze near $62K, while Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales. Solana is seeing accumulation by large holders, indicating confidence in its price support. Dogecoin has experienced a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's social media activity. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which may enhance its utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong technical signals with potential for a short squeeze, supported by increased on-chain activity. The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, favoring a moderate increase in BTC allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite bullish technical indicators, Ethereum is under pressure from whale sales, and the price remains below a critical resistance level. This warrants a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana benefits from whale accumulation and positive ecosystem developments, such as the addition of PYUSD trading. These factors support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent positive sentiment from Elon Musk's activity provides a short-term boost, but lacking strong technical or fundamental changes, the score remains modestly positive.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, USDT remains neutral as the market shows mixed signals, balancing risk appetite with the need for liquidity."
2024-08-22 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a cautiously optimistic sentiment, with Bitcoin experiencing a potential short squeeze as it approaches the $62K resistance level. Despite a recent price increase, the overall macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain, which is reflected in the cautious market outlook. Ethereum is facing downward pressure due to whale sales, indicating bearish sentiment unless it breaks the $3,050 level. Solana is seeing accumulation by whales at the $135 support, suggesting potential for a breakout towards $155, bolstered by new trading support for PYUSD. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by Elon Musk's recent AI-themed post, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings with a new Dirham-pegged token.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical signals and potential for a short squeeze near $62K suggest a favorable outlook, despite the cautious macro environment.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued downward pressure from whale sales and the need to break $3,050 for a bullish reversal warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation at support levels and new trading ecosystem developments provide a positive outlook for potential gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's post boosts sentiment, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive signals in risk assets like BTC and SOL, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-22 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze as bulls target resistance around $62K. Despite recent price increases, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, which could temper bullish momentum. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, needing a significant breakout to reverse sentiment. Solana shows positive signs with whale accumulation and ecosystem expansion through new stablecoin support. Dogecoin sentiment has been buoyed by social media influence, while Tether continues to expand its global stablecoin offerings, potentially increasing its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze and has been gaining momentum, but the cautious macro environment warrants a moderate allocation increase.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is under pressure from whale sales, and without a clear breakout, it remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem expansion through new stablecoin support suggest a positive outlook, making it attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from social media influence provides a slight positive sentiment, but lacking strong technical signals, a modest increase is warranted.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the cautious optimism in the market, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with potential upside."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, with the VIX at 17.55, indicating a relatively stable market sentiment. Bitcoin is showing potential for a short squeeze as it approaches resistance near $62K, supported by a recent price increase and active on-chain transactions. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale selling, although it remains relatively stable just below $2,600. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whales at the $135 support level, with potential for a breakout, while Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by Elon Musk's recent social media activity. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged token, reflecting its strategic growth in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and active on-chain activity suggest a favorable outlook, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite stable price action, bearish sentiment from whale selling and lack of significant upward momentum warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and positive developments in its ecosystem, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, support a positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest driven by social media activity from Elon Musk provides a moderate bullish sentiment for Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and potential bullish movements in other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2024-08-22 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a positive risk sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is experiencing cautious optimism with potential for a short squeeze, while Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale selling. Solana is seeing accumulation from large holders, indicating potential for upward movement. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from social media influence, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which could enhance its utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze and has a positive trend signal, suggesting a moderate buy opportunity despite cautious market sentiment.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum faces downward pressure from whale sales, and despite a positive trend signal, the overall sentiment remains mixed, warranting a slight reduction.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong accumulation by whales and positive technical indicators suggest a favorable outlook for Solana, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest driven by social media influence provides a minor positive sentiment boost, but fundamentals remain unchanged.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as other assets present more attractive opportunities."
2024-08-22 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a low volatility index (VIX at 17.55) and a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 101.51). The crypto market is experiencing a cautious yet positive sentiment, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze near $62K, despite a cautious macro outlook. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales, while Solana is seeing accumulation by whale wallets, suggesting a potential breakout. Dogecoin has experienced a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent social media activity. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which may enhance its utility and appeal in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze with bullish technical signals, despite a cautious macro environment. The overall sentiment is moderately positive, warranting increased exposure.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum is under bearish pressure due to whale sales and needs to break significant resistance to reverse sentiment. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is experiencing whale accumulation and positive ecosystem developments, suggesting a potential breakout. Increased allocation is justified.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from Elon Musk's social media activity provides a mild bullish signal, supporting a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed signals across the market and no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent to allow flexibility in adjusting to market shifts."
2024-08-22 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a cautious yet slightly bullish sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential short squeeze, with analysts eyeing resistance near $62K, indicating bullish pressure despite a cautious macro outlook. Ethereum is facing downward pressure due to whale sales, suggesting bearish sentiment unless it breaks above $3,050. Solana is seeing accumulation by whales at the $135 support level, with positive developments like the addition of PYUSD trading on its network. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by Elon Musk's recent tweet, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings with a new Dirham-pegged token, indicating a strategic move to broaden its market presence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows potential for a short squeeze with bullish pressure at resistance levels, supported by high on-chain activity, suggesting a positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical indicators, whale sales are exerting downward pressure, creating a mixed sentiment that warrants a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and positive ecosystem developments like PYUSD trading support a bullish outlook, indicating potential for upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's tweet provides a slight positive sentiment boost, but lacking strong technical signals, the score remains modest.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as there's no strong signal to shift capital into or out of stablecoins."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near the $62K resistance level, supported by recent price increases. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, although its price remains relatively stable. Solana is experiencing accumulation by large holders, suggesting confidence in a potential breakout. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost due to social media activity, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, indicating a strategic push for broader adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price momentum suggest a favorable outlook, despite overall market caution.

ETH: -0.1 — Continued whale selling and the need to break key resistance levels keep Ethereum in a slightly bearish position, though not enough to warrant a strong sell signal.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation at support levels and positive ecosystem developments indicate a bullish outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest from social media activity has improved sentiment, providing a moderate buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance as the market shows mixed signals regarding risk appetite."
2024-08-22 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential upward movement, supported by a possible short squeeze near the $62K resistance level. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, but maintains a stable price around $2,600. Solana is experiencing accumulation at the $135 support level, suggesting potential for a breakout. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by Elon Musk's recent social media activity. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which may bolster its utility and demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price rise indicate a favorable outlook, though cautious sentiment persists in the broader market.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, Ethereum faces downward pressure from whale sales, keeping its price relatively stable and justifying a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and recent ecosystem developments, such as Bitget's support for PYUSD, suggest strong potential for upward movement.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest driven by Elon Musk's influence could lead to further price appreciation, though the overall market impact remains moderate.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing interest in risk assets like BTC and SOL, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-08-22 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near $62K, despite a generally cautious macroeconomic environment. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales, although it remains relatively stable just under $2,600. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whales at the $135 support level, indicating potential for a breakout, further supported by the addition of PYUSD trading on its network. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent AI-themed post, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham–pegged token, indicating ongoing growth in the stablecoin sector.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and positive news sentiment suggest a favorable outlook. The overall market environment remains cautious but supportive for BTC.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing downward pressure from whale sales, and technical indicators are mixed. The asset remains stable but lacks a strong directional signal.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation at key support levels and positive developments in its trading ecosystem suggest potential for upward movement, making it an attractive option.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed interest driven by Elon Musk's post has improved sentiment, although technical indicators remain neutral. The asset shows potential for short-term gains.

USDT: -0.2 — With increased interest in other assets and positive developments in the crypto market, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-08-22 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum and potential for a short squeeze near $62K make it attractive, supported by increased on-chain activity and positive news sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite stable technical indicators, ETH faces downward pressure from whale sales, suggesting a cautious approach until it breaks above $3,050.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and positive ecosystem developments, such as the integration of PYUSD trading, indicate strong potential for upward movement.

USDT: -0.3 — With rising risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, maintaining high exposure to USDT is less attractive in the current market environment."
2024-08-22 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and cautious investor sentiment, as indicated by the VIX and recent market data. Bitcoin is showing signs of potential upward movement with discussions around a short squeeze, although overall market caution persists. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, keeping it below key resistance levels. Solana is experiencing accumulation by large holders, suggesting potential for upward movement, while Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent social media activity. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which could enhance its utility but does not directly impact its trading dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price decreases, Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and positive trend signals suggest a moderate buy opportunity, especially given its role as a market leader.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from whale sales and technical breakdowns, making it less attractive in the short term. Current holdings should be reduced slightly.

SOL: +0.6 — Accumulation by whales and positive ecosystem developments like the PYUSD support on Solana indicate a strong potential for upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — While largely stable, the recent sentiment boost from Elon Musk's post provides a slight positive bias, warranting a small increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the cautious market sentiment and lack of current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as it serves as a safe haven during uncertainty."
2024-08-22 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential short squeeze near $62K, suggesting bullish pressure despite a recent price decline. Ethereum faces bearish sentiment due to whale sales, keeping it below the $2,600 mark, with a need to break $3,050 for a bullish reversal. Solana is experiencing whale accumulation at $135, indicating potential for a breakout towards $155, supported by ecosystem enhancements like the addition of PYUSD trading. Dogecoin sentiment has been positively influenced by Elon Musk's recent activities, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged token.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, the potential for a short squeeze and bullish pressure near $62K suggests a moderate buy signal, supported by positive market sentiment.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued downward pressure from whale sales and the need for a significant price breakout to reverse sentiment warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem enhancements provide a strong case for capital allocation, with potential for a breakout towards $155.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment driven by Elon Musk's influence offers a slight buy signal, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market conditions and absence of USDT holdings, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent as risk appetite remains cautious."
2024-08-22 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a cautious investor sentiment, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate level of volatility as indicated by the VIX. Bitcoin appears to be on the verge of a potential short squeeze, with analysts eyeing a breakout above $62K, although the overall market outlook remains cautious. Ethereum is facing bearish pressure due to whale sales, and it needs to break above $3,050 to reverse this sentiment. Solana is seeing accumulation by whales at the $135 support level, suggesting potential for upward movement. Dogecoin has experienced a sentiment boost due to Elon Musk's influence, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings with a new Dirham-pegged token.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the cautious macro environment, BTC shows potential for a short squeeze and has a positive trend signal, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and lack of bullish signals suggest a need to reduce exposure, especially given the bearish sentiment.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation at a key support level and positive news regarding ecosystem expansion provide a strong case for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from Elon Musk's influence and a surge in on-chain activity suggest moderate potential for gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential upward movements in BTC and SOL, reducing stablecoin exposure could be beneficial to capitalize on risk asset opportunities."
2024-08-22 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and a stable U.S. dollar, with the S&P 500 showing strength, suggesting a cautiously optimistic sentiment in broader markets. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is showing signs of potential upward movement with a possible short squeeze near $62K, although overall market sentiment remains cautious. Ethereum is under pressure from whale sales, keeping its price below $2,600. Solana is seeing accumulation by whales, indicating potential for a breakout, while Dogecoin has experienced a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent activities. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, which may increase its attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest a moderate buy opportunity.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and the inability to break key resistance levels indicate a need to reduce exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and recent ecosystem developments, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, support a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased interest from Elon Musk's activities provides a slight boost in sentiment, but no strong technical signals are present.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent to allow flexibility for potential capital rotation."
2024-08-22 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment remains cautious, with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows signs of a potential short squeeze near $62K, although the broader macro environment is marked by investor caution. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, needing a breakout above $3,050 to reverse sentiment. Solana sees accumulation by whales at $135, suggesting potential for a breakout, while Dogecoin experiences renewed interest due to Elon Musk's influence. Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings, indicating a strategic push into new markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the cautious macro environment, Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest a moderately bullish outlook.

ETH: -0.2 — Continued downward pressure from whale sales and the need for a significant breakout to reverse sentiment justify a slightly bearish stance.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and ecosystem expansion through new stablecoin support provide a positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is a slight uptick in sentiment due to external influences, the overall technicals remain unchanged, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the cautious market environment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent, although the overall sentiment is slightly risk-on."
2024-08-22 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze near the $62K resistance level, although the overall macro environment remains uncertain. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales, and its price is struggling to maintain above the $2,600 mark. Solana is experiencing positive accumulation by whales at the $135 support, with a potential breakout towards $155, bolstered by new trading support for PayPal's PYUSD. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost from Elon Musk's recent AI-themed post, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged token. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, suggest a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued downward pressure from whale sales and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given the minimal current holdings.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and positive news regarding trading ecosystem enhancements indicate a strong buy signal, with potential for a breakout.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest from Elon Musk's post provides a slight positive sentiment boost, but technicals remain neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed market signals and no strong directional bias, maintaining current stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-08-22 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze as it approaches a key resistance level around $62K. Despite a recent price increase, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, which could temper bullish momentum. Ethereum faces bearish pressure due to whale sales, and it needs to break above $3,050 to reverse this trend. Solana is seeing accumulation by large holders at the $135 support level, suggesting potential for a breakout. Dogecoin has experienced renewed interest due to social media influence, while Tether continues to expand its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham–pegged token.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential short squeeze, and the recent price increase suggests bullish momentum. However, caution is warranted due to the broader macroeconomic uncertainty.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under bearish pressure from whale sales, and technical indicators do not support a strong upward move. The need to break $3,050 adds to the cautious outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's accumulation by whales at the $135 support level and positive developments in its trading ecosystem indicate strong potential for a breakout, making it an attractive asset.

DOGE: +0.2 — Renewed interest driven by social media influence provides a slight positive sentiment, but without significant technical or on-chain support, the outlook remains moderate.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market signals and lack of current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, especially as other assets show potential for gains."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing potential for a short squeeze near $62K, despite a generally cautious macro environment. Ethereum faces bearish pressure from whale sales, keeping its price under $2,600. Solana is experiencing accumulation by whales at the $135 support level, indicating potential for a breakout. Dogecoin has seen a sentiment boost due to Elon Musk's social media activity, while Tether is expanding its stablecoin offerings with a new UAE Dirham-pegged token. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a neutral to slightly bullish environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a short squeeze and recent price increase suggest a moderate bullish outlook, warranting increased exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued selling pressure from whales and the inability to break key resistance levels suggest reducing exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and positive ecosystem developments, such as the addition of PYUSD trading, support a bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased interest driven by social media activity provides a slight positive sentiment, but no strong technical signals.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a neutral macro environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate."
