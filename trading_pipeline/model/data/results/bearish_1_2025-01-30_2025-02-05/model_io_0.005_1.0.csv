2025-01-30 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has led to increased investor confidence and inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This has resulted in a rally across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing price surges. Solana has outperformed its peers, reflecting strong market momentum. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to potential ETF developments, while Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network indicates a focus on improving cross-network payment efficiencies. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a risk-on environment, encouraging capital rotation into cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic developments are driving a bullish sentiment, making Bitcoin a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader crypto rally and positive price momentum, though slightly less pronounced than Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.9 — Solana's significant outperformance and strong market momentum make it the most attractive asset for allocation, supported by recent price gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation about potential ETF developments provides a moderate bullish signal, though less compelling compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.7 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on the bullish market conditions."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has led to a surge in cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin has experienced a notable increase, supported by significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana are also benefiting from the broader market rally, with Solana outperforming many of its peers. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to speculation about potential ETF approval, which could enhance its institutional appeal. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its utility by launching on the Bitcoin and Lightning networks, although its role as a stablecoin suggests limited price movement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news. The bullish sentiment and institutional interest make it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and positive sentiment. While not as strong as Bitcoin, its upward price movement and market optimism justify a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana is outperforming in the current market upswing, with significant price increases and positive news. Its strong performance relative to other assets supports a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation about potential ETF approval is boosting Dogecoin's appeal. While not as strong as other assets, the potential for institutional traction warrants a cautious buy signal.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is rotating out of stablecoins like USDT. The current market conditions favor reallocating capital into more volatile assets with higher growth potential."
2025-01-30 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has bolstered investor confidence and led to a rally in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a significant price increase, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also experienced price surges, with Solana outperforming many of its peers. Dogecoin is gaining attention with speculation about potential ETF approvals, which could enhance its institutional appeal. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network suggests a focus on improving cross-network payment efficiency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The combination of strong ETF inflows and bullish momentum signals, along with positive macroeconomic news, supports a strong buy signal for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and positive price momentum, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

SOL: +0.9 — Solana's significant price increase and outperforming market peers, along with bullish news, justify a strong buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is experiencing increased interest due to potential ETF developments, the current momentum is less pronounced compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish sentiment, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a rotation of capital into more volatile assets."
2025-01-30 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has surged past $105K, supported by significant ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing strong upward momentum, with Solana outperforming many of its peers. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to speculation about potential ETF developments, while Tether is expanding its network capabilities by launching on the Bitcoin/Lightning network. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a strong S&P 500, further supports the positive sentiment in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and significant ETF inflows indicate robust institutional demand, supporting further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Benefiting from the broader market rally and positive sentiment, with technical indicators showing bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.9 — Outperforming in the current market upswing, with significant price increases and strong technical signals suggesting continued growth potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment driven by potential ETF developments and increased on-chain activity, though less pronounced than other assets.

2025-01-30 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's pause on rate hikes, which has boosted investor confidence and led to significant inflows into Bitcoin-focused ETFs. This optimism has spilled over into the broader crypto market, with Ethereum and Solana experiencing notable price increases. Bitcoin's price surge is supported by strong institutional demand, as evidenced by substantial ETF inflows. Solana has outperformed during this upswing, while Dogecoin is gaining speculative interest due to potential ETF developments. Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network indicates ongoing innovation in stablecoin utility, although its primary role remains as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and significant ETF inflows indicate robust institutional demand. The macroeconomic environment supports further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Benefiting from the broader market rally and positive price momentum, Ethereum remains attractive, although slightly less so than Bitcoin due to less pronounced institutional interest.

SOL: +0.7 — Outperforming in the current market upswing with strong price momentum and positive news, making it a compelling allocation target.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest due to potential ETF developments provides a moderate bullish signal, but lacks the institutional backing seen in BTC and ETH.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, holding a large USDT position is less attractive. Reducing exposure to capitalize on bullish conditions in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has sparked renewed investor confidence across the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating robust institutional demand. Ethereum and Solana have also experienced notable price increases, riding the wave of market-wide optimism. Dogecoin, while not experiencing the same level of price action, has potential upside due to speculation about future ETF approvals. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with recent developments enhancing its utility for cross-network payments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic developments. This makes it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader crypto rally and positive market sentiment, making it an attractive asset to hold and potentially increase exposure to.

SOL: +0.9 — Solana is outperforming other assets in the current market upswing, with significant price gains and strong technical indicators, warranting a high allocation score.

DOGE: +0.3 — While not as strong as other assets, Dogecoin's potential for future ETF-related developments provides a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable in the current bullish environment."
2025-01-30 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has bolstered investor confidence and led to a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen significant inflows into ETFs, indicating strong institutional interest, while Ethereum and Solana have also experienced price surges. The news of Tether launching on the Bitcoin/Lightning network adds a positive development for USDT, enhancing its utility. However, the macroeconomic indicators, such as a high U.S. Dollar Index and stable S&P 500, suggest a cautious approach is still warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news. The bullish sentiment and technical indicators suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and positive price momentum. However, its performance is slightly less pronounced than Bitcoin's, warranting a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is outperforming in the current market upswing, with strong price action and positive news sentiment. Its relative strength compared to other assets justifies a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is experiencing some positive sentiment due to ETF speculation, its price action and on-chain activity are less compelling than other assets, leading to a cautious positive stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish market conditions, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into riskier assets with higher return potential."
2025-01-30 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has boosted investor confidence and led to a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen significant inflows into ETFs, indicating strong institutional interest, while Ethereum and Solana have also experienced price surges. The broader market optimism is reflected in the positive momentum and technical indicators across these assets. Dogecoin is showing potential for future institutional interest with speculation around ETF approvals. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin and Lightning networks highlights its ongoing efforts to enhance cross-network payment capabilities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and bullish momentum signals suggest continued upward potential. The macroeconomic environment is supportive of further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Benefiting from the broader market rally and positive momentum indicators. The price is near a breakout, indicating further upside potential.

SOL: +0.7 — Outperforming in the current market upswing with strong price action and positive news sentiment. Technical indicators support further gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — While the technicals are positive, the lack of immediate catalysts and lower on-chain activity suggest a more cautious approach. Potential future ETF developments could enhance attractiveness.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets. The current market environment favors risk-on assets."
2025-01-30 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has boosted investor confidence and led to significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This has resulted in a rally across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing price increases. Solana has notably outperformed other assets, benefiting from the broader market upswing.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic developments. The Fed's pause on rate hikes further enhances Bitcoin's appeal as a risk asset.

ETH: +0.6 — Benefiting from the broader crypto rally and positive price momentum. Ethereum's technical indicators remain strong, supporting a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.9 — Outperforming in the current market rally with significant price appreciation and positive sentiment. Solana is showing strong momentum and is a top candidate for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is potential for institutional interest due to ETF speculation, the current price action and on-chain activity remain subdued. A cautious positive outlook is warranted.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets. The current market conditions favor reducing USDT exposure."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled optimism across the crypto space. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also experienced positive price movements, benefiting from the broader market rally. Dogecoin's potential for an ETF wrapper is generating speculative interest, while Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its ongoing utility in cross-network payments. Despite the bullish sentiment, the macroeconomic environment remains cautious with high interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar index, suggesting a balanced approach to risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news. Bitcoin's price surge and increased institutional interest make it an attractive asset in the current environment.

ETH: +0.6 — Benefiting from the broader market rally and positive price momentum. Ethereum's strong technical indicators and market optimism support increased allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Outperforming in the market upswing with significant price gains. Solana's strong technical signals and positive news sentiment justify a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest due to potential ETF developments, but low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm. Moderate increase in allocation to capture potential upside.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely. Maintaining some exposure for liquidity purposes, but reducing allocation to capitalize on bullish trends in other assets."
2025-01-30 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has led to a surge in Bitcoin's price and a broader crypto rally. Institutional interest is evident with significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, indicating renewed confidence. Ethereum and Solana are also benefiting from this positive sentiment, with Solana outperforming many competitors. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is gaining attention due to potential ETF developments, which could enhance its institutional appeal. Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network suggests a focus on improving cross-network payment efficiencies, though its role as a stablecoin may see reduced demand in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and significant ETF inflows suggest robust institutional interest and confidence in Bitcoin's upward trajectory.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and positive momentum, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's outperformance and strong technical indicators position it well within the current bullish market, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin's technical indicators are positive, the potential for ETF developments adds a speculative upside, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment with increasing risk appetite, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."
2025-01-30 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled optimism across the crypto space. Bitcoin has seen a notable price surge supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader market upswing, with Solana outperforming many of its peers. Dogecoin remains stable, with speculative discussions about potential ETF developments. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network suggests a focus on enhancing cross-network payment efficiency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with significant ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader crypto rally and maintains bullish technical indicators, supporting a positive allocation stance.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana has outperformed in the recent market upswing, showing strong price momentum and positive sentiment, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some speculative news, Dogecoin's low on-chain activity and lack of significant price movement suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2025-01-30 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has bolstered investor confidence and led to significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This has sparked a broader crypto rally, with assets like Ethereum and Solana experiencing notable price increases. The news of Tether's integration with the Bitcoin/Lightning network adds a positive development for USDT, although its impact on price stability is limited. The market is characterized by strong upward momentum across major cryptocurrencies, with institutional interest particularly evident in Bitcoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by significant ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news. This makes it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and shows strong technical indicators, making it a favorable asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana has outperformed in the recent market upswing, with strong technical signals and positive news, suggesting a high potential for continued gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has shown some positive movement and potential future ETF interest, its relative attractiveness is lower compared to other assets in the portfolio.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish market sentiment, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a reallocation of capital towards more volatile assets."
2025-01-30 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's pause on rate hikes, which has bolstered investor confidence and led to significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This has resulted in a rally across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana showing strong upward momentum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $105K, supported by renewed institutional demand. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader market rally, with Solana outperforming many of its peers. Dogecoin is experiencing speculative interest due to potential ETF developments, while USDT remains stable but less attractive in the current risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news. The price surge and increased on-chain activity further justify a higher allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Benefiting from the broader market rally and positive sentiment. The price increase and bullish momentum indicators suggest further upside potential.

SOL: +0.7 — Outperforming in the current market upswing with strong technical indicators and positive news, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest due to potential ETF developments provides a moderate buy signal, though it's less compelling than BTC, ETH, and SOL.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market in a risk-on mode, there's a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2025-01-30 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has boosted investor confidence and led to significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This has positively impacted Bitcoin's price, which has seen a rally above $105K. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader crypto rally, with Solana notably outperforming many competitors. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to speculation about potential ETF approval, which could enhance institutional interest. Meanwhile, Tether has expanded its presence by launching on the Bitcoin/Lightning network, aiming to improve cross-network payment efficiency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and a positive macroeconomic backdrop support Bitcoin's upward momentum. The recent price rally and increased on-chain activity further strengthen its appeal.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum benefits from the broader market rally and maintains bullish momentum. Its price increase and positive news sentiment support a moderate allocation increase.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's significant outperformance during the market upswing and strong technical indicators justify a favorable allocation. The asset shows strong momentum and investor interest.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation about potential ETF approval and bullish momentum provide a modest positive signal. However, the lack of immediate catalysts keeps the score moderate.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing USDT exposure is prudent to capitalize on the bullish market environment."
2025-01-30 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled optimism across the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also experienced price increases, benefiting from the broader market rally. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to speculation about potential ETF approval, which could enhance its institutional appeal. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its ongoing efforts to improve cross-network payment efficiency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, bolstered by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news. The surge in on-chain activity further supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and bullish momentum indicators. The positive sentiment from the Fed's decision adds to its appeal.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana has outperformed many competitors in the recent upswing, with strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment driving its attractiveness.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin's technical indicators are positive, the speculative nature of the ETF news warrants a cautious approach. The potential for institutional traction is a positive factor.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, maintaining high exposure to USDT is less attractive in the current bullish environment."
2025-01-30 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with the Federal Reserve's pause on rate hikes providing a boost to the crypto market. This has led to increased investor confidence and inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, signaling renewed institutional interest. Overall, the market sentiment is bullish, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana experiencing price increases. The news of Tether's launch on the Bitcoin/Lightning network further supports the utility and adoption of stablecoins, although the broader market rally suggests a shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is benefiting from strong ETF inflows and a positive macro environment. The pause in Fed rate hikes and increased institutional interest provide a solid foundation for continued growth.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is riding the wave of the broader crypto rally, with positive momentum and technical indicators supporting further gains. The market sentiment remains optimistic.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana is outperforming its peers in the current upswing, supported by strong price action and bullish news. Its technical indicators are also favorable.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin lacks immediate catalysts, the potential for ETF approval and its low correlation with other assets provide a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market leaning towards risk-on sentiment, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into higher-yielding assets."
2025-01-30 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has boosted investor confidence and led to a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a notable surge due to strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader market upswing, with Solana outperforming many of its peers. Dogecoin's potential for an ETF wrapper suggests growing institutional interest, although its on-chain activity remains low. Meanwhile, USDT's launch on the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its ongoing role in facilitating cross-network payments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and a positive macroeconomic backdrop support further gains. On-chain activity is robust, indicating strong market interest.

ETH: +0.5 — Benefiting from the broader market rally and positive momentum signals, though not as strong as Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.6 — Outperforming in the current rally with strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential ETF developments could drive future interest, but current on-chain activity is low, warranting a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2025-01-30 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's pause on rate hikes, which has led to increased investor confidence and inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This has positively impacted the broader crypto market, with assets like Ethereum and Solana experiencing notable price increases. Bitcoin is benefiting from strong institutional demand, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network suggests a push towards enhancing cross-network payment capabilities, although its stablecoin nature makes it less attractive in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum due to ETF inflows and renewed investor confidence following the Fed's pause on rate hikes. This makes it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally, with positive price momentum and bullish sentiment. While not as strong as Bitcoin, it remains a favorable asset to hold and slightly increase.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana has outperformed in the recent market upswing, showing strong price performance. Its positive momentum and market sentiment justify a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some speculative news about potential ETF developments, Dogecoin's technicals and on-chain activity remain relatively stable, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — In a bullish market environment, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on the upward momentum in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled investor confidence and led to a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen significant inflows into ETFs, indicating strong institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader market upswing, with Solana notably outperforming its peers. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to speculation about potential ETF approval, which could enhance its institutional appeal. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its ongoing efforts to improve cross-network payments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by significant ETF inflows and a positive price response to macroeconomic developments. The bullish sentiment is further supported by technical indicators.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the overall market optimism and has shown a steady price increase. The technical indicators remain supportive, although not as strong as Bitcoin's.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana has outperformed during the recent market upswing, and the positive news sentiment combined with technical buy signals suggests continued strength.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin's technical indicators are mixed, the potential for ETF approval could drive future institutional interest, warranting a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish market environment, there is a shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for holding stablecoins like USDT."
2025-01-30 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has led to a positive reaction in the crypto market. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience with strong ETF inflows and price increases, respectively. Solana has outperformed its peers in the recent upswing, indicating strong market interest. Meanwhile, Dogecoin's potential for an ETF wrapper suggests increasing institutional interest. Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its strategic growth in cross-network payments. Despite the positive sentiment, the market remains vigilant, with macroeconomic indicators such as the high U.S. Dollar Index and stable volatility levels suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive news sentiment support a bullish outlook, despite mixed technical signals. The macroeconomic context is also favorable for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.5 — While technical indicators are mixed, the broader market optimism and recent price increase justify a moderately positive stance.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's outperformance in the recent market upswing and positive news sentiment warrant a strong buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculation about potential ETF approval provides some upside potential, but technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive market sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2025-01-31 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.43. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which could pressure risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin faces headwinds from geopolitical tensions and tariff announcements, which have stalled its recent rally. Ethereum shows signs of strength, breaking key resistance levels, driven by increased stablecoin activity and ETF demand. Solana is gaining momentum with bullish technicals and strong app revenue growth, while Dogecoin sees increased derivatives activity and investment interest, potentially setting the stage for a rally. Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its network capabilities with Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a buy signal from moving averages, geopolitical tensions and potential volatility spikes suggest caution. Hold current position.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking resistance and strong fundamentals from stablecoin adoption provide a positive outlook. Consider increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish technicals and strong revenue growth support a positive allocation. Potential for further gains toward $250.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products indicate growing interest. Moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive sentiment in other assets, consider reducing stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital into higher-growth opportunities."
2025-01-31 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with some bullish signals emerging, particularly for Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum is showing signs of strength with a potential breakout towards $4,000, fueled by stablecoin adoption and ETF demand. Solana is also gaining momentum, with analysts projecting significant upside due to increased app revenues. Bitcoin, however, faces headwinds from geopolitical developments such as new tariffs, which have dampened its recent rally. Dogecoin is seeing increased interest from institutional investors, as evidenced by Grayscale's new trust and rising derivatives activity, though technical indicators remain mixed. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its utility through the Lightning Network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some technical signals suggesting potential for a big move, the recent tariff news has introduced uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong technical and fundamental factors, including breaking key resistance levels and increased stablecoin activity, suggest further upside potential.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive momentum and revenue growth support a bullish outlook, with potential for further gains as it targets $250.

DOGE: +0.2 — Institutional interest and rising derivatives activity provide some support, but technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — While regulatory challenges are present, the integration with the Lightning Network suggests potential utility growth; however, the overall market sentiment favors risk assets over stablecoins."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility and uncertainty, with the U.S. dollar index remaining strong and the S&P 500 showing stability. Bitcoin faces headwinds due to new tariffs affecting market sentiment, while Ethereum shows potential for a breakout driven by increased stablecoin activity. Solana is gaining momentum with positive news on app revenues and technical support levels, making it an attractive asset. Dogecoin is experiencing increased interest due to new investment products and derivatives activity, although its price remains relatively stable. Tether is under pressure from regulatory changes in Europe, but plans for integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent tariff news and low on-chain activity suggest potential downside risk, with volatility indicating a possible large movement. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive news regarding resistance levels and stablecoin adoption supports a moderate increase in allocation, as ETH shows potential for upward momentum.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong technical support and bullish news on app revenues suggest a favorable environment for SOL, warranting an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While derivatives activity and new investment products are positive, the price remains stable. A slight increase in allocation is justified by the potential for a breakout.

USDT: -0.2 — With potential bullish movements in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is advisable to capitalize on risk-on sentiment, despite regulatory pressures in Europe."
2025-01-31 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a relatively stable U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish market sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing a period of low volatility, hinting at a potential significant price movement, though recent news of tariffs has dampened its rally. Ethereum shows signs of strength, driven by stablecoin adoption and a potential breakout towards $4,000. Solana is gaining momentum with strong app revenues, while Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity, indicating speculative interest. USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, though its integration with the Lightning Network could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite potential for a big move, recent tariff news and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Holding current position is prudent.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive news on stablecoin adoption and potential breakout above key resistance levels make ETH relatively attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and strong app revenues support a modest increase in allocation, though technical signals remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased derivatives activity and Grayscale's new trust indicate growing interest, warranting a slight positive bias.

USDT: 0.0 — Regulatory challenges in Europe offset by potential benefits from Lightning Network integration. Maintain current exposure as a hedge against volatility."
2025-01-31 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which may exert pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a period of low volatility, suggesting a potential for significant price movement, while recent tariffs have dampened its rally. Ethereum shows signs of strength, driven by stablecoin adoption and technical resistance breakthroughs, indicating potential for further gains. Solana is gaining momentum with increased app revenues, and analysts are optimistic about its price trajectory. Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity and institutional interest, hinting at potential price rallies. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its utility with Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite potential for a big move, the recent tariff news and low volatility suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and strong news sentiment around stablecoin adoption and potential price breakout make ETH attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish news and technical indicators, along with increased app revenues, support a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Rising derivatives activity and institutional interest provide a bullish backdrop, suggesting a potential for price appreciation.

USDT: 0.0 — While regulatory challenges exist, the planned Lightning Network integration could enhance its utility. Maintain current holdings as a risk management tool."
2025-01-31 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a relatively stable U.S. dollar and moderate volatility in the equity markets, as indicated by the VIX. Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin facing headwinds from new tariffs and low volatility suggesting potential for a significant move. Ethereum is showing resilience, breaking above key resistance levels with support from the stablecoin ecosystem. Solana is regaining momentum with bullish targets, and Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity, hinting at potential rallies. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in the EU but plans for Lightning Network integration could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is experiencing pressure from macroeconomic developments and low volatility, suggesting potential downside risk. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong technical position and positive news about stablecoin adoption and potential ETF demand support an increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's bullish momentum and positive news about app revenues and potential price targets make it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and positive sentiment from the Grayscale trust introduction suggest potential for upside, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains a safe haven, the regulatory challenges in the EU and positive sentiment in other assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with some assets showing potential for upward movement. Bitcoin faces headwinds due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs, which have dampened its recent rally. However, technical indicators suggest a significant price movement could be on the horizon. Ethereum is showing strength, breaking key resistance levels and benefiting from the stablecoin ecosystem's growth. Solana is gaining momentum with bullish news and increased app revenues, suggesting a potential rally. Dogecoin is experiencing increased derivatives activity and investment interest, which could lead to a price breakout. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its utility with planned integration into the Bitcoin Lightning Network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite potential for a big move, current geopolitical tensions and lack of strong buy signals suggest a cautious hold.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking key resistance and benefiting from stablecoin growth, ETH shows strong potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news on app revenues and bullish technical indicators support a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products suggest potential for a rally, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With regulatory pressures and a generally optimistic market sentiment, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2025-01-31 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, which suggests a relatively neutral backdrop for risk assets. However, the recent introduction of tariffs by the U.S. has created some uncertainty, particularly affecting Bitcoin's recent rally. Ethereum shows promising signs of breaking key resistance levels, driven by increased demand for stablecoins and potential ETF-related momentum. Solana is gaining traction with bullish technical indicators and increased app revenues, while Dogecoin is experiencing heightened interest due to new investment products and rising derivatives activity. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its technological reach with planned Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent tariff news has dampened Bitcoin's rally, and with no clear bullish technical signals, a cautious reduction is warranted.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is showing strong potential for a breakout above $3,300, supported by positive news on stablecoin adoption and ETF demand.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's bullish reversal and increased app revenues suggest a strong upward trajectory, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — The launch of a new investment trust and increased derivatives activity indicate potential for a price rally, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.2 — While regulatory challenges in the EU are a concern, the planned Lightning Network integration could enhance its utility, justifying a slight reduction in favor of more growth-oriented assets."
2025-01-31 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which can exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a period of low volatility, suggesting a potential large movement ahead, but recent tariffs have hindered its rally. Ethereum shows signs of strength, breaking key resistance levels with positive news on ETF demand and stablecoin adoption. Solana is also gaining momentum, supported by increased app revenues and bullish price targets. Dogecoin is seeing increased interest due to new investment products and rising derivatives activity, though its price remains relatively stable. USDT faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its network capabilities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite potential for a big move, current macroeconomic pressures and tariff news create uncertainty. Maintaining a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technicals and strong news on ETF demand and stablecoin adoption suggest potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and positive revenue news support a favorable outlook, with potential for price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products boost sentiment, though price movement remains limited.

USDT: -0.3 — Regulatory challenges in Europe and a shift towards riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2025-01-31 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index. Bitcoin is experiencing a pullback due to geopolitical trade tensions, while Ethereum is showing signs of strength with potential for further gains driven by stablecoin adoption and ETF demand. Solana is regaining momentum with bullish technicals and increased app revenues, suggesting potential for further upside. Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity and investment interest, which could lead to a rally. USDT faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its reach with planned Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent news of tariffs and low on-chain activity suggest potential downside risk, despite low volatility hinting at a possible big move. Reducing exposure is prudent given current holdings.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking key resistance levels and strong news support from stablecoin adoption and ETF interest make ETH attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish technicals and strong app revenue growth support a positive outlook, warranting increased exposure as it targets higher price levels.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products offer potential upside, but current holdings suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — While facing regulatory challenges in Europe, its integration into the Lightning Network may enhance utility. Maintaining current exposure is advisable given the mixed signals."
2025-01-31 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 16.43. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong at 108.37, which could exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Recent market data shows a lack of strong bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies, with technical indicators generally pointing to neutral or bearish trends. However, news summaries suggest potential bullish developments for Ethereum and Solana, driven by structural factors such as ETF demand and app revenue growth, respectively. Bitcoin faces headwinds from geopolitical tensions affecting its rally, while Dogecoin sees increased interest from institutional investors through new investment products.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite potential for a large move due to low volatility, recent geopolitical news and lack of technical buy signals suggest caution. Holding a small position is prudent given current uncertainties.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive news on breaking key resistance levels and stablecoin ecosystem growth supports a bullish outlook. Current technicals are mixed, but the potential for further gains justifies increased exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish news on price targets and app revenue growth, combined with a recent price rebound, indicates a favorable environment for SOL. While technicals are neutral, the news-driven momentum supports a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products provide a slight bullish tilt. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a cautious but positive stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish developments in other cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin holdings to capitalize on risk asset opportunities is advisable. However, maintaining some USDT is prudent given macroeconomic uncertainties."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows stability with a moderate U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a relatively calm market. However, the recent imposition of tariffs by the U.S. has introduced some uncertainty, particularly affecting Bitcoin's recent rally. Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum, breaking key resistance levels, and is supported by increased stablecoin activity on its network. Solana is also gaining traction with positive price movements and increased app-generated revenue, while Dogecoin is experiencing heightened interest due to new investment products and rising derivatives activity. USDT remains stable, but regulatory changes in Europe and new technological integrations are noteworthy.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the potential for a significant price movement due to low volatility, the recent tariff news introduces uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and breaking key resistance levels, coupled with positive news on stablecoin adoption, make ETH an attractive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price momentum and increased app revenue suggest further upside potential, supporting a moderately bullish allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products indicate potential for a rally, justifying a cautious positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With a bullish sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure to allocate more capital into riskier assets is advisable."
2025-01-31 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar index, which could exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing low volatility, suggesting a potential for a significant price movement soon, although recent tariffs have dampened its rally. Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum, breaking key resistance levels and benefiting from increased stablecoin activity. Solana is also gaining momentum, with potential upside driven by increased app revenues. Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity and positive sentiment due to new investment products. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite low volatility hinting at a potential big move, the recent tariff news and lack of strong bullish signals suggest a neutral stance for now.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and breaking key resistance levels, coupled with positive news around stablecoin adoption, make ETH attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive momentum and potential for further gains towards $250, supported by increased app revenues, justify a moderately bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Rising derivatives activity and positive sentiment from new investment products suggest potential upside, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals in other assets and regulatory challenges in Europe, reducing USDT exposure to allocate more capital into riskier assets is advisable."
2025-01-31 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Ethereum showing strong bullish momentum, driven by both technical indicators and positive news regarding its ecosystem. Bitcoin, however, faces headwinds due to geopolitical factors like new tariffs, which have dampened its recent rally. Solana is gaining traction with a bullish reversal and increased app revenues, suggesting potential for further gains. Dogecoin is experiencing heightened interest due to new investment products and increased derivatives activity, indicating potential for a rally. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, though regulatory challenges in the EU could impact its usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a potential for a big move due to low volatility, the negative impact of new tariffs and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news about its ecosystem and resistance breakouts make ETH a highly attractive asset currently.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish reversal and increased app revenues provide a positive outlook, suggesting potential for further gains towards the $250 mark.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products indicate growing interest and potential for a rally, though with some caution due to its volatile nature.

USDT: 0.0 — Regulatory challenges in the EU and stablecoin nature suggest maintaining current exposure without significant changes."
2025-01-31 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed backdrop for cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Dollar Index is high, indicating potential pressure on risk assets, while the S&P 500 remains strong, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment. Volatility is moderate, which may imply stable trading conditions. Bitcoin is experiencing a pullback due to geopolitical tensions, while Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum, buoyed by positive news and technical indicators. Solana is also gaining traction, with positive technical signals and strong app revenue growth. Dogecoin is seeing increased interest due to new investment products and rising derivatives activity. USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in the EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite potential for a large move, current geopolitical tensions and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current holdings.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding stablecoin adoption and potential price breakout make ETH highly attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive technical signals and strong app revenue growth support a moderate increase in allocation, with potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Rising derivatives activity and new investment products provide a supportive backdrop for DOGE, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment in other assets and regulatory challenges, reducing USDT exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in risk assets."

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility in the S&P 500 and a strong U.S. dollar index. This stability is mirrored in the crypto market, where Ethereum and Dogecoin show strong bullish momentum, supported by positive news and technical indicators. Ethereum is benefiting from increased stablecoin adoption and breaking key resistance levels, while Dogecoin is buoyed by increased derivatives activity and new investment products. Solana is also showing signs of recovery with a potential target of $250. Bitcoin, however, faces headwinds from geopolitical tensions affecting its rally, despite technical indicators suggesting a potential large move. USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in the EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite potential for a big move, geopolitical tensions and lack of clear bullish signals suggest a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding stablecoin adoption and resistance breakouts make ETH attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish reversal and positive news about app revenues support a moderate increase in allocation, with a potential target of $250.

DOGE: +0.6 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products provide a bullish outlook, warranting a higher allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is appropriate."
2025-01-31 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could exert some pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is facing headwinds due to geopolitical tensions and new tariffs, which have stalled its recent rally. However, Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum, driven by technical breakouts and increased demand for stablecoins on its network. Solana is also gaining traction, with positive news on app revenues and technical indicators suggesting a potential rally. Dogecoin is experiencing increased interest due to new investment products and rising derivatives activity, indicating potential for a breakout. USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, although its planned integration with the Lightning Network could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite some bullish technical signals, the recent news of tariffs and potential volatility suggest a cautious approach. Maintain current exposure without increasing allocation.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding resistance breakouts and stablecoin adoption make ETH an attractive asset for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and news of increased app revenues provide a supportive backdrop for Solana, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Rising derivatives activity and new investment products indicate potential for a rally, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — While USDT remains stable, the regulatory challenges in Europe and overall bullish sentiment in other assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital to more promising opportunities."
2025-01-31 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which generally exerts downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. However, within the crypto market, there are signs of bullish momentum, particularly for Ethereum and Solana, driven by strong technical indicators and positive news flow. Ethereum is benefiting from increased demand due to stablecoin adoption and potential ETF developments, while Solana is seeing a resurgence in momentum and app revenue growth. Bitcoin faces headwinds from geopolitical developments, but a potential large move is hinted at by reduced volatility. Dogecoin is experiencing heightened speculation due to new investment products and increased derivatives activity. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.3** — Despite geopolitical headwinds, the potential for a significant price move due to low volatility and recent bullish momentum suggests a cautious increase in allocation.

**ETH: +0.8** — Strong technical indicators, coupled with positive news regarding stablecoin adoption and ETF demand, make ETH highly attractive for capital allocation.

**SOL: +0.6** — Bullish momentum and positive news about app revenue growth support a favorable outlook, with potential for further price appreciation.

**DOGE: +0.4** — Increased derivatives activity and positive sentiment from new investment products suggest a moderate increase in allocation, despite recent price volatility.

**USDT: -0.5** — With bullish sentiment across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2025-01-31 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.43. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which could exert downward pressure on crypto assets. Recent market data reveals mixed signals across cryptocurrencies, with some assets experiencing significant price fluctuations. Bitcoin's recent rally has been interrupted by geopolitical developments, while Ethereum continues to show strength, driven by increasing demand for stablecoins and potential ETF interest. Solana is gaining momentum with strong on-chain activity and bullish price targets, while Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity and institutional interest. Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its reach through the Lightning Network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite previous bullish momentum, recent geopolitical news and a breakdown in technical indicators suggest caution. The potential for a larger move is noted, but current sentiment is bearish.

**ETH: +0.6** — Ethereum is showing strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment, with potential for further gains driven by stablecoin adoption and ETF interest.

**SOL: +0.5** — Solana is experiencing a bullish reversal and strong on-chain activity, with positive news suggesting further upside potential.

**DOGE: +0.2** — Increased derivatives activity and institutional interest provide a modestly bullish outlook, though the asset remains volatile.

**USDT: 0.0** — Regulatory challenges in Europe are balanced by expansion plans on the Lightning Network. Current market conditions suggest maintaining a neutral position in stablecoins."
2025-01-31 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. However, the U.S. dollar index remains high, which could exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Recent market data reveals a mixed picture: BTC and SOL are experiencing technical breakdowns, while ETH shows resilience with bullish momentum and positive news. DOGE is gaining traction due to increased derivatives activity and new investment products, while USDT faces regulatory challenges in Europe but plans for integration with the Lightning Network. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward movements in ETH and DOGE, while BTC and SOL face short-term pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, BTC is experiencing a technical breakdown and faces macroeconomic headwinds from new tariffs, suggesting a cautious reduction in exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — ETH is showing strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding stablecoin adoption and potential price breakout, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — While SOL has faced recent technical breakdowns, positive news about app revenues and a potential price target provide some support for a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Rising derivatives activity and the launch of a new investment trust are boosting sentiment, suggesting potential for a rally, warranting an increased allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With regulatory challenges in Europe but potential integration with the Lightning Network, USDT remains a neutral hold as a stable component of the portfolio."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some assets showing potential for upward movement while others face headwinds. Bitcoin is experiencing a pullback due to new tariffs affecting its recent rally, with volatility suggesting a potential large move. Ethereum is showing strength, breaking key resistance levels and benefiting from stablecoin adoption. Solana is regaining momentum with bullish targets, supported by strong app revenues. Dogecoin is gaining interest with increased derivatives activity and new investment products, indicating potential for a rally. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its network capabilities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Bitcoin is under pressure from macroeconomic factors such as tariffs, and its recent volatility suggests uncertainty. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is showing strong technical signals and benefits from increased stablecoin activity, suggesting further potential for upward movement.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is showing signs of a bullish reversal and strong app revenue growth, making it attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products are supportive, but the market remains speculative, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite regulatory challenges, USDT remains a stable asset in the portfolio. No change in allocation is recommended as it provides a hedge against market volatility."
2025-01-31 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is marked by a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, suggesting a cautious risk sentiment. Bitcoin is facing headwinds due to geopolitical tensions and new tariffs, which have stalled its recent rally. Ethereum, however, is showing resilience with bullish momentum driven by increased stablecoin adoption and breaking key resistance levels. Solana is also gaining traction with strong app revenues and a bullish reversal, while Dogecoin is seeing increased interest due to new investment products and rising derivatives activity. USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, although its planned integration with the Lightning Network could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent geopolitical news and technical indicators suggest potential downside risk. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong technical signals and positive news regarding stablecoin adoption support a bullish stance. Increasing allocation is justified.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish reversal and strong app revenue growth indicate potential upside. A moderate increase in allocation is recommended.

DOGE: +0.3 — Rising derivatives activity and new investment products suggest potential for a rally. A slight increase in allocation is warranted.

USDT: 0.0 — While regulatory challenges exist, its stability and upcoming Lightning Network integration provide a balanced outlook. Maintain current exposure."
2025-01-31 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and no extreme movements in major indices. Bitcoin is experiencing a pullback due to geopolitical tensions and tariff announcements, suggesting potential volatility ahead. Ethereum is showing signs of strength with a potential breakout on the horizon, driven by increased demand for ETFs and stablecoin activity. Solana is gaining momentum with positive technical indicators and strong app revenue performance, hinting at further upside potential. Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity and institutional interest, which could drive a rally. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its utility through integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Current geopolitical tensions and a lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Maintain exposure but be prepared for potential volatility.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news regarding ETF demand and stablecoin growth make ETH an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive momentum and strong app revenue performance indicate potential upside, making it a favorable asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Rising derivatives activity and institutional interest provide a supportive backdrop for potential gains, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.2 — While regulatory challenges in Europe are a concern, the planned Lightning Network integration adds utility. Maintain a slightly reduced allocation as risk appetite increases."
2025-01-31 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with a relatively low VIX, indicating reduced market volatility. However, the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. President has triggered a market-wide pullback, affecting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a dip, while Ethereum has shown resilience with a recent rally above the $3,300 mark. Solana is experiencing increased stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound off key support levels, suggesting renewed interest and activity. Dogecoin remains range-bound with speculative discussions about its path to $1, while Tether is facing regulatory challenges in the EEA due to upcoming MiCA regulations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. While holding a small position, reducing exposure is prudent given the current market sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent rally above $3,300 and consistent buy signals from trend indicators suggest a positive outlook. Increasing exposure aligns with its relative strength in the market.

SOL: +0.3 — The rebound from key support and significant stablecoin inflows indicate potential upside. A moderate increase in allocation is justified by the positive sentiment and technical outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative discussions and AI forecasts, Dogecoin lacks clear directional signals and remains range-bound. Maintaining current exposure is appropriate.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains a stable asset, the overall market sentiment and regulatory challenges suggest a slight reduction in exposure to free up capital for more promising opportunities."
2025-02-01 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. President, which has triggered a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been affected, dipping to around $100,000. Ethereum, however, shows resilience with a recent rally above $3,300. Solana is witnessing a potential rebound off a critical support level, bolstered by significant stablecoin inflows. Dogecoin remains range-bound, with discussions around its potential path to $1, contingent on breaking key resistance levels. Meanwhile, Tether's strong financial performance is overshadowed by regulatory challenges in the EEA, as Kraken plans to delist it ahead of MiCA regulations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the recent dip due to macroeconomic factors, the lack of bullish technical indicators and low on-chain activity suggest a cautious stance. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent rally above $3,300 and consistent buy signals from trend indicators make it relatively attractive, warranting an increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from key support levels provide a bullish outlook, justifying a modest increase in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in technical indicators or sentiment, and given its range-bound nature, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.2 — While regulatory challenges exist, the stablecoin's strong financials and current market uncertainty justify maintaining a slightly reduced but still significant allocation as a hedge."
2025-02-01 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, with the U.S. imposing tariffs leading to a broader market pullback. Bitcoin has seen a dip due to these macroeconomic pressures, while Ethereum has shown resilience, breaking above the $3,300 mark. Solana is experiencing a potential rebound, supported by increased stablecoin inflows and DEX activity. Dogecoin remains range-bound, with discussions around its potential to reach $1 if it can break key resistance levels. Tether continues to demonstrate strong financial performance, although regulatory changes in the EEA may impact its market presence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent sell-off triggered by macroeconomic factors suggests caution. Despite holding a small amount, the lack of bullish technical signals warrants a slight reduction.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent price surge and positive news sentiment indicate a favorable outlook, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

SOL: +0.6 — With bullish momentum signals and significant stablecoin inflows, Solana shows potential for growth, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some positive sentiment, Dogecoin remains range-bound with no clear technical or fundamental catalysts to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.2 — In light of market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against potential downside risks."
2025-02-01 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs, while Ethereum has shown resilience, breaking above the $3,300 mark. Solana is witnessing increased stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from key support levels, suggesting a mixed outlook. Dogecoin remains range-bound with speculative discussions around its potential to reach $1, though it faces resistance. Tether's recent profit announcement and increased issuance are overshadowed by regulatory challenges in the EEA, impacting its demand dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate downside risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technicals, Ethereum's recent price rally and positive news sentiment provide a moderately favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from key support levels indicate a positive short-term outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative discussions, Dogecoin remains range-bound with no clear directional bias, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and regulatory concerns, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against potential downside in risk assets."
2025-02-01 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a slight bearish tilt, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as increased tariffs imposed by the U.S., which have led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been affected, dropping to around $100,000, while Ethereum has shown resilience, breaking above $3,300. Solana is seeing a potential rebound from key support levels, and increased stablecoin inflows suggest growing DEX activity. Dogecoin is trading within a narrow range, with discussions around its path to $1, while Tether remains stable despite regulatory challenges in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of bullish technical indicators suggest a cautious stance, with potential for further downside.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, Ethereum's recent price rally above $3,300 and positive news sentiment provide a moderately bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from key support levels indicate a favorable environment for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — Trading within a narrow range with no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and regulatory developments, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT for stability is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. dollar, which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. have triggered a broad market pullback, affecting Bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin has experienced a dip, while Ethereum has shown some resilience with a slight rally. Solana is seeing increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting potential bullish momentum, while Dogecoin remains range-bound with speculative discussions about its path to higher resistance levels. Tether's robust issuance and profit reports are juxtaposed with regulatory challenges in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent sell-off triggered by geopolitical tensions and tariffs suggests caution. Despite a slight price recovery, the overall sentiment remains bearish, and technical indicators do not support a buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's recent price rally above $3,300 and positive news sentiment provide a modest bullish outlook, though technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — The significant stablecoin inflows and bullish sentiment from traders suggest potential upward momentum. Solana's rebound at a key support level adds to its attractiveness.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative discussions about its future price path, Dogecoin remains range-bound with no clear technical or fundamental catalysts to justify a directional bias.

USDT: +0.1 — While USDT is generally a safe haven in uncertain times, the regulatory news from Kraken and the strong dollar environment suggest a cautious approach. However, its stability remains attractive amidst market volatility."
2025-02-01 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautious with a slight bearish tilt, influenced by macroeconomic pressures such as new tariffs imposed by the U.S., which have triggered a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has dipped to around $100,000, reflecting this broader risk-off sentiment. Ethereum shows some resilience, having recently crossed the $3,300 mark, though its technical indicators remain neutral. Solana is experiencing a potential rebound after hitting a key support level, with increased stablecoin inflows suggesting growing interest in its ecosystem. Dogecoin remains range-bound, with discussions around its potential to reach $1, contingent on breaking through significant resistance levels. Meanwhile, Tether continues to show strength with substantial profits and issuance, although regulatory concerns in the EEA could impact its future utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach, especially given the current holdings.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite neutral technicals, Ethereum's recent price resilience and positive news about crossing $3,300 provide a slight bullish inclination.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from stablecoin inflows and technical support levels suggest potential upside, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some speculative interest, the lack of clear technical or news-driven catalysts keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the overall cautious market sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainties, maintaining a higher USDT allocation for stability is prudent."
2025-02-01 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious, with macroeconomic factors such as tariffs impacting Bitcoin and broader crypto markets negatively. Bitcoin has experienced a pullback due to geopolitical tensions, while Ethereum has shown some resilience, recently breaking above the $3,300 mark. Solana is attracting attention with increased stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from a key support level, indicating some bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains range-bound with speculative discussions around its potential to reach $1, though it faces resistance. Tether's strong financial performance is overshadowed by regulatory challenges in the EEA, which could affect its demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent tariff news has negatively impacted Bitcoin, and technical indicators do not suggest a bullish reversal. Reducing exposure seems prudent given the current macroeconomic headwinds.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's recent price rally and resilience above $3,300 provide a slightly positive outlook, though technicals remain neutral. A modest increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana shows potential for a rebound with increased stablecoin inflows and positive sentiment from traders. This suggests a favorable environment for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative discussions, Dogecoin remains range-bound with no clear bullish signals. Maintaining current exposure is appropriate.

USDT: +0.1 — While regulatory challenges exist, USDT's strong financials and the current cautious market sentiment justify maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation for risk management."
2025-02-01 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin has dipped to around $100,000, reflecting broader market concerns. Ethereum, however, has shown some resilience, breaking above $3,300, supported by positive news from Binance. Solana is experiencing a potential rebound after hitting a key support level, with increased stablecoin inflows suggesting growing DEX activity. Dogecoin remains range-bound, with discussions around its potential path to $1. Tether's strong issuance and profit reports are overshadowed by regulatory challenges in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite high on-chain activity, the recent price dip due to macroeconomic pressures and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.2 — The recent price surge above $3,300 and positive news provide a modestly bullish outlook, though technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.4 — The rebound from a key support level and significant stablecoin inflows indicate potential for upward movement, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in technicals or sentiment, Dogecoin remains neutral, especially given its range-bound trading.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market uncertainty and regulatory challenges, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation for risk management is prudent."
2025-02-01 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, with the CBOE Volatility Index at 17.16, indicating a moderate level of market uncertainty. The recent imposition of tariffs by the U.S. President has triggered a sell-off, impacting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a notable decline, trading around $100,000, while Ethereum has experienced a slight rally, crossing the $3,300 mark. Solana shows potential for a rebound after hitting a key support level, and there is a significant increase in stablecoin inflows into its ecosystem. Dogecoin is trading within a narrow range, with discussions around its potential to reach $1. Tether remains stable, although regulatory changes in the EEA could impact its future trading environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — The recent sell-off due to tariff news and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach. Given the current holding, reducing exposure slightly is prudent.

**ETH: +0.2** — Despite the recent rally above $3,300, technical indicators remain neutral. However, the positive news and slight upward momentum warrant a modest increase in allocation.

**SOL: +0.5** — The potential rebound from a key support level and increased stablecoin inflows indicate a positive outlook. This, combined with the current market sentiment, supports a higher allocation.

**DOGE: -0.1** — Trading within a narrow range with no clear bullish signals. The potential for a future ETF could be positive, but current conditions suggest maintaining a slightly reduced position.

**USDT: +0.2** — In light of the current market volatility and potential regulatory impacts on other assets, maintaining a stable position in USDT is advisable for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautious, with macroeconomic pressures such as tariffs impacting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant pullback due to these tariffs, dragging down its price to around $100,000. Ethereum has shown some resilience, breaking above $3,300, but overall technical indicators remain weak across the board. Solana shows potential for a rebound after hitting a key support level, supported by increased stablecoin inflows and DEX activity. Dogecoin remains range-bound with no clear bullish signals, while Tether maintains strong fundamentals but faces regulatory challenges in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — The recent sell-off due to tariff news and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution, but no current holdings mean no reduction is possible.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite recent price resilience, technical indicators are not supportive. However, holding a position allows for a slight positive bias based on recent price strength.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news around stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from key support levels justify a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: -0.1 — With current holdings, the lack of bullish momentum and range-bound trading suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and macroeconomic pressures, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-02-01 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures, such as tariffs imposed by the U.S. on key trading partners, which have contributed to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has seen a notable dip, while Ethereum has shown some resilience with a recent rally above $3,300. Solana is experiencing a potential rebound after hitting a key support level, bolstered by increased stablecoin inflows. Dogecoin is trading within a narrow range, with discussions around its potential to reach higher resistance levels. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in the EEA, which could impact its usage in that region.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent dip due to macroeconomic factors, Bitcoin's price remains relatively stable within the Bollinger Bands. No immediate buy or sell signals are evident, suggesting a hold position.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's recent rally above $3,300 and normal on-chain activity indicate a slight bullish sentiment. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's bounce off a key support level and significant stablecoin inflows suggest potential bullish momentum. This, combined with increased DEX activity, supports a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's price remains within a tight range with no clear bullish signals, and low on-chain activity suggests a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and regulatory developments in the EEA, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation for risk management is advisable."
2025-02-01 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment shows a mixed picture, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar index, which might put pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The recent imposition of tariffs by the U.S. has triggered a market-wide pullback, affecting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a slight recovery in the last hour, but the overall sentiment remains cautious. Ethereum has shown resilience, breaking above the $3,300 mark, supported by positive news. Solana is experiencing increased stablecoin inflows and has rebounded from a key support level, indicating potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin remains range-bound, with discussions around its potential path to higher resistance levels. Tether continues to show strength in issuance and profits, although regulatory challenges in the EEA could impact its usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent pullbacks due to macroeconomic factors, Bitcoin's slight recovery and on-chain activity suggest cautious optimism. The market remains wary, but BTC's resilience is notable.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent price surge above $3,300 and stable on-chain activity provide a positive outlook. The asset appears to be gaining momentum, warranting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's rebound from a key support level and significant stablecoin inflows signal potential bullish momentum. The increased DEX activity further supports a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin remains range-bound with no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators. The potential for a move towards $1 is speculative at this stage.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains stable, the overall market conditions suggest a slight rotation into riskier assets like ETH and SOL. Regulatory concerns in the EEA may also impact its attractiveness."
2025-02-01 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2025-02-01 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, as evidenced by the elevated CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) at 17.16, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) at 108.58, which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has faced a significant sell-off due to geopolitical tensions and tariff impositions, leading to a dip below $100,000. Ethereum, however, has shown resilience with a recent rally above $3,300, suggesting a potential decoupling from Bitcoin's bearish sentiment. Solana is experiencing a positive influx of stablecoins, indicating increased decentralized exchange (DEX) activity and potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin remains range-bound, with speculative discussions about its path to $1. Tether's strong financial performance is overshadowed by regulatory challenges in the EEA, affecting its future stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent macroeconomic pressures and tariff-related sell-off have led to bearish sentiment. Despite some bullish momentum signals, the overall market environment is not supportive of a strong recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's recent price rally and resilience above $3,300 suggest potential for further gains, especially with positive news from Binance. However, technical indicators remain mixed, warranting cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.6 — The surge in stablecoin inflows and positive news about support levels indicate potential bullish momentum. Increased DEX activity further supports a favorable outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative discussions about its potential path to $1, Dogecoin remains range-bound with no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market volatility and geopolitical uncertainties, maintaining a stablecoin position provides a hedge. However, regulatory challenges in the EEA may limit its attractiveness."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across different assets. Bitcoin has experienced a pullback due to macroeconomic factors such as tariffs, but it maintains bullish momentum in the short term. Ethereum has shown resilience with a recent rally, indicating potential upward movement. Solana is showing signs of recovery after hitting a critical support level, bolstered by increased stablecoin inflows and DEX activity. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with speculative discussions around potential growth, while Tether continues to be a safe haven amidst regulatory changes in the EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip due to tariffs, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and strong on-chain activity suggest a cautious buy, though macroeconomic risks remain.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent rally above $3,300 and stable on-chain activity indicate a positive outlook, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's rebound from key support and significant stablecoin inflows suggest strong potential for upward movement, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price remains stable with no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators, justifying a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential growth opportunities."
2025-02-01 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index. Recent market data reflects a mixed sentiment across cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin experiencing a dip due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs, while Ethereum shows some resilience with a recent rally. Solana has potential bullish momentum after bouncing off a key support level, supported by increased stablecoin inflows. Dogecoin remains range-bound with speculative discussions on its path to $1. Tether continues to demonstrate strong issuance and profitability, though regulatory challenges in the EEA may affect its future.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent sell-off due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs suggests caution. Despite bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic environment and news sentiment are not supportive of a strong buy.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's recent rally and breaking above $3,300 show potential, but technical indicators remain neutral. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and a rebound from key support suggest potential for upward movement. Increased DEX activity is also supportive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative discussions and AI forecasts, there is no clear directional signal. The asset remains range-bound without significant news impact.

USDT: +0.1 — While regulatory concerns in the EEA exist, Tether's strong issuance and profitability provide a stable backdrop. A slight increase in allocation is prudent given the current market uncertainty."
2025-02-01 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a pullback due to macroeconomic factors like tariffs, which have affected broader market sentiment. Ethereum shows some resilience with a recent price rally, while Solana has seen a rebound from key support levels and increased stablecoin inflows, indicating potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin remains range-bound with speculative discussions about its path to higher resistance levels. Meanwhile, Tether's strong financial performance is overshadowed by regulatory challenges in the EEA, which could impact its utility in that region.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent tariff-related sell-off and lack of a strong buy signal suggest caution. Maintain some exposure but reduce slightly due to macroeconomic headwinds.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite mixed technicals, recent price rally and positive sentiment provide a modest buy signal. Maintain exposure with a slight increase.

SOL: +0.5 — Rebound from key support and significant stablecoin inflows indicate potential for upward movement. Increase exposure to capitalize on bullish momentum.

DOGE: 0.0 — Trading within a narrow range with no clear directional signals. Hold position as speculative sentiment remains unchanged.

USDT: +0.1 — Despite regulatory challenges, maintain a slight increase in USDT allocation for stability amidst broader market volatility."
2025-02-01 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a pullback due to macroeconomic factors such as tariffs, while Ethereum has shown resilience with a recent price surge. Solana is displaying signs of a potential rebound after hitting a critical support level, supported by increased stablecoin inflows. Dogecoin remains range-bound with discussions around its potential to reach higher resistance levels, though sentiment is cautious. Meanwhile, Tether continues to show strong issuance and profitability, but faces regulatory challenges in the EEA. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, with a strong U.S. dollar and moderate volatility, there is a cautious tone in the market, leading to a preference for stable assets like USDT in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent macroeconomic news and price pullback suggest caution. Holding a small position is prudent given current volatility.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's recent price surge and positive news provide a slight bullish bias, though technicals remain mixed. A modest increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound signal a stronger buy opportunity. Increasing exposure to capitalize on potential gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in technicals or sentiment, maintaining the current position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the macroeconomic uncertainty and potential regulatory impacts, maintaining a strong position in USDT provides stability and liquidity."

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as tariffs imposed by the U.S. President, which have triggered a sell-off across markets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has dipped significantly, dragging down altcoins as well. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, is experiencing technical weakness, while Solana shows potential for a rebound after hitting a key support level. Dogecoin remains range-bound with speculative discussions about its path to higher resistance levels. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in the EEA, which could impact its liquidity and usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic sell-off and recent price dip suggest caution. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent rally above $3,300 was short-lived, and technical indicators are weak. Reducing exposure could be prudent given the bearish market conditions.

SOL: +0.2 — Although Solana has seen a significant price decrease, the bounce off a key support and increased stablecoin inflows hint at potential recovery. A modest increase in allocation is warranted.

DOGE: -0.2 — With no significant bullish signals and a bearish market environment, reducing exposure slightly is advisable to manage downside risk.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is preferred for stability and liquidity, despite potential regulatory impacts in the EEA."
2025-02-01 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as the imposition of tariffs by the U.S., which has led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping to around $100,000. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, is showing signs of weakness with technical indicators suggesting potential breakdowns. Solana has shown some resilience, bouncing off a critical support level, and has seen increased stablecoin inflows, indicating potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin remains in a tight trading range with mixed forecasts, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in the EEA, although its issuance and profit reports remain strong.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic environment and recent news of tariffs have created downward pressure on Bitcoin. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum's recent rally is overshadowed by technical indicators suggesting a potential breakdown. Given the current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's bounce off a key support level and increased stablecoin inflows suggest potential bullish momentum. A slight increase in allocation is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin is trading within a narrow range with no clear directional signals from news or technical indicators. Maintain current holdings.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets and regulatory challenges, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."
2025-02-01 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as new tariffs imposed by the U.S., which have led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping to around $100,000. Ethereum, despite a brief rally, remains under pressure with no strong buy signals. Solana shows potential for a rebound due to increased stablecoin inflows and support at key price levels, but risks remain. Dogecoin is trading within a narrow range, with mixed forecasts and no clear breakout signals. Tether remains stable, though regulatory changes in the EEA could impact its future availability on certain platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the overall bearish macroeconomic environment and recent price drop suggest reducing exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent rally but no strong technical indicators for further gains; hold current position.

SOL: +0.3 — Potential for rebound with increased stablecoin inflows and support at key levels; cautiously optimistic.

DOGE: 0.0 — Trading within a narrow range with no clear breakout signals; maintain current position.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and potential regulatory impacts, increasing exposure to stablecoins offers a safer position."
2025-02-01 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as increased tariffs imposed by the U.S., which have led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dipping to around $100,000. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, remains under pressure with technical indicators showing a potential breakdown. Solana shows some positive signs with increased stablecoin inflows and a bounce off a key support level, but caution is advised. Dogecoin is trading within a narrow range, with potential upside if it can break through resistance levels. Tether remains stable, although regulatory changes in the EEA could impact its usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.4 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic environment and recent sell-off news suggest caution. Reducing exposure is prudent given current market conditions.

ETH: 0.0 — Recent rally above $3,300 is offset by technical breakdown signals and macroeconomic pressures. Holding position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and a bounce off key support provide some bullish sentiment. Moderate increase in exposure is justified.

DOGE: 0.0 — Trading within a narrow range with no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators. Maintain current position.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, increasing stablecoin exposure provides a safe haven. Regulatory concerns are noted but not immediately impactful."
2025-02-01 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. President, which has led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been dragged down to around $100,000, and altcoins have experienced heavier losses. Despite this, there are some positive developments, such as Ethereum's recent rally above $3,300 and Solana's potential rebound off a key support level. However, the technical indicators for most assets remain weak, with prices below their respective Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. Stablecoin inflows into Solana have spiked, suggesting increased activity on its network, while Tether continues to show strong financial performance despite regulatory challenges in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The bearish macroeconomic environment and recent price declines suggest reducing exposure, although on-chain activity remains robust.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, technical indicators are weak, and the price is below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating uncertainty.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive news about stablecoin inflows and potential rebound off key support provide a slightly bullish outlook, but caution is warranted due to overall market conditions.

DOGE: -0.1 — Modest decline and lack of strong technical or news-driven catalysts suggest maintaining a neutral to slightly reduced position.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as rising U.S. tariffs and global trade tensions, which have led to a significant sell-off in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, dropping below $95K, while Ethereum has also seen a substantial decrease of approximately 5.6%. Despite these declines, there was a slight recovery in the last hour, with price increases across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, suggesting a potential stabilization or short-term rebound. However, the technical indicators remain largely bearish, with most assets trading below their lower Bollinger Bands and showing no strong buy signals from moving averages.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight recovery in the last hour, Bitcoin remains under pressure from macroeconomic factors and bearish technical indicators. The recent news of trade tensions further supports a cautious stance.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum's recent price increase is overshadowed by a broader market downturn and bearish technical signals. The lack of a strong recovery signal suggests maintaining a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana has shown a significant price increase in the last hour, but overall bearish technical indicators and lack of significant news suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin has experienced a price increase, but with no significant news or bullish technical signals, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, maintaining higher exposure to USDT as a stable asset is advisable to manage risk and preserve capital."
2025-02-02 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as rising U.S. tariffs and trade tensions, which have led to a significant downturn in the crypto market. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, exacerbated by global trade-war jitters, while Ethereum has also seen a substantial drop in price. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, and SOL suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with prices hovering near or below key support levels. In contrast, USDT maintains stability, reflecting a cautious market environment where investors might be seeking refuge in stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight recovery in the last hour, Bitcoin remains under pressure from macroeconomic factors and lacks bullish technical signals. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market sentiment.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum has faced a significant price drop and continues to show weak technical indicators. While holding a position, a slight reduction is advisable to manage risk.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's price has shown some resilience with recent increases, but the overall lack of significant news and weak technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin has experienced minor fluctuations without significant news or technical changes, warranting a hold position with no clear directional preference.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and the need for stability, increasing exposure to USDT is favorable as it provides a safe haven amidst market volatility."
2025-02-02 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping below key support levels amid global trade-war jitters. Ethereum has also seen a significant decline, reflecting the broader market downturn. Technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with most assets trading below their moving averages and showing potential breakdowns in price regimes. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are showing relative strength, indicating a flight to safety as investors seek to preserve capital.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is under significant selling pressure due to macroeconomic concerns and is trading below key technical levels. The news of trade tensions further exacerbates bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is experiencing a notable decline in line with the broader market downturn. Technical indicators do not support a bullish outlook, and recent news highlights additional downward pressure.

SOL: 0.0 — Although Solana has not been directly impacted by significant news, it is following the general market trend with no clear bullish signals. Neutral stance due to lack of distinct catalysts.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows no significant news or technical signals to warrant a change in allocation. It remains stable within its current trading range.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market environment, USDT is favored as a safe haven. The stablecoin's technical indicators suggest bullish momentum, making it an attractive option for capital preservation."
2025-02-02 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have negatively impacted investor confidence. This has led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing notable declines. Technical indicators for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest continued downward pressure, as all are trading below key moving averages and showing no bullish momentum. In contrast, USDT is exhibiting bullish momentum, indicating a flight to safety as investors seek to preserve capital in stablecoins amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent price breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band, coupled with bearish news and technical indicators, suggests further downside risk. Given the small BTC holding, a cautious reduction is warranted.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is experiencing significant downward pressure with no bullish technical signals. The broader market decline and lack of positive news support a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the price decline, there is no significant news affecting Solana, and on-chain activity remains stable. Maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the current market conditions.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin has seen a price drop, but with no significant news or technical signals, maintaining the current position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.8 — With increased market volatility and bearish sentiment across other assets, USDT's stability and bullish momentum make it an attractive option for capital preservation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a significant sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping to a three-week low, while Ethereum has also experienced a notable decline. Technical indicators across most assets suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with several assets trading below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. In this environment, there is a heightened preference for stability, as reflected in the bullish momentum for USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is experiencing significant downward pressure due to macroeconomic factors and technical breakdown signals. Without current holdings, a negative score is not applicable, but caution is advised.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is facing a downturn with no bullish technical signals and negative news sentiment. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market conditions.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the overall bearish market, Solana shows normal on-chain activity and no significant news impact. Holding current positions is advisable.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news or technical changes. Maintaining current exposure is appropriate.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, USDT's stability and bullish momentum make it an attractive asset for capital preservation. Increasing exposure is recommended."
2025-02-02 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, influenced heavily by macroeconomic factors such as the escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and other countries, which have led to a sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced significant declines, with Bitcoin dropping below $95K and Ethereum down by approximately 5.6%. Technical indicators across most assets suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with many assets trading below their respective moving averages and showing breakdowns in price regimes. In this environment, capital preservation and risk management are key, suggesting a preference for stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines and negative news, Bitcoin is a major asset with potential for recovery. However, current technicals and macroeconomic pressures suggest a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum has seen a significant price drop and lacks bullish signals. Given the current holdings, reducing exposure slightly may be prudent to manage risk.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana has shown some price recovery, but without significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining the current position is advisable.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin has experienced a price increase, but without substantial news or technical support, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted to manage volatility.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for quick reallocation when market conditions improve."
2025-02-02 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have negatively impacted investor confidence. This has led to significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing notable drops. Despite some minor recoveries in the last few hours, technical indicators remain weak, with no strong buy signals for most assets. The stablecoin USDT shows bullish momentum, indicating a flight to safety as investors seek to preserve capital amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price recovery, the overall sentiment remains bearish due to macroeconomic pressures and lack of technical buy signals. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent market downturn and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate potential losses.

SOL: 0.0 — Although there was a recent price increase, the absence of significant news or strong technical signals warrants a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintaining current exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current bearish market conditions and USDT's bullish momentum, increasing exposure to this stablecoin can provide a safe haven for capital preservation."
2025-02-02 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 17.89, and a strong U.S. dollar index at 108.78, which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The market sentiment is bearish, driven by global trade tensions and recent sell-offs in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has faced significant downward pressure, dropping below key levels due to escalating trade wars and investor anxiety. Ethereum has also experienced a notable decline, reflecting broader market weakness. In contrast, Solana and Dogecoin have not been significantly impacted by news, but their technical indicators do not suggest any immediate bullish momentum. USDT remains stable, with its technicals indicating a slight preference for holding amidst uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The macroeconomic pressures and recent news of trade tensions have pushed Bitcoin lower, and without any holdings, there's no need to reduce exposure further. However, caution is warranted given the bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's recent decline and lack of bullish technical indicators suggest a cautious approach. The broader market downturn impacts its attractiveness.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a lack of significant news, Solana's price has remained relatively stable. Without clear bullish signals, maintaining the current position is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no major news and stable technical indicators, there is no compelling reason to adjust the current exposure to Dogecoin.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital and mitigate risk. Its stable nature provides a safe haven amidst volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is generally bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as trade-war jitters and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, in particular, has been affected, with its price dropping significantly below recent highs. Ethereum has also experienced a notable decline, reflecting broader market weakness. Despite the negative sentiment, Solana and Dogecoin have shown some resilience with slight price increases, although they lack strong technical buy signals. USDT remains stable with some bullish momentum, indicating a cautious market environment where investors may be seeking safety in stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines due to macroeconomic pressures, there is no strong technical or on-chain signal to suggest a significant change in allocation.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum is experiencing downward pressure, both from market sentiment and technical indicators, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana shows some positive price movement and bullish momentum, warranting a modest increase in allocation despite the lack of significant news.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's recent price activity is mixed, with no clear signals from technical indicators or news, suggesting a hold position.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and the stability of USDT, increasing exposure to this stablecoin is prudent to hedge against volatility in other assets."
2025-02-02 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as rising trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, falling below $95K, driven by global trade-war jitters. Ethereum has also seen a significant drop of approximately 5.6%, reflecting the broader market downturn. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with short-term moving averages below long-term averages and MACD signals indicating bearish trends. In contrast, USDT shows some bullish momentum, suggesting a preference for stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop and negative news, there is no strong technical buy signal, and the market remains cautious. Maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the current macroeconomic uncertainties.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant recent price decline and lack of bullish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure to ETH to mitigate risk, especially since it is currently held in the portfolio.

SOL: +0.2 — While there is no significant news, the slight increase in price and bullish momentum signal from MACD provide a modest positive outlook, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining a neutral position is appropriate, as there are no clear drivers for a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and the bullish momentum signal for USDT, increasing exposure to this stablecoin is advisable to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-02 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, as reflected in the elevated VIX, and a strong U.S. dollar index. These factors, combined with recent geopolitical tensions, have contributed to a bearish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant price declines, exacerbated by negative news related to trade tensions and broader market downturns. Despite these challenges, Solana shows some resilience with bullish momentum signals, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news impact. Tether (USDT) continues to serve as a safe haven amid market uncertainty, although its technical indicators are mixed.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent price decline and negative news sentiment, coupled with no bullish technical signals, suggest a cautious approach. However, since there is no current holding, no reduction is possible.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum's recent price drop and lack of positive momentum indicate caution. The broader market downturn impacts its attractiveness, but no reduction is possible due to current holdings.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the market downturn, Solana shows bullish momentum signals and has no negative news, suggesting potential for recovery.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT as a stable asset is prudent, although its technical indicators are mixed."
2025-02-02 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as rising U.S. tariffs and escalating trade tensions, which have negatively impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, exacerbated by global trade-war jitters, while Ethereum has also seen a notable decline. Despite the broader market downturn, Solana has shown some bullish momentum in its technical indicators, although it too has faced price decreases. Dogecoin and Tether have not been significantly impacted by news, but Dogecoin's price has decreased substantially in the last hour. The macroeconomic environment, with a high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices, suggests a cautious approach, with a potential preference for stable assets like USDT in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the bearish news and price decline, no current holdings in BTC suggest a neutral stance. The market sentiment is negative, but no immediate action is needed without existing exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant price drop and bearish market sentiment warrant a cautious reduction in exposure. The broader market downturn and lack of bullish signals suggest limited upside potential in the short term.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the recent price decrease, bullish momentum signals and no significant negative news provide a slight positive outlook. Maintaining or slightly increasing exposure could be beneficial if momentum persists.

DOGE: -0.1 — Significant price decrease without major news indicates a slight reduction in exposure. The lack of bullish signals and overall market sentiment suggest caution.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent. The potential for further market declines makes USDT an attractive safe haven."

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have contributed to a sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline, dropping below $95,000, and Ethereum has also seen a notable decrease of approximately 5.6%. The broader crypto market is experiencing downward pressure, with most assets showing negative price movements and technical indicators signaling bearish trends. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are likely to be more attractive as investors seek safety amid heightened volatility and uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent drop below $95,000, coupled with bearish macroeconomic news, suggests further downside risk. No current holdings, so no reduction.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's significant price decline and lack of bullish technical signals indicate a cautious approach. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the overall market sentiment and lack of significant news suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — With no significant news and a consistent downward trend, a slight reduction in holdings is prudent.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is advisable to manage risk and preserve capital."
2025-02-02 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as trade tensions and rising tariffs, which have led to a sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, experiencing a significant drop below $95K due to these global trade-war jitters. Ethereum has also seen a notable decline of approximately 5.6%, reflecting the broader market downturn. Despite the negative sentiment, Solana and Dogecoin have shown some resilience with recent price increases, although they still lack strong bullish signals. The stablecoin USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price recovery, the overall bearish macroeconomic context and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

ETH: 0.0 — While Ethereum has experienced a slight price increase, the broader market downturn and lack of strong bullish signals warrant a neutral position.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana shows bullish momentum and recent price increases, suggesting a moderate buy signal despite the lack of significant news.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's recent price increase and normal on-chain activity indicate a slight positive sentiment, justifying a modest buy signal.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and the need for a safe haven, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent."
2025-02-02 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as rising trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a market-wide sell-off. Bitcoin has been particularly impacted, dropping to a three-week low, while Ethereum has also seen a significant decline. Despite these pressures, Solana has shown some resilience with bullish momentum signals, and Dogecoin has experienced a slight recovery in price. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by a high U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets, with a potential preference for stablecoins like USDT in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The bearish macroeconomic news and technical indicators suggest a cautious stance on Bitcoin, despite a slight recovery in the last hour. Given the lack of holdings, no reduction is possible, but the sentiment remains negative.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is experiencing downward pressure from both market sentiment and technical indicators. With existing holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is advisable.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the broader market downturn, Solana shows bullish momentum, making it relatively more attractive than other assets. Maintain current exposure with a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators. Hold current exposure without adjustments.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish market conditions and the need for a safe haven, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to manage risk and maintain liquidity."
2025-02-02 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by macroeconomic concerns such as rising trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have negatively impacted Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has experienced significant downward pressure, dropping to a three-week low, while Ethereum has also seen a notable decline. Despite the negative sentiment, Solana shows some resilience with bullish momentum signals, and Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news or technical changes. In this environment, maintaining a cautious approach with a preference for stability and selective exposure to assets with positive signals is prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent sell-off and negative news, Bitcoin's price is stabilizing. With no current holdings, a neutral stance is appropriate as we monitor for potential recovery signals.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent market downturn and negative news have pressured Ethereum's price. Given current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted to mitigate risk.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana shows bullish momentum and positive technical indicators, suggesting potential for gains. Increasing exposure slightly aligns with a strategic rotation into assets with positive signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin remains stable with no significant changes in data or sentiment. Maintaining current exposure is appropriate until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: +0.2 — In a bearish market environment, holding a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against volatility and allows for flexibility in reallocating capital as conditions change."

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and other countries, which have led to a sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a significant decline, influenced by new U.S. tariffs and global trade-war jitters, pushing its price below $95K. Ethereum has also experienced a notable drop, reflecting the broader market downturn. Despite the bearish sentiment, Solana shows some resilience with bullish momentum signals, while Dogecoin and USDT remain relatively stable without significant news impacts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The bearish macroeconomic news and technical indicators suggest a cautious approach. Despite not holding BTC, the overall market sentiment is negative, and BTC is not attractive for new allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum has been affected by the market downturn, but it is already held in the portfolio. The technical indicators are mixed, and the recent price drop suggests holding rather than increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the market downturn, Solana shows bullish momentum signals and has not been significantly impacted by negative news. It remains relatively attractive for allocation.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin has experienced a significant price decrease and is currently below its lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Given the current holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

USDT: +0.1 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for stability, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-02 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns, including escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a significant sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, dropping below $95,000, and Ethereum has also seen a substantial decrease of approximately 5.6%. The technical indicators for most cryptocurrencies show bearish trends, with prices falling below key support levels and momentum signals indicating further downside potential. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are likely to be favored as a safe haven due to increased market volatility and risk aversion.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price decline and negative news, Bitcoin's lack of current holdings suggests a neutral stance. The macroeconomic environment suggests caution, but no immediate action is needed without existing exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's significant price drop and bearish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure. The broader market downturn and lack of positive momentum warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana has experienced a significant price decrease with bearish momentum signals. Although there is no significant news, the technical outlook suggests a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.4 — Dogecoin's price has significantly decreased, and technical indicators are bearish. With no positive news to offset the decline, reducing exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable as it provides stability and liquidity amid heightened volatility and risk aversion."
2025-02-02 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping to a three-week low, while Ethereum has also seen a substantial decline. The technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with prices breaking below key support levels as indicated by Bollinger Bands. In this environment, the market is experiencing heightened volatility, and there is a noticeable flight to safety, which is reflected in the increased demand for stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop and negative news, BTC's current lack of holdings in the portfolio suggests a neutral stance, as further downside risk is balanced by potential long-term recovery opportunities.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's significant price decline and bearish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure to mitigate further losses, especially given the current market downturn.

SOL: -0.2 — With SOL experiencing a significant price drop and bearish technical signals, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted to protect against further downside risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — The pronounced price decline and bearish momentum indicators for DOGE justify a reduction in holdings to limit potential losses amid the current market conditions.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of the bearish market sentiment and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-02 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as rising U.S. tariffs and global trade tensions, which have led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin dropping below $95K and Ethereum down approximately 5.6%. Despite a slight recovery in the last hour, technical indicators for most assets remain weak, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals indicating bearish momentum. In this environment, the stability of USDT becomes more attractive as investors seek refuge from volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a slight recovery in the last hour, Bitcoin remains under pressure from macroeconomic factors and lacks bullish technical signals. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum has faced significant downward pressure, and technical indicators remain bearish. Given current holdings, a cautious reduction is warranted.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana shows mixed signals with a recent price increase but lacks strong bullish momentum. Holding the current position seems prudent.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin has experienced a significant drop and remains below key technical levels. A slight reduction in holdings is advised.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining or increasing exposure to USDT is sensible to preserve capital and reduce risk exposure."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a significant sell-off in the crypto market. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin dropping below $95,000 and Ethereum down approximately 5.6%. This bearish sentiment is reflected in the technical indicators, with most assets trading below their moving averages and momentum signals indicating no bullish trends. The volatility index remains relatively low, suggesting that while there is a downturn, it is not accompanied by extreme market panic. In this environment, the focus should be on preserving capital and maintaining liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The ongoing trade-war concerns and significant price drop suggest a cautious approach. Without current holdings, a negative score is not applicable, but a neutral to slightly negative stance is warranted given the macroeconomic pressures.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum's significant price decrease and lack of bullish technical signals indicate a cautious stance. Current holdings should be maintained with a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana's price movements mirror the broader market downturn. Neutral stance as there are no clear signals to increase or decrease exposure significantly.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical indicators suggesting a change, maintain current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for liquidity, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide flexibility for future opportunities."
2025-02-02 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns, particularly the escalation of trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs. This has led to a sell-off across the crypto market, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant drop below $95K, reflecting broader investor anxiety. Ethereum has also been affected, with a notable decline of approximately 5.6%. Despite the absence of significant news for Solana, Dogecoin, and Tether, the overall market environment remains cautious, with technical indicators showing no clear buy signals and momentum indicators remaining bearish.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop and negative news, Bitcoin's historical resilience and lack of current holdings suggest a neutral stance to avoid unnecessary volatility exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued sell pressure and significant recent price decrease warrant a cautious approach, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure to manage risk.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable on-chain activity, maintaining the current position is prudent given the overall market uncertainty.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price declines and lack of positive catalysts suggest a slight reduction in exposure to mitigate potential downside risk.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer, aligning with risk-averse strategies."
2025-02-02 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is marked by heightened volatility and uncertainty, primarily driven by escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs. This has led to a general risk-off sentiment, with significant sell-offs observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, influenced by broader market anxieties and specific news events. Despite these challenges, the market data indicates some recovery attempts, although technical indicators remain largely bearish. In such an environment, stablecoins like USDT may see increased demand as investors seek safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price increases, the overall sentiment remains negative due to trade-war jitters and technical indicators showing no bullish signals. Given the lack of BTC holdings, a cautious stance is warranted.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's recent significant price drop and bearish technical indicators suggest further downside risk. Current holdings should be reduced slightly to mitigate potential losses.

SOL: +0.1 — Solana shows resilience with a slight price increase and stable on-chain activity, but lacks strong bullish signals. Maintain current exposure with a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's price fluctuations are not supported by significant news or technical signals. Maintain current holdings without changes.

USDT: +0.6 — In a risk-off environment, USDT remains attractive as a safe haven. Increased demand for stability justifies a higher allocation to protect against market volatility."
2025-02-02 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic concerns such as rising U.S. tariffs and trade tensions, which have led to a sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline, dropping below $95,000, and Ethereum has also seen a notable decrease of approximately 5.6%. Technical indicators across most assets show a lack of bullish signals, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals below their lines. In this environment, USDT, as a stablecoin, has shown some bullish momentum, indicating a potential flight to safety as investors seek to reduce exposure to volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines and negative news, there is no strong technical signal to suggest further downside. Maintaining a neutral stance as the market digests macroeconomic developments.

ETH: -0.4 — Recent significant price drop and bearish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure. The broader market downturn and lack of positive catalysts weigh on sentiment.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to drive a change in allocation. Maintaining a neutral position as the asset shows stability within its price range.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, there are no strong technical or news-driven catalysts to justify a change in allocation. Holding current position.

USDT: +0.5 — With the bearish market sentiment and increased volatility, a higher allocation to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been particularly affected, with significant price declines and heightened volatility. The market is experiencing a flight to safety, with traders reducing exposure to riskier assets like Solana and Dogecoin. The stability of USDT remains appealing in this environment, as it provides a safe haven amid the broader market turmoil.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent sell-off and macroeconomic pressures, Bitcoin remains a key asset with potential for recovery. However, current technical indicators do not provide a clear buy signal.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum is experiencing significant downward pressure and technical weakness, exacerbated by high liquidation volumes. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current downtrend.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana is facing a sell-off alongside other major tokens, with no immediate signs of recovery. Reducing exposure is advisable to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — Dogecoin has been hit hard by the market downturn, with significant price declines. Reducing exposure is recommended to limit downside risk.

USDT: +0.7 — In the current bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-03 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic events, notably the U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across crypto assets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price declines, with Ethereum and Dogecoin particularly affected by large liquidations and a broader market capitulation. The volatility index is relatively high, indicating increased market uncertainty. In contrast, Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status, suggesting a flight to safety as investors seek to preserve capital amidst the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a significant price drop and bearish macroeconomic news, BTC's lack of current holdings in the portfolio suggests a neutral stance, awaiting clearer signals for re-entry.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's sharp decline and vulnerability to macro sell-offs, coupled with existing holdings, warrant a reduction in exposure to mitigate further losses.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's participation in the broader market rout and existing portfolio holdings suggest a cautious reduction in exposure, though not as severe as Ethereum's situation.

DOGE: -0.4 — With significant price drops and existing holdings, reducing exposure to Dogecoin is prudent given its high volatility and susceptibility to macroeconomic pressures.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish environment, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital and maintain liquidity, as it remains stable amidst market turbulence."
2025-02-03 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns, particularly the new U.S. tariffs that have triggered a global sell-off. This has led to significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin all experiencing substantial drops. Ethereum and Solana have been particularly hard hit, with Ethereum leading in liquidations and Solana suffering from a sharp decline in Asian markets. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea indicates localized bearish sentiment for Bitcoin. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable and has shown bullish momentum, suggesting a flight to safety as investors seek refuge in stablecoins amidst the volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent sell-off, Bitcoin's slight rebound and the lack of current holdings suggest a neutral stance. The macroeconomic sensitivity and local bearish sentiment in Korea warrant caution.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's significant recent decline and vulnerability during macro sell-offs indicate a need to reduce exposure, especially given the current holdings.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline and its inclusion in the broader market rout suggest reducing exposure, though the existing holdings should be managed cautiously to avoid overreacting to short-term volatility.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's drop alongside other major tokens and the broader market crash in Asia suggest a slight reduction in exposure, given the current holdings.

USDT: +0.8 — With the market in a bearish phase and USDT showing bullish momentum, increasing exposure to this stablecoin is prudent to preserve capital and mitigate risk."
2025-02-03 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and bearish sentiment, largely driven by macroeconomic factors such as new U.S. tariffs that have triggered a global sell-off. This has resulted in significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin experiencing sharp drops. The market's sensitivity to macroeconomic events is evident, as seen in the substantial liquidations and price volatility. Despite some slight recoveries in the last hour, the overall trend remains cautious, with market participants showing a preference for risk-off assets like USDT amid the uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines and macroeconomic pressures, Bitcoin's slight recovery and on-chain activity suggest a hold position, as the market seeks stability.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from significant liquidations and a pronounced downtrend, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure given its vulnerability to macro sell-offs.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana has experienced sharp declines amid broader market fears, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure to manage risk, despite recent price recovery attempts.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's recent price volatility and inclusion in the broader market crash suggest a minor reduction in exposure, balancing potential recovery with ongoing risks.

USDT: +0.6 — With increased market volatility and risk aversion, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven, allowing for flexibility in re-entering riskier assets once conditions stabilize."
2025-02-03 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and bearish sentiment, largely driven by macroeconomic events such as the U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a significant sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced substantial price declines, exacerbated by technical downtrends and liquidation events. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and the tariff-induced market rout highlight the sensitivity of crypto assets to global economic developments. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status, serving as a safe haven amidst the market turmoil.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent sell-off and bearish sentiment, Bitcoin's price has shown some resilience with slight rebounds, but overall market conditions remain uncertain.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum has been at the forefront of liquidations and technical downtrends, indicating continued vulnerability in the current macroeconomic climate.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana has experienced significant declines amid the broader market sell-off, with no immediate signs of recovery, warranting a cautious stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's performance mirrors the broader market decline, but without significant individual news or technical signals to justify a strong directional move.

USDT: +0.5 — In the face of market volatility and risk aversion, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven largely by macroeconomic events such as the U.S. tariff announcement, which has triggered a global sell-off. This has led to significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. The volatility index (VIX) is moderately elevated, indicating increased market uncertainty. Despite some price rebounds, technical indicators for most assets remain weak, with short-term moving averages below long-term averages and MACD signals below their lines. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong, which typically pressures risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. In this environment, USDT's stability and bullish technical signals make it an attractive safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a recent price rebound, BTC remains sensitive to macroeconomic events with no strong buy signals from technical indicators. The ""kimchi premium"" suggests regional bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.2 — ETH has been leading in liquidations and is in a pronounced downtrend, reflecting vulnerability to macro sell-offs. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

SOL: -0.3 — SOL has experienced significant volatility and is part of the broader market rout. The lack of positive technical signals suggests reducing exposure is prudent.

DOGE: -0.1 — DOGE has been heavily impacted by the tariff-driven sell-off, and while there was a recent price increase, the overall sentiment remains weak. A slight reduction in holdings is advisable.

USDT: +0.6 — With the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, supported by its bullish technical signals."
2025-02-03 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as new U.S. tariffs that have triggered a global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price declines, reflecting heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic events and increased volatility. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and massive liquidations in Ethereum further underscore the market's vulnerability. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status, suggesting a potential flight to safety as investors seek to preserve capital amid uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility and macroeconomic sensitivity, Bitcoin's on-chain activity shows some resilience. However, without a clear bullish signal, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum has been heavily impacted by recent liquidations and a significant downtrend. Given the current bearish sentiment and technical weakness, reducing exposure is advisable.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana has been part of the broader market rout, with significant price drops. Although there is some bullish momentum in the last hour, the overall sentiment remains negative, warranting a cautious reduction.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin has also suffered from the market sell-off, with significant declines. While recent price increases suggest some recovery, the broader bearish environment justifies a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current risk-averse market, Tether's stability makes it an attractive asset for capital preservation. Increasing exposure to USDT can help mitigate portfolio risk during this volatile period."
2025-02-03 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as the U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced substantial declines, with Ethereum and Solana particularly hard hit due to their high volatility and sensitivity to broader market conditions. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and a global market rout highlight the heightened sensitivity of these assets to macroeconomic events. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during periods of high market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent volatility and macroeconomic pressures, Bitcoin's price has shown some resilience with a recent rebound. However, the lack of strong technical signals suggests a neutral stance.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum has been at the forefront of liquidations and a significant downtrend, indicating a need to reduce exposure due to its heightened vulnerability in the current market environment.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana has experienced a sharp decline amid the broader market sell-off, and while there is some bullish momentum, the overall sentiment remains negative, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin has faced similar sell-off pressures, but recent bullish momentum suggests a hold position as the market stabilizes.

USDT: +0.8 — Given the current bearish market conditions and the need for a safe haven, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk effectively."
2025-02-03 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This has led to significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. The heightened volatility and sell-off have been exacerbated by technical downtrends and liquidation events, particularly affecting Ethereum. Despite these conditions, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market uncertainty. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility, further underscore the risk-off environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price fluctuations and bearish news, BTC's on-chain activity remains low, and there is no clear technical buy signal. Maintaining a neutral stance as the market digests macroeconomic impacts.

ETH: -0.5 — Significant recent price decline and high liquidation levels signal vulnerability. Reducing exposure due to ongoing technical downtrend and macroeconomic pressures.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent price drops and bearish news in the Asian markets suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly to manage risk amid broader market sell-off.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite recent price increases, DOGE remains affected by the broader market downturn and tariff-related news. Slightly reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

USDT: +0.8 — In a risk-off environment, USDT's stability and bullish technical indicators make it an attractive asset for capital preservation. Increasing allocation to maintain liquidity and reduce portfolio volatility."
2025-02-03 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, largely driven by macroeconomic concerns such as new U.S. tariffs, which have triggered a significant global sell-off. This has led to substantial price declines across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, with each experiencing notable drops in value. The heightened volatility and market sensitivity to macro events underscore the current risk-averse environment. In contrast, USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during periods of market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price drops and bearish news, BTC's on-chain activity remains stable, suggesting a hold position as it may stabilize in the near term.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's significant price drop and vulnerability to macroeconomic events suggest reducing exposure, especially given its recent technical downtrend.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's price decline amid broader market sell-offs and tariff fears indicates a cautious approach, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Although DOGE has shown some positive momentum, the overall bearish market sentiment and recent price volatility suggest a conservative stance.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of the current risk-averse market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant declines, reflecting heightened sensitivity to geopolitical events and macroeconomic instability. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and large-scale liquidations in Ethereum further underscore the market's vulnerability. Despite these challenges, there are signs of short-term rebounds, but the broader trend remains cautious. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are likely to see increased demand as investors seek safety amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price rebounds, the overall bearish macroeconomic environment and lack of strong buy signals suggest a neutral stance for Bitcoin.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's vulnerability to macro sell-offs and recent technical downtrends warrant a cautious approach, maintaining a neutral position.

SOL: -0.3 — Holding a position in Solana, but given its significant drop amid tariff fears and broader market sell-off, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

DOGE: -0.2 — Similar to Solana, Dogecoin has been affected by the market downturn, suggesting a modest reduction in holdings to mitigate risk.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, increasing exposure to USDT as a safe haven is advisable to preserve capital."
2025-02-03 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off. This has led to significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum and Solana experiencing notable drops. Bitcoin has shown some resilience but remains sensitive to macroeconomic events. The volatility index is moderately high, indicating increased market uncertainty. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are seeing increased demand as investors seek refuge from market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic context and recent news suggest caution. BTC is sensitive to macro events, and without current holdings, a neutral stance is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is experiencing a technical downtrend and has been heavily impacted by recent liquidations. Without current holdings, maintaining a neutral position is advisable.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant declines amid market sell-offs and tariff fears suggest reducing exposure. Current holdings should be cautiously managed given the bearish sentiment.

DOGE: -0.2 — Similar to SOL, DOGE has been affected by the broader market crash. Reducing exposure slightly is recommended given the current portfolio position.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and mitigate risk. The stablecoin's stability is attractive amid heightened volatility."
2025-02-03 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures, particularly the recent U.S. tariff announcements that have triggered a global sell-off. This has led to significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, which have all experienced substantial drops. The heightened volatility and market sensitivity to macro events are evident, with Ethereum and Solana showing pronounced vulnerability. In contrast, Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during periods of market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic environment and recent news indicate heightened risk, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's recent significant price drop and vulnerability to macro sell-offs suggest maintaining a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.3 — Current holdings should be reduced slightly due to Solana's pronounced decline amid tariff fears and broader market weakness.

DOGE: -0.2 — Given the recent sell-off and lack of strong recovery signals, a slight reduction in Dogecoin holdings is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the current bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-02-03 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, largely driven by macroeconomic factors such as the U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price declines, reflecting heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic events and a broader market capitulation. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and the substantial liquidations in Ethereum highlight regional and asset-specific vulnerabilities. Despite the bearish sentiment, there is some bullish momentum in technical indicators, but the overarching macroeconomic pressures are likely to dominate short-term market movements. In such an environment, maintaining liquidity through stablecoins like USDT could be prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic environment and recent news suggest caution. The lack of current holdings also means no immediate need to reduce exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing significant liquidation pressures and a technical downtrend, but without current holdings, a neutral stance is appropriate until conditions stabilize.

SOL: -0.3 — Given the current holdings and recent sharp declines due to macroeconomic pressures, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.3 — Similar to Solana, Dogecoin has been heavily impacted by the tariff-driven sell-off. Reducing exposure slightly aligns with risk management in a bearish market.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for liquidity, maintaining or slightly increasing USDT holdings provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have led to a significant sell-off across the crypto market. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced notable declines, with Ethereum and Solana particularly affected by liquidations and technical downtrends. Despite a recent rebound, the market remains sensitive to macroeconomic developments, and volatility is high. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during periods of market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility and macroeconomic pressures, Bitcoin's rebound and bullish momentum signal suggest potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to the overall bearish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's vulnerability during macro sell-offs and recent technical downtrend make it a less attractive option at the moment, despite some bullish momentum.

SOL: -0.2 — Given the current holdings and Solana's sharp drop amid tariff fears, reducing exposure slightly is prudent, although recent price increases suggest some recovery potential.

DOGE: -0.1 — While Dogecoin has rebounded, the broader market crash and lack of strong positive signals suggest a cautious approach, with a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and high volatility, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-03 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a recent rebound in cryptocurrency prices following a significant sell-off triggered by new U.S. tariffs. This sell-off led to a substantial dip in major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, which have since shown signs of recovery. The macroeconomic context remains challenging, with elevated volatility and a strong U.S. dollar index, which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets. Despite the recent price uptick, the broader sentiment remains cautious, with traders wary of further macroeconomic shocks. Stablecoin USDT remains a safe haven amid these uncertainties, as evidenced by its stable price and positive technical indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin has shown strong upward momentum in the last hour, breaking above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a potential breakout. However, macroeconomic risks and recent news suggest caution.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, Ethereum's technical indicators do not signal a strong buy, and recent news highlights its vulnerability to macroeconomic sell-offs.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana has experienced a significant price increase and a buy signal in its trend indicators, suggesting potential for further gains, though recent news of volatility warrants a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin has rebounded strongly, but given its recent volatility and lack of significant news, a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — As the market shows signs of recovery, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with potential for higher returns."
2025-02-03 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have led to a significant global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been particularly sensitive to these macroeconomic events, experiencing sharp declines. Despite this, there has been a recent rebound in prices, suggesting some resilience. However, the news indicates a broader market capitulation, with significant liquidations and price drops across major cryptocurrencies, including Solana and Dogecoin. The macroeconomic context, with a high U.S. dollar index and stable gold prices, suggests a risk-off environment, favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent sell-off, BTC shows signs of recovery with bullish momentum and a buy signal from the moving averages. However, macroeconomic pressures remain a concern.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing significant sell pressure and technical downtrends, making it less attractive despite some bullish momentum signals.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana has been heavily impacted by the recent market rout and tariff fears, with no clear recovery signals yet. Reducing exposure slightly due to current holdings.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin has also been affected by the market downturn, and while it shows some bullish momentum, the broader market sentiment remains negative. Slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In a risk-off environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital amid ongoing market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty."
2025-02-03 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic developments, particularly the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a significant sell-off across the crypto market. This has resulted in sharp declines for major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, although there are signs of a slight rebound in the last hour. Despite the recent downturn, technical indicators for BTC, SOL, and DOGE show bullish momentum, suggesting potential for recovery. However, the broader macroeconomic context remains uncertain, with elevated volatility and a strong U.S. dollar index, which could continue to pressure risk assets. In this environment, maintaining a balanced approach with some exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, BTC shows bullish momentum and a potential breakout, supported by increased on-chain activity. However, macroeconomic risks remain a concern.

ETH: 0.0 — ETH is experiencing a technical downtrend and significant liquidation pressures, making it less attractive despite bullish momentum indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — SOL has shown bullish momentum and buy signals, but recent news of significant declines amid tariff fears warrants caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE has bullish momentum but is also affected by the broader market sell-off, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2025-02-03 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market is experiencing a recovery from a recent sell-off triggered by U.S. tariff announcements, which caused significant volatility and price declines across major cryptocurrencies. Despite the recent rebound in prices, the market remains sensitive to macroeconomic developments, as evidenced by the ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and the liquidation events in Ethereum. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have shown signs of recovery with bullish momentum and buy signals in technical indicators. However, the recent news highlights the market's vulnerability to external economic shocks, suggesting cautious optimism is warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and buy signals, but recent macroeconomic sensitivity and the ""kimchi premium"" suggest a moderate allocation increase is prudent.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent liquidations and a technical downtrend, Ethereum's bullish momentum and recovery in price warrant a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana has shown significant price recovery and bullish technical indicators, but recent news of a sharp drop suggests a moderate allocation increase.

DOGE: +0.1 — Dogecoin's recent price increase and bullish momentum are positive, but the asset's high volatility and recent market crash call for a conservative approach.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows signs of recovery, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of riskier assets with positive momentum is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment is currently characterized by heightened volatility due to new U.S. tariffs, which have triggered a global sell-off across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies experienced significant price fluctuations, with Bitcoin showing a potential breakout despite recent bearish news. Ethereum and Solana have been particularly affected by the sell-off, with Ethereum leading in liquidations and Solana experiencing sharp declines in Asian markets. Dogecoin also saw a notable drop but has shown signs of recovery. Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market turbulence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the recent sell-off linked to macroeconomic events, Bitcoin's technical indicators show strong bullish momentum and a potential breakout, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's recent vulnerability to macro sell-offs and significant liquidations suggest caution. Although there is bullish momentum, the broader technical downtrend warrants a conservative approach.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana has shown resilience with a recent price increase and bullish technical indicators, but the recent market rout and news of sharp declines suggest a moderate allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's recent price surge and bullish signals are offset by its inclusion in the broader market crash, resulting in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current market volatility and potential for further price increases in other cryptocurrencies, there is a strategic opportunity to rotate some capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains."
2025-02-03 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic events, particularly the recent U.S. tariff announcements which have triggered a global sell-off. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price fluctuations, with notable sell-offs in response to these macroeconomic pressures. Despite the recent price rebounds, the overall sentiment remains cautious, with investors wary of further macroeconomic developments. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and the significant liquidations in Ethereum highlight regional and asset-specific vulnerabilities. In this context, maintaining a balanced portfolio with a focus on risk management is crucial.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin shows strong on-chain activity and bullish technical indicators, suggesting potential for recovery. However, macroeconomic sensitivity warrants caution.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's significant recent downturn and vulnerability to liquidations suggest a cautious approach, despite some technical buy signals.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's recent price recovery and bullish technical indicators are promising, but the asset remains sensitive to macroeconomic pressures.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin has experienced volatility, its technical indicators remain bullish. However, the lack of significant news or developments suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current volatile market, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against further macroeconomic shocks and allows for flexibility in reallocating capital as conditions stabilize."
2025-02-03 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently mixed with a slight bullish tilt, despite recent macroeconomic pressures. The announcement of new U.S. tariffs has triggered a global sell-off, impacting cryptocurrencies significantly. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience with recent rebounds, although they remain sensitive to macroeconomic events. Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced volatility, particularly in Asian markets, where they faced substantial sell-offs. Despite these fluctuations, technical indicators across most assets suggest bullish momentum, with short-term moving averages above long-term ones. The stablecoin USDT remains relatively unaffected by these market dynamics, serving as a safe haven during periods of heightened volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators with bullish momentum and a recent rebound from macro-driven lows. However, sensitivity to macroeconomic events warrants cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility and a significant downtrend, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive. The asset's potential for recovery justifies a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana has experienced significant volatility, but technical indicators suggest potential for upward movement. The recent price increases support a cautious buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin has shown mixed signals with recent volatility. While technical indicators are positive, the lack of significant news or developments suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall bullish technical indicators across other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of USDT and into riskier assets."
2025-02-03 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic events, particularly due to recent U.S. tariff announcements. This has led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin experiencing notable declines. Despite this, there are signs of recovery in the short-term technical indicators, with buy signals and bullish momentum observed across most assets. However, the broader macroeconomic context, including high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent sell-offs tied to macroeconomic events, Bitcoin shows strong technical indicators with buy signals and bullish momentum. The ""kimchi premium"" suggests localized bearish sentiment, but overall, BTC remains attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum has faced significant liquidation pressures, but technical indicators remain positive with bullish momentum. The recent price rebound and on-chain activity support a moderate positive stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana has been affected by the broader market rout, but technical signals remain positive. The recent price recovery and normal on-chain activity justify a cautious but positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Dogecoin has experienced volatility similar to other major assets, but technical indicators suggest potential for recovery. A slight positive allocation is warranted given the overall market conditions.

USDT: 0.0 — With the current market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainties, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent. It serves as a stable asset in the portfolio, providing liquidity and risk management."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by macroeconomic concerns such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price declines, reflecting heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic events and a broader market capitulation. Despite temporary rebounds, the overall trend remains negative, with Ethereum and Solana showing particularly pronounced downtrends. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility. The macroeconomic context, including a high U.S. dollar index and increased volatility, further supports a cautious approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the macroeconomic-driven sell-off and heightened sensitivity to global events suggest caution. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market conditions.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's significant recent price drop and vulnerability during macro sell-offs warrant a reduction in exposure. The technical downtrend and high liquidation levels add to the negative sentiment.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline amid global market fears and its inclusion in the broader Asian market crash suggest reducing exposure. The technical indicators remain positive, but macro risks overshadow them.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's substantial drop in response to tariff fears and its inclusion in the broader market crash indicate a cautious stance. While technicals are positive, macroeconomic risks are a concern.

USDT: +0.4 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is advisable. It provides stability and liquidity amid increased volatility and risk aversion."
2025-02-04 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with most cryptocurrencies showing strong technical indicators and positive momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing a recovery after a dip due to regulatory concerns, while Ethereum sees significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation. Solana has shown resilience with institutional interest and a price rebound, suggesting strong buying interest. Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions, but its price remains relatively volatile. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with ongoing discussions about its reserve transparency potentially impacting sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with strong technical indicators, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Significant outflows from exchanges and high ETF volumes indicate strong accumulation and potential for upward movement, warranting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Institutional interest and a strong price rebound above key support levels suggest a favorable environment for further gains, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Strategic acquisitions and government interest provide some positive sentiment, but price volatility suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, reducing stablecoin exposure to allocate more towards riskier assets is advisable."
2025-02-04 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with signs of recovery following recent regulatory and trade-war concerns. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding from a dip below $97K to approach $100K, driven by easing trade-war fears. Ethereum has experienced significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation despite recent price weakness. Solana is gaining institutional interest, evidenced by a major acquisition by Sol Strategies, which supports its recent price recovery. Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions and governmental interest, although its market activity remains relatively low. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, but stablecoin legislation could provide a clearer framework moving forward.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, BTC shows strong technical signals and positive recovery momentum, supported by easing trade-war fears.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation and potential for upward movement, despite recent price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and recent price recovery indicate strong support, making SOL an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there are strategic acquisitions and governmental interest, low on-chain activity and mixed news sentiment suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins to capture potential gains in other assets."
2025-02-04 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with signs of recovery in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and SOL after recent dips due to regulatory and trade-war concerns. Bitcoin is showing resilience, rebounding towards the $100K mark as trade-war fears ease, while Ethereum sees significant outflows from exchanges, suggesting potential accumulation or strategic repositioning by investors. Solana is gaining attention with strategic acquisitions by investment firms, indicating confidence in its long-term potential. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, with minor strategic acquisitions by investment firms. Meanwhile, Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency, but stablecoin regulation discussions could impact its future market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news support, particularly as trade-war concerns ease. The rebound towards $100K suggests potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price weakness, significant outflows from exchanges indicate potential accumulation, and high ETF volumes suggest strong market interest.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's price recovery and strategic acquisitions by investment firms highlight its growing appeal, with technical indicators supporting a bullish outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some strategic interest, the overall market activity and sentiment around Dogecoin remain relatively unchanged, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there is a potential shift away from stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2025-02-04 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a mix of bullish technical signals and some regulatory concerns. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards $100K after initial regulatory-induced dips, suggesting a potential recovery phase. Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation, despite recent price volatility. Solana has seen strategic accumulation by institutional players, highlighting confidence in its long-term prospects. Dogecoin has garnered attention with strategic acquisitions, though its price remains relatively stable. Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency, but the introduction of a stablecoin bill could provide regulatory clarity, impacting its future stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite regulatory concerns, Bitcoin's price rebound and bullish technical indicators suggest a moderate buy signal. The easing of trade-war fears further supports this view.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges and strong ETF volumes indicate potential accumulation, warranting a cautious buy signal despite recent price volatility.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional accumulation and price recovery above key support levels suggest strong buying interest, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some strategic interest, the overall market data and sentiment remain stable, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing exposure to USDT seems prudent, especially given ongoing regulatory scrutiny."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with signs of recovery across major cryptocurrencies, despite recent regulatory and geopolitical concerns. Bitcoin is showing resilience, rebounding towards $100K after a dip due to regulatory discussions, while Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential bullish sentiment as investors move ETH to private wallets. Solana is gaining attention with substantial institutional interest, which has helped it recover from recent lows. Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions, suggesting some investor confidence, but remains volatile. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, though regulatory scrutiny continues to loom over its operations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recovery towards $100K and bullish technical indicators suggest a positive outlook, though regulatory concerns warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges and high ETF volumes indicate strong investor interest, despite recent price volatility.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional accumulation and a strong price rebound from support levels highlight Solana's growing appeal and potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite strategic acquisitions, Dogecoin's price remains volatile with no clear directional momentum, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — As market conditions improve, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2025-02-04 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with signs of recovery in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and SOL after recent dips. Bitcoin is showing resilience, nearing the $100K mark again after a brief dip below $97K due to regulatory concerns. Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation despite recent price weakness. Solana has seen institutional interest with significant purchases, suggesting confidence in its long-term prospects. Dogecoin's recent acquisition by Neptune Digital Assets and government-related news are noteworthy, though its price has seen a sharp decline. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with ongoing discussions about regulatory transparency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, BTC is showing signs of recovery and resilience, with positive momentum indicators and nearing a key psychological level of $100K.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and despite recent price weakness, the potential for a rebound is supported by strong ETF volumes.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a recent price rebound above $200 indicate strong buying interest, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent acquisitions and government-related news, but significant price decline suggests caution until clearer trends emerge.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of recovery and risk appetite increasing, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-02-04 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a recent rebound in prices across several major cryptocurrencies following a period of volatility driven by macroeconomic concerns, such as trade-war fears. Bitcoin has shown resilience, nearing the $100K mark after a dip, supported by easing trade-war concerns. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation, while Solana has experienced a rebound, supported by institutional interest. Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions, suggesting some investor confidence, though its price remains volatile. Tether remains stable, but regulatory scrutiny continues to loom over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, BTC is showing signs of recovery with strong technical indicators and easing trade-war fears, making it relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.6 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and strong ETF volumes indicate growing institutional interest, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional accumulation and a price rebound above key support levels suggest a favorable environment for SOL, though resistance remains.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is strategic interest, the overall sentiment and technical indicators remain mixed, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With a slight increase in risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, maintaining a lower allocation in USDT is advisable."
2025-02-04 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, Bitcoin shows signs of recovery and bullish momentum, supported by easing trade-war fears. The overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and strong ETF volumes indicate active market interest, supporting a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a rebound above key support levels indicate strong buying interest, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite strategic acquisitions, Dogecoin's price remains volatile with no clear directional momentum, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2025-02-04 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with recent volatility driven by macroeconomic factors such as trade-war concerns and regulatory developments. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards $100K after initial dips due to regulatory news. Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, possibly indicating investor accumulation despite recent price weakness. Solana has seen institutional interest, with notable purchases boosting confidence in its recovery. Dogecoin's sentiment is buoyed by strategic acquisitions and government interest, though its price remains volatile. Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency, but stablecoin regulation could stabilize its role in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's recovery towards $100K and positive news sentiment suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook. The buy signal from trend indicators supports a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate potential accumulation, and strong ETF volumes suggest underlying demand. However, mixed technical signals warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a rebound above key support levels highlight Solana's relative strength. Positive sentiment and buy signals from trend indicators justify a higher allocation preference.

DOGE: +0.2 — Strategic acquisitions and government interest provide a supportive backdrop, but technical indicators remain mixed. A slight increase in allocation is warranted due to positive sentiment.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally improving risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to reallocate capital towards more promising opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable recoveries in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and SOL following recent dips. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark again, driven by easing trade-war fears, despite regulatory concerns. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or strategic repositioning by investors, while also experiencing high ETF trading volumes. Solana has shown resilience, rebounding above $200, supported by institutional interest. Dogecoin's market activity is bolstered by strategic acquisitions and government-backed initiatives, though its price remains volatile. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, but the introduction of a new stablecoin bill suggests potential long-term stability within the regulatory framework.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with easing trade-war fears and nearing a key psychological level of $100K. However, regulatory concerns temper the bullish sentiment slightly.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price weakness, significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and high ETF volumes indicate strong interest, warranting a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a strong price rebound above $200 suggest a bullish sentiment, supported by recent strategic acquisitions.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive developments with strategic acquisitions and government initiatives provide a supportive backdrop, though price volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the cautiously optimistic market sentiment and potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is warranted."
2025-02-04 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with signs of recovery in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, as trade-war fears ease and regulatory concerns are addressed. Bitcoin is showing resilience, rebounding towards the $100K mark after a dip due to regulatory news. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, which could indicate a bullish sentiment as investors move ETH to private wallets. Solana has demonstrated strong buying interest, recovering from recent lows, while Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions, suggesting confidence in its potential. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with moderate volatility, supporting a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery and nearing $100K, indicating potential for upside. The easing of trade-war fears further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — The significant outflow of ETH from exchanges suggests strong investor confidence, potentially leading to price appreciation. High ETF volumes also indicate increased interest.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's recovery above $200 and strategic acquisitions by investment firms highlight growing interest, though resistance remains around $210–220.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent strategic purchases and government-backed initiatives indicate a supportive environment for Dogecoin, although price momentum is less pronounced compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased confidence in risk assets and potential capital rotation, holding a slightly reduced position in USDT may be prudent to capitalize on growth opportunities in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-02-04 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a recent recovery in prices across major cryptocurrencies following easing trade-war fears. Bitcoin's price is nearing the $100,000 mark after a brief dip due to regulatory concerns, signaling a potential bullish sentiment. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating a possible accumulation phase, while its ETF volumes suggest heightened trading activity. Solana has shown resilience, rebounding strongly from recent lows, supported by strategic acquisitions from investment firms. Dogecoin has experienced positive news with strategic purchases and government-backed initiatives, although its price remains relatively stable. Tether's involvement in regulatory discussions highlights ongoing scrutiny of stablecoins, but it remains a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with easing trade-war concerns and nearing a key psychological level of $100,000. However, regulatory uncertainties still loom, warranting a cautious but positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and high ETF volumes indicate strong market interest. Despite recent price weakness, these factors point to potential upside.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's price recovery and strategic acquisitions by investment firms highlight growing confidence in the asset. The recent rebound above $200 suggests a positive trend.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive news regarding strategic purchases and government initiatives supports a slight bullish sentiment, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — As market sentiment turns cautiously optimistic, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with potential upside."
2025-02-04 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin is recovering from regulatory concerns and trade-war fears, nearing the $100K mark, which suggests easing of previous anxieties. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or strategic repositioning by investors, alongside record ETF volumes. Solana has experienced a notable rebound, supported by institutional interest, while Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions, hinting at increased interest despite its recent price fluctuations. Tether remains stable, though regulatory scrutiny persists, which could impact its perceived safety as a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with easing trade-war fears and nearing a psychological resistance level of $100K. Despite regulatory concerns, the overall sentiment is improving, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

**ETH: +0.6** — Significant outflows from exchanges and record ETF volumes indicate strong investor interest and potential for upward movement. The recent bullish momentum in technical indicators supports a positive allocation.

**SOL: +0.4** — Institutional accumulation and a price rebound above key support levels suggest positive sentiment. However, resistance near $210–220 warrants a cautious approach.

**DOGE: +0.2** — Strategic acquisitions and government interest provide a slight bullish sentiment, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests only a modest increase in allocation.

**USDT: -0.3** — With improving market sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a slight recovery in prices across major cryptocurrencies following recent regulatory and trade-war concerns. Bitcoin is showing resilience, nearing the $100K mark after a brief dip, while Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation. Solana has seen strategic investments, which could bolster confidence in its price stability above $200. Dogecoin's recent acquisition by Neptune Digital Assets suggests some speculative interest, although its price remains volatile. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, but the introduction of a stablecoin bill could provide a clearer framework for its operations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite regulatory concerns, Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with easing trade-war fears. The price nearing $100K is a positive indicator, suggesting potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Significant outflows from exchanges and record ETF volumes indicate strong accumulation and potential price support, despite recent volatility.

SOL: +0.4 — Strategic investments and a rebound above $200 suggest growing confidence and potential for upward movement, though resistance remains around $210–220.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some speculative interest with recent acquisitions, the lack of strong technical or momentum signals keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there may be a gradual rotation out of stablecoins like USDT, as investors seek higher returns in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility (VIX at 17.21) and a strong U.S. dollar (DXY at 107.96). The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after easing trade-war fears, although regulatory concerns persist. Ethereum shows bullish momentum with significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation. Solana has seen a notable rebound and increased institutional interest, while Dogecoin has experienced strategic acquisitions. Tether remains stable amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns, Bitcoin's price recovery and increased on-chain activity suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook. However, the lack of strong technical buy signals tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum with significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation. The positive sentiment from ETF volumes further supports an increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rebound above $200 and institutional interest from Sol Strategies suggest a positive outlook. The technical indicators show bullish momentum, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there are strategic acquisitions, the overall market data and technical indicators remain neutral. No significant changes warrant an adjustment in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market showing signs of recovery and increased risk appetite, a slight reduction in USDT is justified to reallocate capital towards more promising assets."
2025-02-04 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a general recovery in prices following recent regulatory concerns and trade-war fears. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards the $100K mark, driven by easing trade-war concerns. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, suggesting potential accumulation despite recent price weakness. Solana has experienced a notable rebound, supported by institutional interest, while Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions, though its price remains relatively stable. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, but the introduction of a new stablecoin bill could provide a clearer framework for its operations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, BTC's recovery towards $100K and easing trade-war fears suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook. On-chain activity remains robust, supporting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate potential accumulation, and strong ETF volumes suggest increased institutional interest. Bullish momentum signals further support a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Institutional accumulation and a strong price rebound above $200 highlight growing interest and potential upside. Positive momentum signals reinforce a strong buy preference.

DOGE: +0.2 — Strategic acquisitions and government interest provide a slight positive bias, though technical indicators remain neutral. A modest allocation increase is warranted.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive market sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-02-04 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards $100K as trade-war fears ease, although regulatory pressures remain a concern. Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or reduced selling pressure, alongside record ETF volumes suggesting heightened interest. Solana has seen strategic accumulation by investment firms, signaling confidence in its potential despite recent volatility. Dogecoin's activity remains relatively subdued, with some strategic acquisitions but no significant market-moving events. Tether remains stable, though regulatory scrutiny around its reserves continues to be a focal point.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite regulatory concerns, BTC is showing resilience with strong on-chain activity and a rebound towards $100K, indicating potential for further upward movement.

ETH: +0.8 — Significant outflows from exchanges and record ETF volumes suggest strong accumulation and interest, supporting a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Strategic accumulation by investment firms and a rebound from recent lows indicate confidence and potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Limited activity and mixed news suggest a neutral stance, with no clear signals for significant movement.

USDT: -0.3 — As market conditions improve, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with growth potential."
2025-02-04 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with signs of recovery following recent regulatory and trade-war concerns. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards $100K after a dip due to regulatory news, while Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation. Solana is gaining attention with institutional interest, and Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions, although its price remains relatively stable. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced approach, with a slight tilt towards risk assets as trade-war fears ease.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns, BTC's price recovery and easing trade-war fears suggest a cautious buy signal. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderate score.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges and strong ETF activity indicate potential accumulation and bullish sentiment, supporting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and price recovery above key support levels suggest strong buying interest, making SOL an attractive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is strategic acquisition news, technical indicators and market activity remain neutral, justifying a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases with easing trade-war concerns, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2025-02-04 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some assets showing signs of recovery from recent dips. Bitcoin has experienced volatility due to regulatory concerns but is showing resilience as trade-war fears ease. Ethereum is seeing significant outflows from exchanges, which could indicate a bullish sentiment as investors move ETH to private wallets. Solana has strong institutional interest, with recent large acquisitions suggesting confidence in its growth potential. Dogecoin's market activity is relatively stable, with some strategic acquisitions but no major price movements. Tether remains under scrutiny due to regulatory discussions, which could impact its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with easing trade-war fears, suggesting a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges and high ETF volumes indicate bullish sentiment, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and recent price recovery above key support levels suggest strong growth potential, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant market or news-driven catalysts keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases and other assets show potential for growth, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2025-02-04 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing volatility due to regulatory concerns but is showing signs of recovery as trade-war fears ease. Ethereum is seeing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation, despite recent price weakness. Solana is showing resilience with institutional interest and a price rebound from recent lows. Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions, but its price remains under pressure. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which may impact its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns, BTC is showing signs of recovery. The easing trade-war fears and nearing $100K support a modest positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and record ETF volumes indicate strong institutional interest, warranting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional buying and a price rebound above key support levels highlight strong interest and potential upside, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is strategic acquisition news, the lack of technical buy signals and recent price decrease suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive sentiment in other assets and regulatory scrutiny on Tether, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-02-04 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a recent downturn in prices across major cryptocurrencies, likely influenced by macroeconomic factors such as trade-war concerns and regulatory developments. Bitcoin has shown volatility, dipping below $97K due to regulatory news but rebounding as trade-war fears ease. Ethereum experienced significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or repositioning by investors, despite recent price weakness. Solana has seen strategic accumulation by investment firms, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. Dogecoin has been relatively stable, with some institutional interest, while Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency amid new regulatory proposals. Overall, the market shows signs of cautious optimism, with investors selectively increasing exposure to certain assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility and regulatory concerns, BTC's rebound near $100K and easing trade-war fears provide a cautiously optimistic outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges and record ETF volumes suggest accumulation and potential for upward movement, despite recent price declines.

SOL: +0.6 — Strategic accumulation by investment firms and a price rebound above $200 indicate strong buying interest and potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some institutional interest, overall sentiment and technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential capital rotation into riskier assets and regulatory scrutiny, maintaining a slightly reduced exposure to USDT is advisable."
2025-02-04 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with signs of recovery after recent declines driven by regulatory and trade-war concerns. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards $100K as trade-war fears ease, although regulatory discussions continue to weigh on sentiment. Ethereum has experienced significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation despite recent price weakness. Solana has seen institutional interest with significant purchases, supporting its price recovery above key support levels. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with minor strategic acquisitions, while Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency amidst new regulatory proposals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns, Bitcoin's rebound towards $100K and easing trade-war fears suggest a cautiously positive outlook, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges and strong ETF volumes indicate potential accumulation and investor interest, supporting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional buying and price recovery above key support levels highlight strong demand, justifying a higher preference for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some strategic acquisition, overall sentiment and technical indicators remain neutral, suggesting no change in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment improves and risk appetite increases, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to reallocate capital towards more promising assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with signs of recovery after recent declines driven by regulatory and trade-war concerns. Bitcoin is showing resilience, rebounding towards the $100K mark as trade-war fears ease. Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation despite recent price weakness. Solana has seen institutional interest, with a notable purchase by Sol Strategies, suggesting confidence in its growth potential. Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions and government interest, although its price remains relatively stable. Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency, but stablecoin regulation is gaining attention, which could impact its future dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, BTC is showing signs of recovery and resilience, with easing trade-war concerns potentially driving further gains. The regulatory news impact seems to be stabilizing.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and record ETF volumes indicate strong market interest, supporting a cautiously positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a rebound from support levels indicate strong buying interest, making SOL an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there are strategic acquisitions and government interest, the price remains stable without strong directional signals, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows signs of recovery, there is a potential rotation out of stablecoins like USDT, reducing the need for high exposure in a risk-on environment."
2025-02-05 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. economy with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.77, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index at 107.58. However, the crypto market is experiencing bearish sentiment, with most assets showing downward pressure and technical indicators signaling caution. Bitcoin faces significant resistance in the $90k–$110k range, compounded by liquidity concerns, despite strong institutional inflows into ETFs. Ethereum is underperforming amid governance concerns, while Solana shows potential strength with new DeFi developments. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether remains stable but is influenced by rising gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite strong ETF inflows, Bitcoin faces resistance and bearish technical signals, suggesting a cautious approach to reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's underperformance and governance issues warrant a reduction in exposure, as technicals do not support a bullish stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's positive developments in the DeFi space provide a slight bullish bias, although technicals remain neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-02-05 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing significant institutional interest through spot ETFs, yet facing potential downside risks due to liquidity concerns and price pressures. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance and competitive positioning, which may affect investor confidence. Solana shows promising developments with the launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform, indicating strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news, while Tether benefits from the surge in gold-backed stablecoins amidst record gold prices, suggesting a flight to safety in uncertain macroeconomic conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the risk of losing key support levels, the strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest underlying demand, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — The governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors create a slightly negative sentiment, though not enough to warrant a strong sell signal given the lack of immediate bearish technicals.

SOL: +0.5 — The successful launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform and strong DeFi activity provide a bullish signal, making Solana an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in the portfolio.

USDT: -0.3 — The rise in gold-backed stablecoins and current market conditions suggest a moderate rotation out of USDT, as investors may seek higher returns in other assets."
2025-02-05 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.77. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting positive sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into crypto. However, the U.S. Dollar Index is strong at 107.58, which might exert downward pressure on crypto prices. Bitcoin faces challenges with its price below the key $100k support level, despite strong institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is under scrutiny for governance issues, which might affect its performance. Solana shows promise with strong DeFi activity, while Dogecoin lacks significant news. Tether remains stable, with gold-backed stablecoins gaining interest amid high gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the price being under pressure, institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs is a positive sign. However, the lack of bullish technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: -0.1 — Governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors suggest caution. The technical indicators are also not supportive of a strong buy signal.

SOL: +0.5 — The launch of Raydium's perpetuals with strong early volume is a positive development, indicating increased DeFi activity and interest in Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market uncertainty and strong USD, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation could be prudent for stability and flexibility."

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with a mix of bearish technical indicators and some positive news developments. Bitcoin is facing pressure as it struggles to maintain key support levels, despite strong institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, which may affect its performance relative to competitors. Solana is seeing positive developments with the launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform, indicating growing interest in its DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether remains stable, with interest in gold-backed stablecoins rising alongside record gold prices. The macroeconomic environment, with a strong U.S. dollar and high gold prices, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite technical weakness, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs provide a supportive backdrop, warranting a cautious positive stance.

ETH: -0.3 — Governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors suggest a cautious approach, with potential for further downside.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in the DeFi space with Raydium's new platform indicate growing interest and potential for price appreciation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding current positions without additional allocation.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the cautious market sentiment and macroeconomic factors, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in stablecoins for risk management is prudent."
2025-02-05 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent dip below a key support level and the lack of bullish technical signals across major cryptocurrencies suggest a cautious market sentiment. However, institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs remains robust, which could provide some support. Ethereum faces scrutiny over its governance, potentially affecting its appeal. Solana shows promising activity in the DeFi space, while Dogecoin remains quiet with no significant news. Tether's stability is underscored by the rising interest in gold-backed stablecoins amid record gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite technical weakness, strong ETF inflows indicate institutional support, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Governance concerns and lack of bullish signals suggest a neutral stance; no immediate catalyst for upward movement.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in DeFi derivatives and strong trading volumes provide a favorable outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — Absence of significant news or technical signals keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current cautious market sentiment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2025-02-05 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. dollar and low volatility in traditional markets, which may not significantly impact crypto markets. Bitcoin is facing pressure as it struggles to maintain key support levels, despite strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, indicating mixed sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing scrutiny over its governance and performance issues, which could weigh on its price. Solana is seeing positive developments with the launch of a new DeFi product, potentially boosting its attractiveness. Dogecoin shows some positive momentum but lacks significant news to drive further gains. Tether remains stable, with some interest in gold-backed stablecoins due to rising gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite pressure on key support levels, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest underlying demand, warranting a cautious positive stance.

ETH: -0.1 — Governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors suggest a cautious approach, though recent price increases indicate some recovery.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in DeFi derivatives and strong early trading volumes provide a supportive backdrop for Solana, enhancing its attractiveness.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some positive price momentum, the absence of significant news or developments keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive developments in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more promising opportunities."
2025-02-05 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a cautious tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest through ETFs, yet faces pressure from macroeconomic factors such as tightening liquidity and strategic reserve plans. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance and underperformance compared to its peers, which may weigh on its outlook. Solana shows promise with strong DeFi activity, particularly with Raydium's new perpetuals platform. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether remains a stable option, with interest in gold-backed stablecoins rising due to record gold prices, suggesting a hedge against economic uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the pressure on price bands, the strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest a positive long-term outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — With ongoing governance concerns and underperformance, Ethereum's outlook is uncertain. A slight reduction in exposure is prudent given the mixed sentiment and technicals.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and positive developments in derivatives trading provide a bullish outlook, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin is appropriate.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions and some positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential opportunities in more volatile assets."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest through ETF inflows, yet faces pressure from macroeconomic factors and key price support challenges. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance and competitive position, which may be impacting its performance. Solana is seeing positive developments with the launch of new DeFi products, potentially boosting its attractiveness. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with interest in gold-backed stablecoins rising alongside record gold prices, indicating a potential safe-haven demand amidst broader market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite facing some bearish pressure, strong ETF inflows indicate institutional interest, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors warrant a neutral stance, despite some bullish momentum signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in the DeFi space and strong trading volumes support a favorable outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the mixed market environment, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent, but slight capital rotation into more promising assets is advisable."
2025-02-05 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is facing pressure as it struggles to maintain support in a critical price band, despite significant institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, which could impact its performance relative to competitors. Solana shows potential with the launch of a new derivatives platform, indicating growing interest in its DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether benefits from the surge in gold prices, reflecting a cautious approach in the broader market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite strong ETF inflows, Bitcoin's struggle to hold key support levels and bearish macroeconomic signals suggest caution.

ETH: +0.1 — While facing governance issues, Ethereum's bullish momentum and slight price recovery indicate a neutral to slightly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong early volume in Solana's new derivatives platform suggests increased interest and potential for growth, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains a hold.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market sentiment and Bitcoin's potential downside, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2025-02-05 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by stable yet cautious sentiment, with the 10-Year Treasury Yield at 4.43% and the U.S. Dollar Index at 107.58, indicating a relatively strong dollar. The S&P 500 is at 6061.48, showing resilience, while gold prices are at an all-time high, reflecting some risk aversion. In the crypto market, Bitcoin faces pressure as it struggles to maintain key support levels, although institutional interest remains strong with significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance, impacting its competitive stance. Solana shows promise with strong DeFi activity, while Dogecoin lacks significant news. Tether benefits from the surge in gold-backed stablecoins amid high gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite strong institutional inflows, Bitcoin is struggling to maintain key support levels, and the overall market sentiment is cautious, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing governance scrutiny and underperforming competitors, leading to a neutral stance as technical indicators show mixed momentum.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive developments in DeFi derivatives and stable on-chain activity support a moderate increase in allocation, indicating potential growth.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Dogecoin remains a hold with no clear directional bias.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment and high gold prices, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT provides a hedge against volatility."
2025-02-05 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing governance criticism, Ethereum shows bullish momentum in technical indicators, warranting a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DeFi activity with Raydium's new platform supports a positive outlook, despite no significant price movement.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a slight preference for stability is prudent."
2025-02-05 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of institutional interest through significant inflows into spot ETFs, despite facing some resistance in a key price band. Ethereum is experiencing scrutiny over its governance and performance, which may affect its attractiveness. Solana is gaining traction in the DeFi space with the launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform, indicating potential growth in trading activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether remains stable, with some interest in gold-backed variants due to rising gold prices, suggesting a hedge against market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite facing resistance, the strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs indicate sustained demand, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing governance scrutiny, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — The launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform and strong early volume suggest increased interest and potential growth, supporting a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains a hold.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall positive sentiment and potential for growth in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin facing pressure due to macroeconomic factors and Ethereum under scrutiny for its governance issues. Despite these challenges, Ethereum maintains a bullish technical outlook. Solana is experiencing positive momentum from DeFi developments, while Dogecoin remains stable without significant news. The macroeconomic context, with high gold prices and a stable U.S. Dollar Index, suggests a cautious approach, with potential for capital rotation into more stable assets like USDT if volatility increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest via ETFs, Bitcoin faces downward pressure from macroeconomic factors and technical resistance, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish technical indicators and a strong on-chain activity suggest potential upside, despite governance concerns. Maintain a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong DeFi activity and positive developments in derivatives trading support a bullish view, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintain a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for increased volatility, a slight increase in stablecoin allocation is prudent to manage risk."
2025-02-05 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. economy with moderate volatility, as indicated by a relatively low VIX and a strong S&P 500. The U.S. Dollar Index remains high, suggesting a strong dollar, which can impact crypto markets by reducing the attractiveness of non-dollar assets. Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest through spot ETFs, although it faces pressure due to liquidity concerns and price support challenges. Ethereum is underperforming amid governance criticism, while Solana is gaining traction in DeFi derivatives. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether is stable, with gold-backed stablecoins seeing increased interest due to record gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are a positive signal, but price support challenges warrant caution. Overall, the momentum and on-chain activity are supportive.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite governance concerns, Ethereum's technical indicators show bullish momentum. The market cap and volume remain strong, suggesting potential for growth.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong performance in DeFi derivatives and consistent on-chain activity make it an attractive option, with potential for further upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral. Its recent price movements do not indicate a strong directional bias.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall positive sentiment in the crypto market, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with growth potential."
2025-02-05 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed sentiment with a relatively stable U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a cautious risk appetite among investors. Bitcoin is experiencing sustained institutional demand through ETF inflows, though it faces potential downside pressure due to liquidity concerns. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance, which could affect its long-term appeal. Solana is gaining traction in the DeFi space with new product launches, while Dogecoin remains stable without significant news. Tether and other gold-backed stablecoins are seeing increased interest due to rising gold prices, indicating a potential shift towards safe-haven assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional demand through ETF inflows supports a positive outlook, despite some downside risk from liquidity issues. The overall bullish momentum and on-chain activity are favorable.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite governance concerns, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and strong on-chain activity, warranting a cautious but positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — The launch of new DeFi products and strong trading volumes position Solana as an attractive asset, supported by its growing ecosystem.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the current risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2025-02-05 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate stability with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. dollar, which could exert pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing mixed signals with strong institutional inflows into ETFs but faces technical resistance in key price bands. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance and performance issues, while Solana shows potential with new DeFi developments. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news, and Tether is stable but seeing interest in its gold-backed variant due to rising gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite technical resistance, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest continued interest, warranting a slight positive bias.

ETH: -0.1 — Governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors suggest caution, though technical indicators remain positive.

SOL: +0.5 — The launch of Solana-based perpetuals with strong volume indicates growing DeFi activity, supporting a more bullish stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintain a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed signals in the market, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is suggested to capitalize on potential opportunities in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by relatively stable conditions, with the S&P 500 and gold prices indicating a balanced risk sentiment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains high, which could exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is facing significant resistance below its key support level, despite strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, while Solana is gaining traction in the DeFi space with new derivatives offerings. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether remains stable, though gold-backed stablecoins are seeing increased interest due to rising gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite short-term price pressure, strong ETF inflows indicate institutional interest, suggesting potential for recovery if macro conditions stabilize.

ETH: 0.0 — Governance concerns and underperformance relative to peers create uncertainty, balancing out its technical buy signals.

SOL: +0.5 — The launch of Raydium's perpetuals and strong trading volume provide a bullish outlook, positioning Solana as a growing player in DeFi.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.2 — With some positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-02-05 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin showing strong institutional interest through ETF inflows, yet facing potential downside risks due to macroeconomic pressures and liquidity concerns. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance and competitive positioning, which may affect its performance. Solana is experiencing positive developments with the launch of a new derivatives platform, indicating increased DeFi activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news, while Tether benefits from rising gold prices, highlighting its role as a safe haven amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the risk of losing support, strong ETF inflows indicate sustained institutional interest, suggesting potential for future gains.

ETH: -0.1 — Governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors create uncertainty, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in the DeFi space with Raydium's new platform boost Solana's attractiveness, despite recent price declines.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased interest in riskier assets like BTC and SOL, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains."
2025-02-05 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bearish undertones. Bitcoin is experiencing downward pressure, struggling to maintain key support levels, despite strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is facing scrutiny over its governance and underperformance compared to competitors, which could weigh on its attractiveness. Solana is seeing positive developments with the launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform, indicating strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and its technical indicators are bearish. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, but the broader macroeconomic context, with high gold prices and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite current price pressure, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest potential for recovery. Maintain a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Governance concerns and underperformance create uncertainty. Hold current position until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DeFi activity and positive news from Raydium's platform launch support a bullish stance. Increase exposure slightly.

DOGE: -0.2 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure slightly, given current holdings.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of market uncertainty and bearish signals in other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and flexibility."
2025-02-05 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which might exert pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing mixed signals with institutional interest via ETFs but faces technical challenges below key price levels. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, which could impact its market perception. Solana shows promise with increased DeFi activity, while Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news. Tether's role as a safe haven is bolstered by rising gold prices, suggesting a cautious market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are a positive sign, though technical challenges below the $100k level warrant caution. The overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a buy signal from trend indicators, governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DeFi activity and positive developments in derivatives trading provide a bullish outlook, making Solana relatively attractive in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral in the portfolio.

USDT: -0.2 — While the market shows some caution, the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2025-02-05 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin facing pressure due to macroeconomic factors and liquidity concerns, despite strong institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is experiencing scrutiny over its governance, which may impact its competitive position. Solana is seeing positive developments with the launch of a new derivatives platform, indicating strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, Tether and other gold-backed stablecoins are gaining interest amid rising gold prices, suggesting a hedging sentiment in the market. The macroeconomic indicators show a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, which may not strongly favor risk-on or risk-off strategies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the pressure on Bitcoin's price, the strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest underlying support. However, caution is warranted due to macroeconomic pressures.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors create uncertainty, balancing out the buy signal from technical indicators.

SOL: +0.5 — The positive news from Raydium's new platform and consistent on-chain activity support a favorable outlook for Solana, suggesting potential for growth in the DeFi space.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a hedge against market uncertainty."
2025-02-05 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by relatively stable conditions, with a moderate U.S. dollar index and low volatility as indicated by the VIX. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin is under pressure, with its price dipping below key support levels, despite strong institutional demand via ETFs. Ethereum is facing scrutiny over its governance and performance compared to competitors. Solana is showing promise with increased DeFi activity, while Dogecoin lacks significant news. Tether's stability is underscored by the rise in gold-backed stablecoins amid record gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite strong ETF inflows, Bitcoin is struggling to maintain key support levels, suggesting potential downside risk. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, with governance concerns creating uncertainty. Maintaining current exposure seems prudent until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in DeFi derivatives and stable on-chain activity suggest potential upside, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, Dogecoin remains a hold, reflecting its current neutral position in the portfolio.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a defensive stance, allowing flexibility to capitalize on future opportunities."
2025-02-05 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a relatively stable U.S. dollar and low volatility, with the S&P 500 maintaining high levels, indicating a generally positive risk sentiment. However, gold prices have surged, suggesting some underlying market caution.
