2025-01-30 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has spurred a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also experienced price increases, reflecting broader market optimism. Meanwhile, Dogecoin's potential for an ETF approval has been highlighted, suggesting possible future institutional interest. Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network is a strategic move to enhance its utility for cross-network payments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, bolstered by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news. The bullish sentiment is likely to continue, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader crypto rally and positive price momentum. While not as strong as BTC, it remains a favorable asset to hold given the current market conditions.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana has outperformed in the recent market upswing, showing significant price increases and strong momentum. It is well-positioned to capture further gains in this bullish environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has potential for future institutional interest, current on-chain activity is low. However, the speculative news around ETF possibilities provides a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish trends, there is a shift away from stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in more volatile assets. Reducing USDT exposure is advisable to capitalize on the positive market sentiment."
2025-01-30 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing positive momentum, with Solana notably outperforming its peers. Dogecoin is gaining speculative interest due to potential ETF developments, while Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network signals innovation in stablecoin utility. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a strong S&P 500, supports risk-on sentiment, suggesting a favorable climate for crypto investments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum, coupled with significant ETF inflows and bullish news, makes it a highly attractive asset in the current market environment.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from the broader market rally and positive price action, although its momentum is slightly less pronounced than Bitcoin's.

SOL: +0.9 — Solana's significant price increase and outperforming nature during the rally, along with positive news, make it the most attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has some speculative interest due to potential ETF developments, its price action is less compelling compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current risk-on sentiment and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on the bullish market conditions."
2025-01-30 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has spurred a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has benefited from significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, while Ethereum and Solana have also seen significant price increases due to the broader market optimism. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to potential ETF developments, which could enhance its institutional appeal. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin and Lightning networks suggests a focus on improving cross-network payment efficiency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing a strong upward trend supported by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news. The recent price surge and bullish momentum signals suggest continued growth potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the overall market rally and positive price momentum. The price breakout above the Bollinger Bands indicates potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.9 — Solana is outperforming its peers with significant price increases and strong momentum signals. The news of its market outperformance further supports a strong buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin is showing signs of increased activity and potential institutional interest due to ETF speculation, warranting a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing its relative attractiveness in the current market environment."
2025-01-30 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled optimism across the crypto space. Bitcoin has seen a significant rally, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing upward momentum, with Solana notably outperforming its peers. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to speculation about potential ETF developments, while Tether continues to expand its utility by launching on the Bitcoin/Lightning network. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong S&P 500, supports a risk-on environment, encouraging capital allocation into cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic conditions. Bitcoin's price is showing signs of a breakout, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and positive sentiment, with technical indicators supporting continued upward movement. It remains a solid choice for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.9 — Solana is experiencing significant price increases and outperforming other assets, driven by strong market momentum and positive news. It is the most attractive asset for increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is seeing some positive sentiment due to ETF speculation, its overall activity and momentum are less compelling compared to other assets. A moderate increase in allocation is justified.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is rotating out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets. A reduction in USDT holdings is appropriate to capitalize on the bullish market environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled optimism across the crypto space. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader market rally, with Solana notably outperforming other assets. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to speculation about potential ETF approvals, while Tether is expanding its reach with new integrations on the Bitcoin and Lightning networks, enhancing its utility for cross-network payments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news. The bullish sentiment and institutional interest make it a favorable asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is benefiting from the market-wide rally and positive price action. While not as strong as Bitcoin, it remains an attractive option for capital allocation due to its solid fundamentals and market position.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's significant price increase and outperformance during the rally indicate strong momentum. The asset's technical indicators and market sentiment support a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has seen some positive speculation regarding potential ETF approval, its overall market activity and sentiment are less compelling than other assets. A modest increase in allocation is warranted.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish market conditions, there is a shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings. A decrease in USDT allocation aligns with the increased risk appetite."
2025-01-30 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has led to a surge in Bitcoin and broader crypto markets. Bitcoin has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the positive market environment, with notable price increases. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to potential ETF developments, while Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network suggests increased utility and demand for stablecoins. Despite the bullish sentiment, the macroeconomic indicators, such as the high U.S. dollar index and stable gold prices, suggest a cautious approach to risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news. Bitcoin's price is breaking out, indicating potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the market-wide rally and has strong technical indicators. The price increase aligns with broader crypto optimism.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana is outperforming in the current market upswing, with significant price gains and strong technical signals, making it an attractive asset.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has potential upside due to ETF speculation, its technical indicators are less compelling than other assets, warranting a moderate positive score.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high stablecoin exposure."
2025-01-30 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's pause on rate hikes, which has boosted investor confidence across the crypto space. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also experienced price increases, benefiting from the broader market rally. Dogecoin's potential for future ETF approval suggests growing institutional interest, while Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its ongoing utility and adoption.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and bullish macroeconomic news. The positive sentiment and technical indicators suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Benefiting from the market-wide rally and positive price action. Technical indicators remain bullish, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Outperforming in the current market upswing with strong price momentum and positive news. The asset's technical strength justifies increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation around potential ETF approval provides a positive sentiment boost, though technical indicators are less compelling than other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2025-01-30 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has boosted investor confidence and led to a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen significant inflows into ETFs, indicating strong institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also experienced price increases, with Solana notably outperforming its peers. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to speculation about potential ETF approval, which could increase institutional interest. Meanwhile, Tether has expanded its presence by launching on the Bitcoin/Lightning network, although its role as a stablecoin means it typically sees less price volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The combination of strong ETF inflows and bullish technical indicators suggests a robust upward momentum, making Bitcoin an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from the broader market rally and positive price momentum, supported by bullish news and technical indicators.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's significant price outperformance and strong technical signals make it a compelling option for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin's technical indicators are positive, the speculative nature of potential ETF approval warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT, reducing its relative attractiveness in the current market environment."
2025-01-30 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's pause on rate hikes, which has boosted investor confidence and led to significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This has resulted in a rally across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana showing strong upward momentum. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader crypto rally, with Solana notably outperforming its peers. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest due to potential ETF developments, while Tether is expanding its utility through integration with the Bitcoin/Lightning network, although it remains a stable asset in a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and significant ETF inflows suggest continued upward momentum. The macroeconomic environment is supportive of further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive price action and market optimism following the Fed's decision support a bullish outlook, although not as strong as Bitcoin's.

SOL: +0.7 — Outperformance in the recent rally and strong technical indicators make Solana an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest around potential ETF developments provides a moderate buy signal, but low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into riskier assets with higher potential returns."
2025-01-30 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's pause on rate hikes, which has boosted investor confidence across the crypto market. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing upward momentum, with Solana notably outperforming its peers. Dogecoin's potential for ETF approval adds a speculative edge, while Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its strategic growth in cross-network payments. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with no immediate threats to the bullish trend.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and ETF inflows, combined with bullish news, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from the broader market rally and positive price momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current bullish climate.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's outperformance and strong technical indicators position it well for capital allocation, supported by recent price gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While DOGE has low on-chain activity, the potential for ETF approval adds a speculative upside, warranting a moderate positive score.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2025-01-30 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest, while Ethereum and Solana have also experienced price increases amid broader market optimism. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to potential ETF developments, which could enhance its institutional appeal. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network suggests a focus on improving cross-network payment efficiency.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is benefiting from strong institutional inflows and positive macroeconomic developments, such as the Fed's pause on rate hikes. The bullish momentum and ETF-related news further support an increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is experiencing a price surge amid a broader crypto rally, supported by positive market sentiment. The technical indicators are favorable, justifying a moderately increased allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana has outperformed during the recent market upswing, and the positive news sentiment supports its continued strength. The technical indicators are also bullish, warranting a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has shown significant price increases and potential ETF developments, the overall market activity is less robust compared to other assets. A cautious increase in allocation is justified.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a shift in capital from stablecoins to more volatile assets. Reducing USDT exposure aligns with the increased risk appetite."
2025-01-30 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has boosted investor confidence and led to significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This has positively impacted Bitcoin's price, which has seen a notable rally. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing upward price movements, supported by the broader crypto market rally. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to speculation about potential ETF approvals, which could increase institutional interest. Meanwhile, Tether's integration with the Bitcoin/Lightning network is a strategic move to enhance its utility, though it hasn't significantly impacted its price stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and news of ETF inflows suggest continued upward momentum. The macroeconomic context, with the Fed's pause, further supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and technical buy signals. The recent price increase and positive sentiment support a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana is outperforming in the current market upswing, with strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment. This suggests a favorable environment for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has seen significant price increases and speculation about ETF potential, the lack of concrete developments keeps the score moderate. However, the bullish momentum warrants some positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a shift away from stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2025-01-30 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has increased investor confidence and led to significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This has positively impacted Bitcoin's price, pushing it above $105K. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader crypto rally, with Ethereum experiencing a price surge and Solana outperforming many competitors. Dogecoin is gaining speculative interest due to potential ETF developments, while Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin and Lightning networks highlights its ongoing utility in cross-network payments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and positive news regarding ETF activity provide a bullish outlook. Despite slight recent price decreases, the overall trend remains upward.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and maintains bullish momentum. The recent price increase and positive sentiment support a favorable allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana is outperforming in the current market upswing, with strong technical indicators and positive news sentiment. It remains an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has experienced some price volatility, the potential for ETF developments adds a speculative upside, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish market sentiment, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2025-01-30 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's pause on rate hikes, which has sparked renewed investor confidence and inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. This positive macroeconomic backdrop is reflected in the recent price increases across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, while Ethereum and Solana are benefiting from the broader crypto rally. Dogecoin's potential for an ETF wrapper suggests growing institutional interest, although its technical indicators show mixed signals. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but less attractive in a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news support a bullish outlook. On-chain activity also shows increased transactions, indicating heightened interest.

ETH: +0.6 — Benefiting from the broader crypto rally and positive momentum signals. The macro environment and technical indicators support further gains.

SOL: +0.7 — Outperforming in the market upswing with strong technical signals and positive news sentiment. Volume and on-chain activity are supportive.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculation about potential ETF approval provides a positive sentiment boost, although technical indicators are mixed.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2025-01-30 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has increased investor confidence and led to a rally in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest, while Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader market upswing. Dogecoin is gaining attention due to potential ETF developments, which could enhance its institutional appeal. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its ongoing efforts to improve cross-network payments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional inflows and positive sentiment following the Fed's pause on rate hikes. The ETF-related news further supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and maintains bullish momentum in both price and on-chain activity, suggesting continued upward potential.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana is outperforming in the current market upswing, supported by strong technical indicators and positive news, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin's technical indicators are positive, the potential for an ETF could enhance its institutional appeal, warranting a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into riskier assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL, reducing USDT exposure is prudent to capitalize on the bullish market conditions."
2025-01-30 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled optimism across the crypto sector. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge, supported by strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also experienced price increases, benefiting from the broader market rally. Meanwhile, Dogecoin's potential for an ETF wrapper suggests possible future institutional traction. Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its ongoing efforts to enhance cross-network payments. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a strong S&P 500, further supports a risk-on sentiment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and significant ETF inflows signal robust institutional demand, making it a preferred asset in the current bullish environment.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from the broader market rally and maintains bullish momentum, supported by positive price action and on-chain activity.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's outperformance in the market upswing and strong technical indicators suggest continued upward potential, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin's activity remains low, speculation about an ETF path provides potential upside, justifying a modest positive score.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent in the current market context."
2025-01-30 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong performance in the recent market upswing and bullish momentum signal a favorable outlook, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative ETF news, Dogecoin's low on-chain activity and recent price decrease suggest a neutral stance.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a pause in Fed rate hikes, which has positively influenced the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, driving a broader market rally. Bitcoin's price has been buoyed by significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, while Ethereum has also benefited from the overall market optimism. Solana has outperformed other assets during this upswing, reflecting heightened investor interest. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is experiencing speculative interest regarding potential ETF developments, although its on-chain activity remains low. Tether's integration with the Bitcoin/Lightning network suggests a strategic move to enhance its utility for cross-network payments. Overall, the market sentiment is bullish, with increased risk appetite reflected in the reduced demand for stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional inflows and price support from ETF news, suggesting a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and positive price momentum, although not as strongly as Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price performance and market outperformance signal a strong buy, supported by the recent upswing and positive sentiment.

DOGE: 0.1 — While there is speculative interest in potential ETF developments, low on-chain activity and mixed signals suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, maintaining a lower allocation in USDT is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has bolstered investor confidence and led to a rally in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader market upswing, while Dogecoin's potential for an ETF wrapper suggests growing institutional traction. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its ongoing efforts to enhance cross-network payment capabilities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and positive sentiment from ETF news support a bullish outlook. The macroeconomic context is favorable, with the Fed's pause on rate hikes boosting confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally and positive price momentum. The recent price increase and bullish sentiment suggest further upside potential.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's significant outperformance during the market upswing and positive news sentiment make it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is potential for institutional traction with ETF speculation, current on-chain activity remains low. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2025-01-30 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes, which has fueled a rally across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has shown resilience with strong ETF inflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. Ethereum and Solana have also benefited from the broader market upswing, with Solana outperforming its peers. Dogecoin is seeing speculative interest due to potential ETF developments, while Tether's expansion onto the Bitcoin/Lightning network highlights its role in facilitating cross-network transactions. Despite the positive sentiment, the market remains volatile, as indicated by fluctuating prices and mixed technical signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong ETF inflows and positive news sentiment suggest continued upward momentum, although technical indicators are mixed.

ETH: +0.4 — Ethereum is benefiting from the broader market rally, with positive news sentiment and a recent price increase, though technical momentum is not yet strong.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's significant outperformance and positive market sentiment justify a favorable allocation, despite the lack of strong technical momentum.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative interest due to potential ETF developments, the lack of strong technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent, though it remains a safe haven in case of market reversals."
2025-01-31 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a mixed environment with relatively stable interest rates and moderate volatility. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which may pressure crypto assets. Bitcoin is facing headwinds due to geopolitical tensions and tariff announcements, which have dampened its recent rally. Ethereum is showing signs of strength, breaking key resistance levels and benefiting from increased stablecoin activity on its network. Solana is gaining momentum, supported by strong app revenues and bullish sentiment. Dogecoin is experiencing increased derivatives activity and positive sentiment due to new investment products. USDT faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its technological reach with planned Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent geopolitical news and the potential for increased volatility suggest caution. Despite on-chain activity, the macro environment and technical signals are not strongly supportive.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum from breaking resistance and strong stablecoin ecosystem support. The potential for a move toward $4,000 makes it relatively attractive.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment and strong app revenue support a positive outlook. The potential for a rally toward $250 adds to its appeal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products provide a speculative boost, though the overall market environment remains cautious.

USDT: 0.0 — While regulatory challenges exist, its role as a stablecoin remains crucial in uncertain market conditions. No significant reallocation is warranted at this time."
2025-01-31 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across different assets. Bitcoin is facing headwinds due to new tariffs impacting its recent rally, and a sharp drop in volatility suggests a significant move may be on the horizon. Ethereum is showing strength, breaking above key resistance levels and benefiting from increased stablecoin adoption. Solana is gaining momentum with bullish technicals and strong app revenue performance, hinting at potential further gains. Dogecoin is experiencing increased derivatives activity and speculation of a rally, bolstered by Grayscale's new investment trust. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its reach with planned Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent tariff news and volatility drop suggest caution, with potential downside risk. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong technical breakout and positive news on stablecoin adoption indicate potential for further gains. Increasing exposure is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and strong app revenue performance support a positive outlook. Increasing allocation is advisable.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased derivatives activity and Grayscale's trust introduction provide a mild positive sentiment, but not enough for a strong buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite regulatory challenges, USDT remains stable. No immediate need to adjust current holdings significantly."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing downward pressure due to geopolitical tensions and new tariffs, which have halted its recent rally. However, a potential large price movement is anticipated due to a collapse in volatility. Ethereum shows resilience, breaking key resistance levels and benefiting from increased stablecoin adoption, suggesting a bullish outlook. Solana is gaining momentum with positive news on app revenues and price targets, indicating potential for further gains. Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity and speculation of a rally, supported by new investment products. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its network capabilities, maintaining its role as a stable asset amidst market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent geopolitical tensions and tariffs have negatively impacted Bitcoin, with technical indicators suggesting potential further downside. However, a volatility collapse hints at a possible large move, warranting caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is showing strength by breaking resistance levels and benefiting from stablecoin adoption, indicating potential for further gains. Positive sentiment and technical indicators support a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's bullish momentum and positive news on app revenues and price targets suggest strong potential for upward movement, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While derivatives activity and new investment products are supportive, the overall market sentiment remains cautious. A slight positive allocation is warranted given the potential for speculative rallies.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite regulatory challenges in the EU, USDT remains a stable asset. With mixed market conditions, maintaining current exposure is prudent while monitoring developments."
2025-01-31 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index. Bitcoin's recent rally has been halted by geopolitical tensions and new tariffs, while Ethereum is showing signs of strength, driven by stablecoin adoption and potential ETF demand. Solana is gaining momentum with increased app revenues, and Dogecoin is experiencing heightened interest due to new investment products and rising derivatives activity. USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, which could impact its demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent tariff news has interrupted BTC's rally, and technical indicators do not show strong bullish signals. Given the potential for volatility, a cautious stance is warranted.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum shows positive momentum with potential for further gains, driven by strong fundamentals and rising demand from stablecoin ecosystems and ETFs.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is showing resilience with a potential target of $250, supported by strong app revenue growth and positive news sentiment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products suggest potential for upward movement, although technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.1 — While USDT remains a stable option, regulatory challenges in Europe and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in exposure."
2025-01-31 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.43. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong at 108.37, which could exert downward pressure on crypto assets. Bitcoin is experiencing a pullback due to new tariffs impacting market sentiment, while Ethereum is showing resilience with potential for further gains driven by stablecoin adoption and ETF demand. Solana is gaining traction with bullish technicals and increased app revenues, suggesting potential upward movement. Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity, hinting at a possible rally, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its utility through Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent tariffs and low activity levels are weighing on Bitcoin, with technical indicators suggesting potential for further downside. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price decreases, Ethereum's strong technical position and positive news regarding stablecoin adoption and ETF interest support a moderately bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's technical indicators and news of increased app revenues suggest a potential upward movement, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Rising derivatives activity and positive sentiment from Grayscale's new trust indicate potential for a rally, justifying a modest increase in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed macroeconomic signals and ongoing regulatory challenges, maintaining current USDT levels provides a balanced approach to managing risk in the portfolio."
2025-01-31 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a cautious tone. Bitcoin is facing headwinds due to geopolitical factors like new tariffs, which have stalled its recent rally. However, the drop in volatility suggests a significant price move could be on the horizon. Ethereum is showing signs of strength, breaking key resistance levels and benefiting from increased stablecoin activity on its network, which could drive further gains. Solana is also gaining momentum, with bullish technical signals and increased app-generated revenue, suggesting potential for further upside. Dogecoin is experiencing increased derivatives activity and positive sentiment due to new investment products, which could lead to a rally. Meanwhile, Tether is facing regulatory challenges in the EU but is planning to expand its reach with Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite potential for a big move, current geopolitical pressures and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Maintain reduced exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking key resistance with strong structural support from stablecoin adoption. Favorable outlook for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive technical signals and increased app revenue suggest potential upside. Maintain a moderately bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products could drive a rally. Moderate positive sentiment.

USDT: -0.1 — Regulatory challenges in the EU are a concern, but overall stablecoin demand remains steady. Slightly reduce exposure in favor of riskier assets."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed picture, with moderate volatility in the S&P 500 and a strong U.S. Dollar Index, which could exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a stall in its rally due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs, while Ethereum shows potential for further gains driven by strong demand for stablecoins and ETF interest. Solana is gaining traction with positive news on app revenues and technical support levels, suggesting potential upside. Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity and institutional interest, which could lead to price appreciation. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its utility through the Lightning Network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite increased on-chain activity, the macroeconomic environment and recent tariff news are likely to limit upside potential. Holding a small position is prudent given current uncertainties.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong technical signals and positive news on stablecoin adoption and ETF demand suggest a favorable outlook. Increasing exposure is justified.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive momentum from app revenue growth and technical support levels, combined with bullish news, supports a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Rising derivatives activity and institutional interest from Grayscale's new trust could drive a rally, warranting a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains a safe haven, the regulatory challenges in Europe and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in allocation."
2025-01-31 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bullish signals for Ethereum and Solana, while Bitcoin and Dogecoin face uncertainties. Bitcoin's recent rally has been hindered by geopolitical developments, such as new tariffs, and a looming volatility shift suggests potential price swings. Ethereum shows resilience, buoyed by stablecoin adoption and technical breakouts, with analysts eyeing further gains. Solana is gaining traction with increased app revenues and bullish price targets, while Dogecoin sees heightened interest due to new investment products and derivatives activity. USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, though its integration with the Lightning Network could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite potential volatility and geopolitical pressures, Bitcoin's current technical indicators do not suggest a strong directional move. Holding the current position seems prudent.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum demonstrates bullish momentum with key resistance levels broken and strong fundamentals from stablecoin adoption. Increasing exposure is justified.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive news on app revenues and technical support levels suggests potential for upward movement, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin benefits from increased derivatives activity and new investment products, the lack of strong technical signals suggests only a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With regulatory challenges in Europe and a generally stable market environment, reducing USDT exposure slightly in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2025-01-31 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility, suggesting a relatively calm market backdrop. Bitcoin is facing headwinds due to new tariffs impacting its recent rally, while Ethereum shows potential for a breakout driven by increased ETF demand and stablecoin adoption. Solana is gaining momentum with strong app revenue growth, and Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity, indicating potential for a rally. Tether faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its reach with Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent tariff news has halted Bitcoin's rally and increased uncertainty, suggesting a cautious approach despite potential volatility ahead.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from breaking key resistance levels and strong stablecoin ecosystem support indicates potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and strong app revenue growth support a positive outlook, with potential for further price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased derivatives activity and Grayscale's new trust suggest growing interest, though the price remains relatively stable.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive sentiment in other assets, there's a slight shift away from stablecoins as risk appetite increases."
2025-01-31 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Ethereum showing signs of potential breakout momentum and Solana regaining strength. Ethereum's recent price movement above key resistance levels and the growing adoption of stablecoins on its network are driving positive sentiment. Solana is also experiencing bullish momentum with potential targets set higher due to increased app-generated revenues. Bitcoin, however, faces uncertainty due to macroeconomic factors like new tariffs, which have dampened its recent rally. Dogecoin is seeing increased interest from institutional investors, which could lead to a rally, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its reach with planned Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite potential for a large price movement, macroeconomic pressures and recent volatility suggest a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking above resistance and strong fundamentals from stablecoin adoption support a positive outlook, with potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive momentum and increased app revenues indicate potential for upward movement, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Institutional interest and rising derivatives activity suggest potential for a rally, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — While regulatory challenges exist, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent given market uncertainties, but a slight reduction is justified as risk appetite increases."
2025-01-31 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Ethereum and Solana showing signs of potential bullish momentum. Ethereum has broken key resistance levels and is benefiting from increased stablecoin adoption, suggesting a potential move towards $4,000. Solana, similarly, has regained momentum with bullish technical signals and increased app revenue, indicating a possible rally towards $250. Bitcoin, however, faces headwinds from macroeconomic developments, such as new tariffs, which have dampened its recent rally. Dogecoin is seeing increased interest due to new investment products and rising derivatives activity, which could lead to a breakout. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its technological capabilities with planned Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite potential for a big move due to low volatility, macroeconomic factors like tariffs are currently weighing on sentiment, leading to a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong technical breakout above resistance and positive news regarding stablecoin adoption suggest further upside potential.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish technical indicators and increased app revenue support a positive outlook, with potential for further gains towards $250.

DOGE: +0.4 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment products are supportive, with potential for a breakout rally.

USDT: -0.3 — Regulatory challenges in Europe and positive sentiment in riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2025-01-31 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Ethereum and Solana showing signs of bullish momentum. Ethereum has broken above key resistance levels, driven by increased demand for ETFs and stablecoin activity on its network. Solana is also gaining momentum, with analysts projecting potential price targets due to increased app revenues. Bitcoin, however, faces headwinds from geopolitical tensions and tariff announcements, which have dampened its recent rally. Dogecoin is experiencing heightened derivatives activity and speculation of a potential breakout, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its reach through Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite potential for a large move due to low volatility, geopolitical tensions and tariff news create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news on breaking resistance levels suggest further upside potential, making it an attractive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish reversal and positive news on app revenue growth support a moderate increase in allocation, with potential upside towards $250.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and speculation of a breakout rally provide a modestly positive outlook, justifying a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish sentiment in ETH and SOL, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in these assets."
2025-01-31 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Ethereum and Solana showing signs of potential breakouts, driven by strong technical indicators and positive news. Ethereum has broken above key resistance levels, supported by increasing stablecoin adoption and ETF demand, while Solana is gaining momentum with a bullish reversal and increased app-generated revenue. Bitcoin faces some headwinds due to macroeconomic factors, such as new tariffs affecting its rally, but a potential large price movement is anticipated due to low volatility. Dogecoin is experiencing increased derivatives activity and speculation about a potential rally, supported by the launch of a Grayscale investment trust. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its reach through planned integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite macroeconomic challenges, the low volatility suggests a potential large movement, and maintaining a small positive bias could capture upside potential.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news about breaking resistance and stablecoin adoption make ETH highly attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news about app revenues and potential price targets support a favorable allocation to SOL.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased derivatives activity and positive sentiment from the Grayscale trust launch suggest potential for upward movement, warranting a modest positive score.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains a stable option, the overall market sentiment leans towards risk assets, and regulatory challenges in the EU suggest a slight reduction in exposure."
2025-01-31 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed picture with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, which could exert pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. However, the relatively low volatility index suggests a stable market environment. In the crypto space, Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum, driven by technical breakouts and increased stablecoin adoption on its network. Solana is also gaining traction with positive news on app revenues and potential price targets. Dogecoin is experiencing increased derivatives activity and positive sentiment due to new investment products. Bitcoin, however, faces headwinds from geopolitical news affecting its recent rally. USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Bitcoin is facing negative sentiment due to geopolitical tensions and a lack of bullish technical signals. The market appears cautious, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

**ETH: +0.8** — Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum with technical breakouts and positive news on stablecoin adoption, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

**SOL: +0.5** — Solana's positive news on app revenues and potential price targets, combined with bullish momentum, supports a moderate increase in allocation.

**DOGE: +0.3** — Despite recent price volatility, increased derivatives activity and new investment products provide a positive outlook, justifying a slight increase in exposure.

**USDT: -0.3** — With positive momentum in other cryptocurrencies and regulatory challenges in Europe, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on risk-on sentiment."

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with signs of bullish momentum across several major cryptocurrencies, particularly ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Ethereum is showing strong upward momentum, driven by technical breakouts and increased demand from the stablecoin ecosystem. Solana is also gaining traction, with bullish reversals and increased app revenues suggesting potential for further gains. Dogecoin is experiencing heightened interest, fueled by the launch of a Grayscale investment trust and increased derivatives activity. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is experiencing a temporary setback due to geopolitical factors, but technical indicators suggest a potential for a significant move. USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, although its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent setbacks from geopolitical news, there is potential for a significant move as indicated by low volatility. Maintain a moderate positive stance given its foundational role in the portfolio.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding resistance breakouts and stablecoin adoption make ETH highly attractive. Increase allocation to capitalize on potential upside.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and increased app revenues suggest further gains. The bullish reversal above key support levels supports a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased derivatives activity and the introduction of a Grayscale trust indicate growing interest and potential for a rally. Moderate positive allocation is warranted.

USDT: -0.3 — While USDT remains a stable asset, regulatory challenges in Europe and a general shift towards riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in allocation to free up capital for more promising opportunities."
2025-01-31 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable yet cautious sentiment, with the U.S. Dollar Index remaining strong and the S&P 500 showing resilience. In the crypto market, Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum, driven by technical breakouts and increased stablecoin activity on its network. Solana is also gaining traction with positive news on app revenues and technical indicators suggesting a potential rally. Dogecoin is experiencing increased derivatives activity and positive sentiment due to Grayscale's new investment trust. Bitcoin is experiencing a pullback due to geopolitical factors but shows potential for a significant move due to low volatility. USDT remains stable, but regulatory challenges in Europe are noteworthy.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent pullbacks due to geopolitical news, the low volatility suggests a potential for a significant move. Maintain a moderate positive outlook given its foundational role in the portfolio.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news about stablecoin adoption and ETF demand suggest a bullish outlook. Ethereum's momentum and structural strength make it a priority for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and news about app revenue growth support a bullish stance. Solana's potential for a rally towards $250 makes it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Increased derivatives activity and positive sentiment from Grayscale's new trust support a bullish outlook. The potential for a breakout rally makes DOGE a candidate for increased exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Regulatory challenges in Europe and the bullish sentiment in other assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital towards more promising opportunities."
2025-01-31 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of bullish momentum. Ethereum has broken above key resistance levels, supported by strong demand for stablecoins on its network, and is eyeing further gains. Solana is experiencing a bullish reversal, with analysts projecting significant upside potential due to increased app-generated revenue. Dogecoin is gaining attention with rising derivatives activity and the launch of a new investment trust, suggesting potential for further rallies. Meanwhile, Bitcoin faces headwinds from geopolitical developments, such as new tariffs, which have tempered its recent rally. USDT remains stable, but regulatory changes in the EU and planned integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network are noteworthy.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent setbacks from geopolitical news, Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest potential for a significant move. However, caution is warranted due to external pressures.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum is showing strong upward momentum, breaking key resistance levels, and benefiting from increased stablecoin activity on its network, making it an attractive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is experiencing a bullish reversal and increased app revenue, indicating strong potential for further gains. The technical setup supports a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — With rising derivatives activity and the introduction of a new investment trust, Dogecoin is positioned for potential breakout rallies, making it a favorable asset in the current environment.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains a stable asset, the overall market conditions suggest a slight rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2025-01-31 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin faces headwinds due to geopolitical tensions and new tariffs, which have led to a reversal in its recent rally. Ethereum is showing strong momentum, driven by its break above key resistance levels and increased demand for its blockchain ecosystem, particularly in stablecoins. Solana is experiencing a bullish reversal with potential for further gains, supported by strong app revenue growth. Dogecoin is gaining attention with increased derivatives activity and the launch of a new investment trust, suggesting potential for a rally. Meanwhile, USDT is facing regulatory challenges in Europe, but its integration into the Bitcoin Lightning Network could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent geopolitical developments and tariff announcements have dampened Bitcoin's rally, and technical indicators suggest potential downside risk. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong technical momentum and positive news around stablecoin adoption and ETF demand support a favorable outlook. Increasing exposure aligns with its current trajectory.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's bullish reversal and strong app revenue growth indicate potential for further gains. Maintaining or slightly increasing exposure is advisable.

DOGE: +0.3 — Rising derivatives activity and the launch of a new investment trust suggest increased interest and potential for a rally. A moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — Regulatory challenges in Europe and a potential shift towards riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in USDT holdings, reallocating capital to more promising opportunities."
2025-01-31 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, with the VIX at 16.43, and a strong U.S. dollar index at 108.37, which might exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent price decline is influenced by new tariffs, while Ethereum shows resilience, breaking key resistance levels with strong momentum. Solana is experiencing a bullish reversal, driven by increased app revenues, while Dogecoin sees heightened interest from derivatives activity and a new investment trust. Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe but plans to enhance its network capabilities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and macroeconomic pressures, such as tariffs, suggest caution. Despite potential for a big move, the current sentiment is bearish.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong momentum and breaking key resistance levels, coupled with positive news on stablecoin adoption, make ETH attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and positive news on app revenues suggest potential for further gains, making it a favorable asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased derivatives activity and new investment trust support a modest bullish outlook, though the overall market sentiment remains mixed.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market volatility and regulatory challenges, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a pullback due to macroeconomic pressures, such as new tariffs, and a potential large price movement is anticipated due to collapsing volatility. Ethereum is showing strength, breaking key resistance levels, driven by stablecoin adoption and positive momentum. Solana is regaining momentum with bullish projections, supported by strong app revenues. Dogecoin is seeing increased interest and speculation due to new investment products and rising derivatives activity. Meanwhile, USDT is facing regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its technological capabilities with planned Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite potential for a large move, current macroeconomic pressures and recent price decreases suggest caution. Holding a small position is prudent given the volatility.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and positive news around stablecoin adoption and potential price breakout make ETH attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and positive revenue news support a moderate increase in allocation, anticipating a move towards higher price targets.

DOGE: +0.3 — Rising derivatives activity and new investment products suggest potential for a rally, warranting a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.2 — While regulatory challenges exist, maintaining a stablecoin position is wise for risk management, but slight reduction is justified to capitalize on opportunities in other assets."
2025-01-31 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.43. However, the U.S. dollar index is strong at 108.37, which could exert downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a downturn due to geopolitical tensions and new tariffs, while Ethereum shows resilience with potential upward momentum driven by ETF demand and stablecoin adoption. Solana is showing signs of recovery, with potential for further gains due to increased app revenues. Dogecoin is gaining traction with new investment products and increased derivatives activity, suggesting potential for a rally. Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe but is expanding its technological capabilities with Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is under pressure from geopolitical tensions and tariffs, with technical indicators suggesting a potential breakdown. Current holdings should be reduced.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is showing strong technical signals and positive news flow, with potential for further gains driven by ETF demand and stablecoin adoption.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana is showing signs of recovery with positive news on app revenues and potential for further gains, but technical indicators are still weak.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin is benefiting from increased derivatives activity and new investment products, suggesting potential for a rally despite mixed technical signals.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market environment, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent to manage risk while assessing further developments."
2025-01-31 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 16.43. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong at 108.37, which could exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight downturn, influenced by new tariffs and low volatility, suggesting a potential for a significant move. Ethereum is showing bullish signs, breaking key resistance levels with positive momentum driven by stablecoin adoption. Solana is gaining traction with increased app revenues and a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is seeing increased interest due to Grayscale's new investment trust and rising derivatives activity. USDT faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its network capabilities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Current bearish sentiment due to tariff news and low volatility suggests caution. Existing holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum and structural strength from stablecoin adoption support an increased allocation, with potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish reversal and strong app revenue growth indicate a favorable outlook, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Rising derivatives activity and institutional interest through Grayscale's trust support a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — While regulatory challenges exist, maintaining a stable allocation is prudent given the current market uncertainty, with a slight reduction to capitalize on bullish trends in other assets."
2025-01-31 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which may exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a period of low volatility, suggesting a potential significant price movement soon, while recent tariffs have negatively impacted its rally. Ethereum is showing resilience, breaking key resistance levels, and is supported by growing stablecoin adoption. Solana is gaining momentum with bullish technical indicators and increased app revenue, suggesting potential for further gains. Dogecoin is seeing increased derivatives activity and institutional interest, which could lead to a breakout. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in the EU but is expanding its utility with planned Lightning Network integration.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the potential for a significant price movement, the recent negative impact from tariffs and lack of clear bullish signals suggest a neutral stance for now.

ETH: +0.6 — Breaking above key resistance and strong fundamentals from stablecoin growth indicate a favorable outlook, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive momentum and revenue growth provide a bullish outlook, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Rising derivatives activity and institutional interest through Grayscale's trust support a slightly bullish stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With regulatory challenges in the EU and a generally bullish sentiment for other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures, such as the imposition of tariffs by the U.S., which has led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been affected significantly, dropping to around $100,000. Ethereum, however, shows resilience, having surged over 2% recently, indicating some bullish sentiment. Solana is showing signs of a potential rebound after hitting a key support level, supported by increased stablecoin inflows. Dogecoin remains stable within a narrow trading range, with discussions around its potential to reach higher resistance levels. Tether continues to show strength in issuance and profitability, although regulatory changes in the EEA could impact its future use.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent tariffs have negatively impacted Bitcoin's price, and technical indicators do not suggest a bullish reversal. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, Ethereum's recent price surge and positive news suggest a potential for continued upward movement. Increasing exposure is warranted.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's bounce off a critical support level and increased stablecoin inflows indicate potential bullish momentum. A moderate increase in allocation is recommended.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin remains stable with no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: -0.2 — While Tether remains strong, the overall market conditions suggest a slight rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets. Reduce exposure slightly."
2025-02-01 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 17.16, and a strong U.S. dollar index at 108.58. This backdrop, coupled with geopolitical tensions reflected in tariffs imposed by the U.S., has led to a market-wide pullback, particularly affecting Bitcoin. Despite this, Ethereum has shown resilience, breaking above the $3,300 level, supported by positive news and technical signals. Solana is experiencing increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting potential bullish momentum, while Dogecoin remains range-bound with speculative discussions about its path to $1. Tether continues to demonstrate strong issuance and profitability, though regulatory concerns in the EEA could impact its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The imposition of tariffs has triggered a sell-off, and technical indicators do not support a bullish stance. Given current holdings, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite mixed technical signals, Ethereum's recent price rally and positive news sentiment suggest potential for further gains, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Stablecoin inflows and a bounce off key support levels indicate potential bullish momentum, making it an attractive candidate for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative discussions, Dogecoin remains range-bound with no clear technical or news-driven catalysts to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — While regulatory concerns in the EEA may impact its use, the overall market environment suggests maintaining some exposure to stablecoins for risk management, but with a slight reduction to capitalize on opportunities in other assets."
2025-02-01 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 17.16. However, the U.S. Dollar Index is high at 108.58, suggesting a strong dollar, which might put pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has faced a recent sell-off due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs, causing a dip to around $100,000. Ethereum has shown some resilience, breaking above the $3,300 mark, while Solana is experiencing increased stablecoin inflows and potential bullish momentum after hitting a key support level. Dogecoin remains in a consolidation phase with speculative discussions about its path to $1. Tether continues to show strong issuance and profitability, though regulatory challenges in the EEA are emerging.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent sell-off due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs suggests caution. The lack of bullish technical signals supports reducing exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technicals, Ethereum's recent price rally and resilience above $3,300 indicate potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from key support levels suggest an opportunity for upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — Consolidation within a defined range and mixed sentiment from analysts provide no clear directional signal.

USDT: +0.4 — With geopolitical uncertainties and Bitcoin's recent dip, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a hedge against volatility."
2025-02-01 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, with the S&P 500 and gold prices indicating a relatively stable backdrop. However, the U.S. Dollar Index is high, which could exert downward pressure on crypto assets. Bitcoin has experienced a slight decline due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs, while Ethereum has shown some resilience, breaking above $3,300. Solana is seeing increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin remains range-bound, with discussions around its potential to reach $1. Tether is stable, though regulatory changes in the EU could impact its use in certain regions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent tariffs have negatively impacted Bitcoin, causing a dip in price. The lack of bullish technical signals suggests a cautious approach, reducing exposure slightly.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, Ethereum's recent price rally and positive news sentiment provide a moderate buy signal, indicating potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong stablecoin inflows and a bounce off key support levels suggest bullish momentum, making Solana an attractive option for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in technical indicators or news sentiment, Dogecoin remains neutral. The potential for a breakout is noted but not imminent.

USDT: -0.2 — While generally stable, the potential regulatory impact in the EU and the current market environment suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to allocate capital to more promising assets."

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with macroeconomic factors such as increased tariffs leading to a pullback in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been affected by broader market concerns, trading around $100,000 due to geopolitical tensions. Ethereum shows some resilience, breaking above $3,300, supported by a recent rally. Solana is experiencing increased stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound after hitting a key support level, suggesting some bullish sentiment. Dogecoin remains range-bound, with discussions around its potential to reach $1 if it can break through resistance levels. Tether continues to show strength with significant profits and issuance, although regulatory changes in the EEA may impact its usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The market-wide pullback due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs suggests caution. Despite holding BTC, reducing exposure slightly in favor of more stable assets is prudent.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent rally above $3,300 and positive sentiment make it relatively attractive, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound after hitting support levels indicate a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some positive sentiment, DOGE remains range-bound with no clear breakout, suggesting a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current cautious market environment, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT as a hedge against volatility is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, with the U.S. imposing tariffs that have triggered a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been affected, dipping to around $100,000, reflecting broader market concerns. Ethereum shows resilience, having recently crossed the $3,300 mark, indicating some bullish sentiment. Solana is experiencing a potential rebound off a key support level, bolstered by increased stablecoin inflows and DEX activity. Dogecoin remains range-bound, with discussions around its potential path to $1, though sentiment is mixed. Tether remains stable, but regulatory changes in the EEA could impact its future demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the lack of strong technical signals, recent price resilience and positive news support a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment from key support rebound and significant stablecoin inflows suggest a favorable outlook, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment and lack of clear technical direction suggest maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and potential regulatory impacts, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2025-02-01 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 17.16. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong at 108.58, which could exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Recent market data reflects a mixed sentiment across cryptocurrencies, with slight price decreases and no strong buy signals from technical indicators. Bitcoin has experienced a sell-off due to geopolitical tensions, while Ethereum shows resilience with a recent rally above $3,300. Solana is showing potential bullish momentum after bouncing off a key support level, supported by increased stablecoin inflows. Dogecoin remains in a consolidation phase with potential upside if it breaks key resistance levels. Tether remains stable, but regulatory concerns in the EEA could impact its future use.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent sell-off triggered by geopolitical tensions and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current environment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technicals, Ethereum's recent rally and resilience above $3,300 indicate potential for further gains. Moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news about stablecoin inflows and a rebound from key support suggest a bullish outlook. Increasing exposure to capitalize on potential upward momentum.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in data or sentiment and ongoing consolidation, maintaining current exposure is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and potential regulatory impacts on other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven."
2025-02-01 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, as evidenced by the VIX at 17.16, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index at 108.58, which typically pressures risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. have triggered a market-wide pullback, affecting Bitcoin and altcoins negatively. Bitcoin has dipped to around $100,000, reflecting broader market concerns. Ethereum has shown some resilience, with a recent rally pushing it above $3,300, although technical indicators remain mixed. Solana is experiencing increased stablecoin inflows and has bounced off a key support level, suggesting potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin's outlook remains uncertain, with discussions around its path to $1 contingent on breaking key resistance levels. Tether continues to show strength with significant profits and issuance, although regulatory challenges in the EEA could impact its usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — The recent sell-off triggered by geopolitical tensions and tariffs has pressured Bitcoin, with no clear technical buy signals. Holding a small position is prudent, given the current uncertainty.

**ETH: +0.2** — Despite mixed technicals, Ethereum's recent rally above $3,300 and relatively stable on-chain activity suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook. A slight increase in allocation is warranted.

**SOL: +0.5** — Solana's rebound from key support levels and significant stablecoin inflows indicate potential bullish momentum. The increased DEX activity further supports a positive allocation stance.

**DOGE: -0.1** — Dogecoin's technical indicators remain weak, and the price is trading within a narrow range. Given the current holdings, a slight reduction is advised to manage risk.

**USDT: +0.3** — In light of the current market volatility and geopolitical risks, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against further downside in risk assets."
2025-02-01 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 17.16, and a strong U.S. dollar index at 108.58, which generally exerts downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The recent imposition of tariffs by the U.S. President has triggered a market-wide sell-off, notably affecting Bitcoin, which has dipped to around $100,000. Ethereum, however, has shown some resilience, recently breaking above $3,300. Solana has bounced off a key support level, with increased stablecoin inflows suggesting potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin remains in a narrow trading range, with speculative discussions about its path to $1. Tether continues to show strong issuance and profitability, although regulatory concerns in the EEA could impact its market presence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, Ethereum's ability to break above $3,300 and its relatively stable technical indicators warrant a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from a key support bounce and significant stablecoin inflows indicate potential for upward movement, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant changes in technical indicators or news, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — In light of market volatility and Bitcoin's downturn, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against further market instability."
2025-02-01 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with macroeconomic factors such as new tariffs causing a broad market pullback, particularly impacting Bitcoin, which has seen a significant decline. Ethereum has shown some resilience with a recent price rally, but technical indicators remain neutral. Solana is experiencing mixed signals, with a recent bounce off a key support level and increased stablecoin inflows suggesting potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin is facing downward pressure, trading below critical levels, while analysts debate its path to higher resistance. Tether remains a stable option, although regulatory changes in the EEA could impact its future availability on certain platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, despite holding a small amount.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's recent price rally above $3,300 and relatively stable technical indicators warrant a slight increase in allocation, reflecting cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.5 — The bounce off a critical support level and significant stablecoin inflows indicate potential for a rebound, making Solana an attractive option for increased capital allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Trading below the lower Bollinger Band and facing significant price declines, Dogecoin's outlook remains uncertain, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market volatility and regulatory uncertainties, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as new tariffs imposed by the U.S. President, which have led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping to around $100,000. Ethereum, however, has shown some resilience with a recent rally above $3,300, but technical indicators remain weak. Solana has seen increased stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from a key support level, suggesting some optimism. Dogecoin is trading within a narrow range, with discussions around its potential path to $1. Meanwhile, Tether has reported strong profits and issuance, but faces regulatory challenges in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin in the short term.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the recent rally above $3,300, technical indicators are not supportive enough for a strong buy signal, but the price resilience warrants a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.5 — The bounce off a key support level and significant stablecoin inflows indicate potential for a rebound, making Solana relatively attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Trading within a narrow range with no clear bullish or bearish signals; maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current bearish market sentiment, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven amidst volatility."
2025-02-01 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. However, the recent imposition of tariffs by the U.S. President has triggered a market-wide pullback, affecting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable dip, while Ethereum has shown some resilience by breaking above the $3,300 mark. Solana is seeing increased stablecoin inflows, suggesting potential bullish momentum, while Dogecoin remains in a tight trading range with potential upside if it can break resistance. Tether continues to strengthen its position with significant profits and issuance, although regulatory challenges in the EEA may impact its future.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent tariff-induced sell-off has created downward pressure on Bitcoin, and technical indicators show no bullish signals. Holding a small position, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the lack of strong technical buy signals, Ethereum's recent price resilience and positive news suggest a slight increase in allocation could be beneficial.

SOL: +0.5 — The combination of a rebound from key support levels and increased stablecoin inflows indicates potential bullish momentum, warranting a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin remains in a narrow trading range with no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators, suggesting a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market uncertainty and recent profits reported by Tether, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against volatility."
2025-02-01 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with recent macroeconomic developments such as tariffs imposed by the U.S. affecting the broader market and causing a pullback in Bitcoin's price. Ethereum has shown resilience, breaking above the $3,300 mark, driven by positive momentum. Solana is experiencing a rebound, supported by increased stablecoin inflows and DEX activity, suggesting potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin remains in a range, with discussions around its potential to reach $1, though it faces resistance. Tether's strong financial performance is overshadowed by regulatory challenges in the EEA, affecting its sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent macroeconomic pressures and a lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach, though the current holding is minimal.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive price movement and breaking key levels indicate potential for further gains, supported by recent news of a rally.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased stablecoin inflows and positive sentiment from traders suggest bullish momentum, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite discussions around its path to $1, current technicals and sentiment remain neutral, warranting a hold.

USDT: +0.2 — While regulatory concerns exist, the current market environment suggests maintaining a stable position in USDT for risk management."
2025-02-01 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is mixed, with macroeconomic pressures such as tariffs affecting Bitcoin negatively, causing a dip in its price. Ethereum has shown resilience, breaking above the $3,300 mark, indicating some bullish sentiment. Solana is experiencing a potential rebound after hitting a key support level, bolstered by increased stablecoin inflows and DEX activity. Dogecoin is trading within a narrow range, with discussions around its potential to reach $1, though it remains speculative. Tether remains stable, but regulatory changes in the EEA could impact its usage in that region. Overall, the market is showing signs of cautious optimism, with some assets poised for potential gains while others are under macroeconomic pressure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technicals, Ethereum's recent price rally and breaking above $3,300 provide a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from technical support and increased stablecoin inflows suggest potential upside, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Trading within a narrow range with no significant news or technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.1 — While generally a safe haven, the potential regulatory impact in the EEA is a concern, but it remains a stable option amid market uncertainty."
2025-02-01 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with macroeconomic pressures such as new tariffs causing a pullback in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Despite this, Ethereum has shown resilience, breaking above the $3,300 mark, indicating some bullish sentiment. Solana has seen increased stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from key support levels, suggesting optimism among traders. Dogecoin remains in a consolidation phase, with discussions around its potential to reach $1, though it faces significant resistance. Tether continues to show strength with substantial profits and issuance, but regulatory changes in the EU could impact its usage in certain regions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent tariff news has negatively impacted Bitcoin, causing a dip in price. Despite some bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic context suggests caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's recent price rally and break above $3,300 indicate potential for further gains, though the technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news regarding stablecoin inflows and a bounce from key support levels suggest a potential rebound, making it relatively attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite discussions about its potential to reach $1, Dogecoin remains in a range with no significant changes in data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.2 — Although Tether remains strong, the potential regulatory impact in the EU and overall market conditions suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings as risk appetite may increase."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with macroeconomic factors such as new tariffs causing a pullback in Bitcoin and broader market volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a dip due to these tariffs, while Ethereum has shown some resilience with a recent rally above $3,300. Solana is seeing increased activity and stablecoin inflows, suggesting potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin is trading within a narrow range, with discussions around its potential to reach $1 if it breaks key resistance levels. Tether remains stable, though regulatory changes in the EU are prompting some exchanges to delist it, which could affect its liquidity in the region.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of current holdings suggest a cautious approach, maintaining a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Recent price rally and positive news suggest some upward potential, though technical indicators remain mixed, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Increased stablecoin inflows and a bounce off key support levels indicate potential for upward movement, making it relatively attractive for allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Trading within a narrow range with no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential bullish opportunities in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on risk assets."
2025-02-01 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by increased volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which may exert downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant dip due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs, while Ethereum has shown some resilience with a recent rally above $3,300. Solana is attracting attention with increased stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from key support levels. Dogecoin remains range-bound with speculative discussions about its path to $1. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in the EEA, which could impact its utility in that region.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip due to geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin's on-chain activity shows a surge in transactions and active wallets, suggesting underlying interest and potential for recovery.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's recent rally above $3,300 and stable on-chain activity indicate a positive outlook, making it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increased stablecoin inflows and potential rebound from key support levels suggest bullish momentum, making it a strong candidate for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin remains range-bound with no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets like ETH and SOL, and regulatory challenges in the EEA, reducing exposure to USDT seems prudent."
2025-02-01 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with macroeconomic factors such as new tariffs impacting overall market confidence, causing a pullback in Bitcoin's price. Ethereum has shown resilience with a recent rally, although it remains below key resistance levels. Solana is experiencing increased stablecoin inflows and has bounced off a critical support level, suggesting potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin's outlook is uncertain, with predictions of modest declines and debates on its path to $1. Tether remains stable, though regulatory changes in the EEA could impact its future utility. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by high volatility and strong USD, suggests cautious optimism with selective risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of a buy signal from trend indicators suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.2 — Recent price rally and crossing of the 3,300 USDT mark indicate potential for further gains, but lack of strong bullish signals warrants a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and a rebound from key support levels suggest a favorable outlook. Increased DEX activity supports a stronger allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with no clear bullish momentum and ongoing debates about its path to $1. Maintain current holdings without changes.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market volatility and regulatory concerns, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a hedge against market uncertainty."
2025-02-01 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 17.16. However, the recent imposition of tariffs by the U.S. President has triggered a market-wide pullback, impacting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a dip to around $100,000, while Ethereum has shown some resilience, recently breaking above $3,300. Solana is showing signs of a potential rebound after hitting a key support level, and there is notable stablecoin inflow into the Solana ecosystem. Dogecoin remains in a tight trading range, with discussions around its potential to reach $1, contingent on breaking key resistance levels. Tether continues to demonstrate strong issuance and profitability, though regulatory challenges in the EEA could affect its market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of a clear buy signal suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

**ETH: +0.2** — Ethereum's recent price surge above $3,300 and increased on-chain activity provide a modestly positive outlook, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

**SOL: +0.5** — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from key support levels suggest a favorable outlook. Increased DEX activity further supports a higher allocation.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With no significant changes in technical or news sentiment and a stable trading range, maintaining the current position is appropriate.

**USDT: +0.1** — Given the current market uncertainty and potential regulatory impacts, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against volatility."

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as increased tariffs imposed by the U.S. on major trade partners, which has led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been notably affected, dropping to around $100,000. Ethereum recently experienced a brief rally but has since faced a decline, while Solana shows potential for a rebound after hitting a key support level. Dogecoin remains range-bound, with discussions around its potential to reach $1 if it can break through significant resistance. Meanwhile, Tether's strong financial performance is overshadowed by regulatory challenges in the EEA, leading to its delisting from Kraken's platform.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic environment and recent tariff-induced sell-off suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent rally followed by a decline and technical indicators not showing a clear direction. Hold current position.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and a potential rebound from key support levels suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Trading within a narrow range with no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators. Maintain current position.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current bearish market conditions and regulatory challenges, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2025-02-01 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. President, which has led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping to around $100,000. Ethereum showed some resilience with a recent rally, but technical indicators suggest a potential breakdown. Solana has seen increased stablecoin inflows and a bounce off a key support level, indicating potential bullish momentum. Dogecoin remains in a tight trading range, with discussions around its potential path to $1. Tether continues to show strength with significant profits and issuance, although regulatory challenges in the EEA could impact its availability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price decline and bearish macroeconomic news suggest reducing exposure. Despite bullish momentum signals, the overall market sentiment is negative.

ETH: -0.3 — Although there was a recent rally, the price is now below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential for further downside. Mixed technical signals warrant caution.

SOL: +0.3 — Increased stablecoin inflows and a bounce off key support provide a positive outlook, though caution is advised due to overall market conditions.

DOGE: 0.0 — Trading within a narrow range with no clear directional signals. Awaiting further developments or news to provide a clearer outlook.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market sentiment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to mitigate risk."
2025-02-01 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as new tariffs imposed by the U.S. President, which have led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has seen a significant dip, dragging down altcoins as well. Ethereum recently experienced a brief rally, but its price remains under pressure. Solana shows potential for a rebound after hitting a key support level, supported by increased stablecoin inflows. Dogecoin is trading in a narrow range, with mixed forecasts about its potential to reach higher resistance levels. Tether remains stable, but regulatory concerns in the EEA could impact its future availability on certain platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish on-chain activity, the recent tariff-induced sell-off and lack of a buy signal suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Recent rally above $3,300 was short-lived, and technical indicators remain weak. Holding current position as sentiment is mixed.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and potential rebound from support level provide a moderate buy signal, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Trading within a narrow range with no clear bullish or bearish signals. Maintaining current exposure as sentiment is neutral.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and potential regulatory impacts, increasing stablecoin holdings to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-01 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the imposition of tariffs by the U.S., which has led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has experienced a significant dip, dragging down the broader crypto market. Ethereum showed some resilience with a brief rally above $3,300, but overall technical indicators remain weak. Solana has shown signs of potential recovery, supported by increased stablecoin inflows and DEX activity. Dogecoin is trading within a narrow range, with analysts debating its potential path to higher resistance levels. Tether remains stable, although regulatory changes in the EU could impact its usage in the region.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish on-chain activity, the broader market pullback and lack of a buy signal suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: 0.0 — Recent rally above $3,300 is offset by weak technical indicators and mixed sentiment. Hold current position.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news on stablecoin inflows and potential rebound at key support levels suggest a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: -0.1 — Trading within a narrow range with no clear bullish signals. Slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-02-01 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. President, which has led to a market-wide pullback. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping to around $100,000. Ethereum, despite a recent rally, is experiencing downward pressure, while Solana shows potential for a rebound after hitting a key support level. Dogecoin's outlook remains uncertain, with discussions around its potential path to $1. Tether is experiencing regulatory challenges in the EEA but continues to show strong issuance and profitability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The market-wide pullback and recent tariff news have negatively impacted Bitcoin, suggesting a need to reduce exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally, Ethereum's technical indicators remain weak, and the bearish macro environment warrants a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's potential rebound from a key support level and increased stablecoin inflows indicate a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: -0.2 — With no significant positive developments and a bearish market environment, a slight reduction in exposure is advisable.

USDT: +0.4 — In the current bearish market, maintaining a higher USDT exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as new U.S. tariffs and escalating trade tensions, which have negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced significant downward pressure, dropping below $95K, while Ethereum has seen a similar decline of approximately 5.6%. Despite a slight recovery in the last hour, the broader trend remains uncertain. Other cryptocurrencies like Solana and Dogecoin have also shown price declines, though without significant news catalysts. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are likely to see increased demand as investors seek safety amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight recovery, Bitcoin remains under pressure from macroeconomic factors and recent news of trade tensions. Holding a small position is prudent given the overall bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum's recent price drop and bearish technical indicators suggest caution. The lack of a clear recovery signal warrants a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's price has been volatile, but without significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's recent price movements do not indicate a clear trend or sentiment shift, suggesting a hold position is suitable.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market sentiment and volatility, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-02 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as trade tensions and recent U.S. tariffs, which have led to a market-wide sell-off. Bitcoin has been significantly affected, dropping below $95K, and Ethereum has also seen a notable decline. The technical indicators across BTC, ETH, and SOL suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with prices hovering around or below lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. Despite the bearish sentiment, DOGE and SOL have shown some resilience with minor price increases in the last hour, although they still lack strong bullish signals. USDT remains stable, reflecting a cautious market environment where investors might be seeking refuge in stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Given the recent price drop and negative news sentiment, reducing exposure to BTC is prudent. The lack of bullish technical signals further supports this decision.

ETH: -0.3 — Similar to BTC, ETH is experiencing downward pressure with no clear technical support. The broader market downturn and recent price decline justify a cautious stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Although SOL has shown some price recovery, the absence of significant news and weak technical indicators suggest maintaining a neutral position.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a slight price increase, DOGE lacks strong technical or news-driven catalysts to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-02 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment reflects a mixed sentiment with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing a downturn, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing bearish signals both in price and technical indicators. Bitcoin has been impacted by global trade tensions, leading to a significant price drop. Ethereum has similarly faced a decline, exacerbated by broader market conditions. Solana and Dogecoin have not seen significant news but are following the general market trend with price decreases. Tether remains stable, with bullish momentum, suggesting a flight to safety amidst market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Given the recent price breakdown and negative sentiment due to trade-war jitters, reducing exposure is prudent to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant price drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest maintaining a cautious stance with a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana's price movements are in line with the market downturn. Holding the current position is advisable until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed price movements, maintaining the current position seems appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — The stability and bullish momentum in USDT indicate a preference for safety, making it an attractive option to increase exposure amidst current market volatility."
2025-02-02 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a significant sell-off in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin dropping below $95K and Ethereum down by approximately 5.6%. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE show no bullish signals, with several assets breaking below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. In contrast, USDT shows bullish momentum, suggesting a flight to safety as investors seek stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent news and technical indicators suggest continued bearish pressure. Despite holding a small amount, reducing exposure is prudent given the current market environment.

ETH: -0.3 — Similar to BTC, Ethereum is facing significant downward pressure with no immediate bullish signals. Reducing exposure slightly is advisable.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to warrant a change in position. Holding steady given the lack of clear direction.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and technical indicators showing bearish trends, maintaining the current position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.8 — Bullish momentum and a stable price regime make USDT an attractive option for capital preservation in the current bearish market. Increasing exposure to USDT is recommended to safeguard against further market declines."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a significant sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping to a three-week low amid these developments. Ethereum has also experienced a notable decline, reflecting the broader market downturn. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE are predominantly negative, with prices breaking below lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential further downside. In contrast, USDT shows bullish momentum, suggesting a flight to safety as investors seek stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent price drop below significant support levels and negative news sentiment suggest further downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current bearish environment.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's significant price decline and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a cautious approach. Slight reduction in exposure is advised.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the absence of significant news, SOL's technical indicators are negative. However, without major bearish news, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintaining a neutral position is suitable until clearer trends emerge.

USDT: +0.8 — The bullish momentum and increased demand for stability amid market uncertainty make USDT an attractive asset for capital preservation. Increasing exposure is recommended."
2025-02-02 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as rising U.S. tariffs and trade tensions, which have led to significant declines in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop below $95K, reflecting heightened investor concerns. Ethereum has also faced a downturn, decreasing by approximately 5.6%. Despite some slight recoveries in the last hour, technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE remain weak, with no clear buy signals. USDT, as a stablecoin, shows relative strength, indicating a preference for safety amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Continued bearish sentiment and technical weakness, compounded by negative news related to trade tensions, suggest reducing exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Similar to BTC, Ethereum is facing downward pressure with no clear technical support, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, the lack of significant news and ongoing technical weakness suggest a neutral position.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there was a slight price recovery, the absence of significant news and weak technical indicators justify maintaining the current position.

USDT: +0.8 — Given the bearish market conditions and preference for safety, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital."
2025-02-02 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by macroeconomic concerns such as trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping to a three-week low amid these developments. Ethereum has also seen a significant decline, aligning with the broader market downturn. Despite some minor recoveries in the past few hours, the technical indicators remain weak across most assets, with no strong buy signals. In contrast, USDT shows bullish momentum, suggesting a flight to safety as investors seek stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant price drop and bearish macroeconomic news suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, despite a slight recovery in the last few hours.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's recent decline and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a cautious stance, with a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a minor price increase, Solana lacks significant news or strong technical indicators to justify a change in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news or technical changes, suggesting a hold position.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-02-02 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and bearish sentiment, largely driven by macroeconomic factors such as trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs. Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline, falling below $95K, with further pressure as Asian markets opened. Ethereum has also seen a notable drop, reflecting the broader market downturn. Despite these challenges, stablecoins like USDT are maintaining their stability, indicating a potential flight to safety among investors. Technical indicators across most cryptocurrencies suggest a lack of bullish momentum, with many assets trading within normal ranges or below key support levels.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Given the recent price decline and negative news sentiment, Bitcoin appears vulnerable. Despite no current holdings, the macroeconomic environment suggests caution.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum has experienced a significant drop, and technical indicators do not show a strong recovery signal. Current holdings should be cautiously monitored.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals suggest a change in position. Maintain current holdings as the market assesses broader conditions.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, there is no compelling reason to adjust the current position at this time.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of market volatility and bearish sentiment, increasing exposure to USDT can provide a safe haven, reflecting a defensive stance in the current environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic tensions, particularly the ongoing trade war, which has led to a significant sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin dropping below $95K and Ethereum down by approximately 5.6%. Despite these declines, Solana and Dogecoin have shown some resilience with slight price increases in recent hours, although technical indicators remain weak. The stablecoin USDT is maintaining its stability, reflecting a cautious market environment where investors might be seeking safety amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Given the recent sell-off and negative news surrounding trade tensions, Bitcoin appears less attractive. The lack of bullish technical signals further supports a cautious stance.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's recent price drop and lack of positive momentum suggest reducing exposure. The broader market downturn adds to the bearish sentiment.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana's recent price increases and normal on-chain activity provide a slightly positive outlook, warranting a modest allocation increase.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows mixed signals with no significant news or technical indicators to drive a strong allocation decision. Maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-02 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping below significant levels amid these concerns. Ethereum has also seen a notable decline, reflecting the broader market downturn. In contrast, Solana and Dogecoin have not experienced significant news-driven movements, while Tether remains stable, indicating a potential flight to safety as investors seek to preserve capital amid uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The bearish macroeconomic environment and recent sell-off, along with negative news, suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, especially given the absence of a current holding.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's recent price decline and lack of bullish technical indicators warrant a cautious approach, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite the lack of significant news, Solana's recent price increase and positive momentum signal provide a slight bullish bias, justifying a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral, suggesting no change in current exposure.

USDT: +0.7 — In light of the bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to maintain liquidity and reduce risk, as indicated by the stablecoin's bullish momentum signals."
2025-02-02 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility and uncertainty, as evidenced by the elevated VIX and significant movements in major indices. The crypto market is experiencing a bearish sentiment, primarily driven by macroeconomic concerns such as trade tensions, which have led to a sell-off in risk assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, with recent news highlighting its drop below key psychological levels due to global trade-war jitters. Ethereum has also faced downward pressure, losing significant value amid the broader market decline. Solana shows some resilience with bullish momentum signals despite the lack of significant news, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no major developments. Tether, as a stablecoin, continues to serve as a safe haven amidst market turbulence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent sell-off and negative news, Bitcoin's on-chain activity remains robust, suggesting potential resilience. However, the lack of bullish technical signals warrants a neutral stance.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from the broader market downturn and lacks positive momentum signals. Given current holdings, reducing exposure slightly is prudent.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana shows positive momentum despite the market downturn, with bullish technical indicators suggesting potential upside. Increasing exposure is justified.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news or technical changes. Maintaining current exposure is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-02 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as rising trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant declines, with Bitcoin dropping below $95K and Ethereum down by approximately 5.6%. Despite the negative sentiment, Solana shows some resilience with bullish momentum signals, while Dogecoin and USDT remain relatively stable without significant news impacts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.4 — The market is bearish due to trade-war jitters and recent price declines. With no current holdings, a negative score is not applicable, but caution is advised.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent significant price drop and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate further downside risk.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the overall bearish market, Solana shows bullish momentum and a recent price increase, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment; maintain current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining or increasing stablecoin holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment reflects heightened volatility, with the S&P 500 at elevated levels and the U.S. Dollar Index showing strength. This backdrop, coupled with recent news of escalating trade tensions, has contributed to a bearish sentiment in the crypto market. Bitcoin has experienced significant downward pressure, dropping below key psychological levels due to global trade-war jitters. Ethereum has also been affected by the broader market downturn, experiencing a notable decline. Solana and Dogecoin have not been significantly impacted by specific news, but they are following the general market trend. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option as investors seek refuge from volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing significant downward pressure due to macroeconomic factors and trade-war news, suggesting a cautious approach with reduced exposure.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's decline aligns with the broader market downturn, and with existing holdings, it is prudent to reduce exposure slightly.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the overall market downturn, Solana's technical indicators show some bullish momentum, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin has seen a consistent decline without significant news, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure to manage risk.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and preserves capital amidst volatility."
2025-02-02 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as the escalation of trade tensions, which have led to a broader market sell-off. Bitcoin has been significantly impacted, dropping to a three-week low amid these concerns. Ethereum has also experienced a notable decline, reflecting the broader market downturn. Despite the negative sentiment, Solana and Dogecoin have shown some resilience with recent price increases, although they remain under pressure from the prevailing market conditions. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid the volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price recovery, the macroeconomic environment and negative news sentiment suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, so maintaining a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.2 — Although Ethereum has faced recent sell pressure, its slight recovery and ongoing bullish momentum signal suggest a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent price increase and sustained bullish momentum signal make it relatively attractive, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, Dogecoin lacks significant news or technical signals to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the bearish market sentiment and current macroeconomic uncertainties, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT as a stable asset is prudent."
2025-02-02 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as trade tensions and new tariffs that have led to a broader market sell-off. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, dropping significantly below $95K, reflecting heightened investor anxiety. Ethereum has also experienced a notable decline, falling by approximately 5.6%. Despite the downturn, Solana has shown some resilience with bullish momentum signals, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its price. Tether, as a stablecoin, continues to provide a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Given the recent price drop below $95K and negative news sentiment, Bitcoin appears less attractive in the current environment. The bearish macroeconomic context further supports a cautious stance.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum's recent decline and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach. However, the presence of existing holdings warrants a less aggressive reduction.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite the overall market downturn, Solana exhibits bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity, making it relatively more attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral. The current holdings do not necessitate a change in exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining or slightly increasing exposure to USDT as a stable asset is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2025-02-02 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility and uncertainty, with the U.S. dollar index at a high level and the S&P 500 showing strength. However, the crypto market is experiencing a downturn, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as trade tensions and new tariffs affecting market sentiment. Bitcoin has been particularly impacted, with recent news highlighting a significant drop due to these factors. Ethereum has also faced a notable decline, while Solana and Dogecoin have shown some resilience with positive momentum signals, although no significant news has been reported for them. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT might be seen as a safe haven due to their stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some recovery in price, Bitcoin is under pressure from macroeconomic news and lacks bullish technical signals. Without current holdings, no reduction is possible, but caution is advised.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's recent drop aligns with the broader market downturn, yet it shows some bullish momentum. Given the mixed signals, a neutral stance is appropriate.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana displays bullish momentum and a stable price range, suggesting a potential opportunity for capital allocation amid a lack of negative news.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators, warranting a hold position given current holdings.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of market volatility and risk aversion, maintaining or slightly increasing USDT exposure is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, reaching a three-week low, while Ethereum has also seen a notable decline. Despite the lack of significant news for Solana and Dogecoin, their prices have also decreased, indicating a general market downturn. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices, suggest a risk-off environment, which typically favors stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop and negative news, Bitcoin's lack of a buy signal and bearish macroeconomic context suggest a neutral stance is appropriate.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum has experienced a significant decline and is below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market conditions.

SOL: +0.2 — Although Solana's price has decreased, it maintains bullish momentum, suggesting some resilience. A slight positive allocation is warranted.

DOGE: -0.4 — Dogecoin has seen a significant price drop and is below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Reducing exposure is advisable.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is a prudent strategy to preserve capital and reduce risk."
2025-02-02 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, dropping below key psychological levels, and Ethereum has similarly been affected by the broader market downturn. Technical indicators for most assets suggest bearish momentum, with prices breaking below lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential further downside. In such a risk-averse environment, stablecoins like USDT become more attractive as investors seek to preserve capital.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop and negative news, BTC remains a key asset with potential for recovery. However, current bearish sentiment and technical indicators suggest holding rather than increasing exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum has faced significant selling pressure, and technical indicators are bearish. Given the current market conditions and our existing holdings, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana has also been affected by the market downturn, with bearish technical signals. While there is no significant news, the overall sentiment suggests a cautious approach, justifying a slight reduction.

DOGE: -0.5 — Dogecoin is experiencing a strong bearish trend with significant price decreases and no supportive news. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market environment.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market with increased volatility, USDT provides a safe haven. Increasing USDT holdings aligns with a strategy to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-02 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a broad sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, reflecting investor anxiety, while Ethereum has also seen a sharp decline. The technical indicators for most assets are showing bearish signals, with prices falling below key support levels. In this environment, stablecoin USDT remains a safe haven, as evidenced by its stable price amidst the broader market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop and bearish news, Bitcoin's current price level may already reflect the negative sentiment. Holding off on further allocation changes until clearer signals emerge.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant price decline and bearish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure slightly to mitigate risk.

SOL: -0.2 — Price breakdown and lack of significant news warrant a cautious approach, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.4 — Significant price decrease and bearish technicals indicate a stronger case for reducing exposure to manage downside risk.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-02 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a bearish sentiment, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as trade tensions and rising tariffs, which have led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin dropping below key psychological levels due to trade war jitters. Despite a slight recovery in the last hour, the overall trend remains negative. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen significant price decreases, although they lack specific news catalysts. The macroeconomic backdrop, with a high U.S. dollar index and stable gold prices, suggests a risk-off environment, making USDT an attractive safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent declines, the slight recovery in the last hour and normal on-chain activity suggest a cautious approach to re-entering BTC positions. However, the broader bearish sentiment limits a stronger buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued downward pressure and significant price drop amid broader market decline warrant reducing exposure. The lack of positive momentum signals further supports this stance.

SOL: +0.1 — While SOL has experienced a significant decrease, the lack of negative news and a recent price uptick suggest a potential for stabilization. However, overall market conditions advise caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, DOGE lacks significant news or technical indicators to justify a change in allocation. The market sentiment remains neutral.

USDT: +0.5 — In a risk-off environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent. The stablecoin provides a safe haven amid market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainties."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have negatively impacted investor confidence. Bitcoin has experienced significant downward pressure, dropping to a three-week low, while Ethereum has also seen a notable decline. Despite some short-term price recoveries in the past few hours, the technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies remain weak, with no clear buy signals. The broader market downturn has led to increased volatility, and there is a cautious sentiment among investors, with a preference for stability in the face of uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Given the recent significant price drop and negative news sentiment, reducing exposure to BTC is prudent. The lack of bullish technical indicators further supports this decision.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is also experiencing downward pressure, with no positive technical signals to suggest a reversal. The broader market decline and recent sell-off justify a cautious stance.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana has seen some price recovery, there is no significant news or technical indicators to suggest a strong buy signal. Maintaining a neutral position is advisable.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, DOGE remains a neutral asset in the current market environment.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital and mitigate risk."
2025-02-02 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as rising U.S. tariffs and trade tensions, which have negatively impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Bitcoin has been particularly affected, experiencing a significant drop below $95K, while Ethereum has also seen a notable decline. Technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE are showing bearish signals, with prices generally below key moving averages and momentum indicators. Despite these pressures, USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during periods of heightened market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent price drop below $95K amid trade tensions and bearish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.4 — Significant price decline and bearish momentum signal a cautious approach, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the bearish market, SOL has no significant news or technical signals to justify a change in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no major news or significant technical changes, maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.9 — In light of bearish market conditions and increased volatility, a higher allocation to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and reduce risk exposure."
2025-02-02 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, with the CBOE Volatility Index at 17.89, indicating increased market uncertainty. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong at 108.78, which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Recent news highlights a significant market downturn, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing notable declines amid escalating trade tensions and new tariffs. Bitcoin's price has been volatile, with a recent drop below $95K due to global trade-war jitters. Ethereum has also faced a sharp decline, falling approximately 5.6%. Despite these challenges, Solana and Dogecoin have not been significantly impacted by news, and Tether remains stable as expected for a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent news and price volatility suggest a bearish outlook for Bitcoin. The lack of positive technical signals and the impact of trade tensions warrant a cautious approach, reducing exposure.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's significant price drop and bearish technical indicators, coupled with negative market sentiment, suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Solana remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to adjust the current allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows no significant changes in market data or sentiment. Maintaining a neutral position is prudent given the lack of directional signals.

USDT: +0.9 — In light of the bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-02 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as escalating trade tensions and new U.S. tariffs, which have led to a sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced significant downward pressure, dropping to a three-week low, and Ethereum has also declined notably. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE show no buy signals, with momentum remaining weak. In contrast, USDT shows some bullish momentum, reflecting a flight to safety as investors seek stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The macroeconomic environment and recent news suggest continued downward pressure. With no bullish technical signals, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum has been hit hard by the market downturn, with significant price declines and no positive momentum indicators, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the overall bearish sentiment, SOL has shown relative price stability with no significant news impact. Maintaining current exposure is appropriate.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE's recent price increase lacks strong supporting signals, and with no significant news, a neutral stance is justified.

USDT: +0.8 — Given the bearish market conditions and flight to safety, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns, particularly the U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price declines, exacerbated by technical downtrends and high liquidation volumes. The macroeconomic context, including high interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, further pressures risk assets. In such an environment, stablecoins like USDT are likely to see increased demand as investors seek safety amid heightened volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is under pressure from macroeconomic events and local market conditions, such as the Korean ""kimchi premium,"" suggesting a cautious approach to holding BTC.

ETH: -0.7 — Ethereum is leading in liquidations and is in a pronounced technical downtrend, making it less attractive in the current environment.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana is experiencing significant declines amid the broader market rout, though not as severely as Ethereum, warranting a moderate reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.4 — Dogecoin's significant drop in price and inclusion in the broader market crash suggest reducing exposure, although its volatility is somewhat expected.

USDT: +0.9 — With the current bearish sentiment and market volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."
2025-02-03 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven largely by macroeconomic factors such as the U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a significant sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced sharp declines, with Ethereum leading in liquidations. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea indicates localized bearish sentiment for Bitcoin, while Ethereum's technical downtrend suggests further potential downside. Solana and Dogecoin have also been heavily impacted by the global sell-off, particularly in Asian markets. In contrast, Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during times of market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the recent price drop and bearish news, Bitcoin's long-term fundamentals remain strong. However, the current macroeconomic environment and local bearish sentiment in Korea suggest caution.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum is facing a deeper technical downtrend and significant liquidations, indicating vulnerability in the current market conditions. A cautious approach is warranted.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana has been heavily impacted by the global sell-off, with significant price declines and bearish sentiment. The lack of positive technical signals suggests reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin has also been affected by the sell-off, with no positive technical indicators to support a bullish stance. Reducing exposure is advisable given the current market environment.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in Tether provides a stable base and reduces risk exposure."
2025-02-03 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as new U.S. tariffs, which have triggered a significant global sell-off. This has led to sharp declines across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing notable price drops and increased volatility. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea indicates localized bearish sentiment for Bitcoin, while Ethereum has seen substantial liquidations, underscoring its vulnerability. Solana and Dogecoin have also been affected by the broader market rout, particularly in Asian markets. In contrast, Tether (USDT), as a stablecoin, has shown resilience with bullish momentum, indicating a flight to safety amidst market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.4 — The bearish macroeconomic environment and the recent price drop suggest reducing exposure, especially given the heightened sensitivity to global events.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's significant price decline and high liquidation levels indicate a strong bearish trend, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Despite a slight recent price increase, Solana's involvement in the broader market sell-off and technical breakdown suggests caution.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's recent declines and its inclusion in the broader market crash indicate a need to reduce exposure, albeit less aggressively than other assets.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent as it provides stability and safety amidst volatility."
2025-02-03 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as new U.S. tariffs, which have triggered a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced substantial declines, with Ethereum leading in liquidations. The market is showing signs of heightened volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic events, as evidenced by the recent price fluctuations and technical breakdowns. In contrast, Tether (USDT) is showing bullish momentum, likely due to investors seeking safety amid the market turmoil.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is experiencing significant price declines and bearish technical indicators. The macroeconomic environment and recent news suggest continued pressure, warranting a reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.7 — Ethereum has been hit hard by liquidations and a pronounced downtrend. The technical and macroeconomic signals are negative, suggesting further downside risk.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana has seen a sharp drop amid the broader market sell-off. While there was a recent price increase, the overall sentiment remains negative, indicating caution.

DOGE: -0.4 — Dogecoin has also suffered from the market downturn and lacks positive technical signals. The bearish sentiment suggests reducing exposure.

USDT: +0.9 — Tether is benefiting from increased demand as a safe haven in the current volatile market environment. Its stability and bullish momentum make it an attractive asset to hold."
2025-02-03 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven primarily by macroeconomic concerns such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a significant global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced substantial price declines, with Ethereum leading in liquidations. The market is characterized by heightened volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic events, as evidenced by the sharp price movements and increased transaction activity. In contrast, Tether (USDT) has shown stability and bullish momentum, reflecting a flight to safety as investors seek refuge in stablecoins during turbulent times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some recovery in transaction activity, BTC remains under pressure from macroeconomic factors and technical breakdown signals.

ETH: -0.7 — Ethereum is facing significant downward pressure with high liquidation volumes and a pronounced downtrend, making it less attractive in the current environment.

SOL: -0.6 — Solana's sharp declines amid broader market sell-offs and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.4 — Dogecoin is also caught in the market downturn, with no positive catalysts to warrant holding or increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.8 — Given the bearish market conditions, USDT's stability and bullish momentum make it the preferred asset for capital preservation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price volatility and declines, reflecting heightened sensitivity to these macroeconomic events. Despite some recent price recoveries, the technical indicators for these assets remain largely negative, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals not showing bullish momentum. In contrast, Tether (USDT) has shown strength as a safe haven, with technical indicators suggesting a bullish momentum, likely due to increased demand for stability amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight price recovery, Bitcoin remains under pressure from macroeconomic events, with technical indicators not supporting a bullish outlook. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum has been at the forefront of recent liquidations and is in a pronounced downtrend. The asset's vulnerability to macro sell-offs suggests further reduction in exposure is prudent.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana has seen significant drops amid the broader market rout, and technical indicators do not support a recovery. A cautious reduction in exposure is advised.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin has experienced similar declines to other major assets, but its recent price increase suggests some resilience. However, given the overall bearish sentiment, a slight reduction is warranted.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish environment, USDT remains a preferred asset due to its stability and positive technical indicators, suggesting continued demand as a safe haven. Increasing exposure is advisable."
2025-02-03 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic tensions such as the U.S. tariff announcements, which have caused a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced sharp declines, with Ethereum and Solana being particularly hard hit. The recent news highlights the vulnerability of these assets to macroeconomic events, with Ethereum leading in liquidations and Solana experiencing a significant drop in the Asian markets. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status, indicating a potential flight to safety as investors seek to minimize risk exposure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight recovery, Bitcoin remains sensitive to macroeconomic events, and the recent news suggests continued bearish sentiment. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current volatility.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum is experiencing a deeper technical downtrend and has been at the forefront of liquidations. The negative sentiment and technical indicators suggest further downside risk.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana has been significantly affected by the broader market rout, with a notable drop in the Asian session. The lack of positive momentum and bearish news warrants a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin has also been impacted by the market sell-off, though to a lesser extent than Ethereum and Solana. The bearish sentiment and lack of strong recovery signals suggest caution.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is advisable as it offers stability and a safe haven amid market volatility. The lack of negative news further supports this allocation."
2025-02-03 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. This has led to significant price declines and volatility, particularly for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. The news highlights the heightened sensitivity of these assets to macroeconomic events, with Ethereum and Solana experiencing notable liquidations and price drops. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable, benefiting from its role as a safe haven during periods of market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent price rebound, Bitcoin remains under pressure from macroeconomic events and local bearish conditions in Korea. The lack of strong buy signals and recent volatility suggest caution.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's vulnerability to macro sell-offs and its recent technical downtrend indicate a need to reduce exposure, especially given the significant liquidations and price declines.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp drop amid global market fears and its inclusion in the broader Asian market crash suggest a cautious approach, despite some recent price recovery.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's recent price increase is overshadowed by its inclusion in the broader market crash, indicating continued risk and volatility.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of the current bearish market conditions and heightened volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-03 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight rebound, BTC remains under pressure from macroeconomic factors and technical indicators do not support a buy signal. Given the small holding, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is experiencing a deeper technical downtrend and was heavily impacted by recent liquidations. Current market conditions suggest reducing exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana has been part of the broader market rout and shows no strong technical support. Given the significant holding, a cautious reduction is advised.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's recent drop amid tariff fears and lack of strong technical signals suggests a slight reduction in exposure is warranted.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is advisable as it offers stability and a safe haven for capital preservation."

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and bearish sentiment, largely driven by macroeconomic factors such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements. This has led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin experiencing notable declines. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and the large-scale liquidations in Ethereum highlight the market's sensitivity to global economic developments. Despite these challenges, some assets like Solana and Dogecoin show signs of bullish momentum in technical indicators, albeit within a broader downtrend. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic environment and significant sell-off news suggest caution. The ""kimchi premium"" indicates bearish sentiment in key markets.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is under significant pressure from recent liquidations and a pronounced technical downtrend, making it less attractive in the current environment.

SOL: 0.0 — Although Solana shows bullish momentum, the broader market sell-off and recent price declines warrant a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum, Dogecoin's recent volatility and inclusion in the broader market crash suggest maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.7 — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, increasing exposure to USDT provides a stable hedge against further declines in risk assets."
2025-02-03 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as new U.S. tariffs, which have triggered a global sell-off. This has resulted in significant price drops across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. The Korean ""kimchi premium"" and a substantial liquidation wave further emphasize the market's vulnerability to macroeconomic events. Despite some recent price rebounds, the broader trend remains negative, with heightened volatility and risk aversion among investors. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are likely to see increased demand as investors seek safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price rebounds, the overall sentiment remains bearish due to macroeconomic pressures and the lack of strong buy signals. Maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the current volatility.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's significant recent price drop and its role in major liquidations suggest caution. The technical downtrend and macro vulnerability warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's price has been volatile, with recent sharp declines amid tariff fears. Although there is some bullish momentum, the broader market conditions suggest a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, but the lack of a clear directional trend and mixed news sentiment justify a neutral position.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current risk-averse environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable. The lack of significant news and the stable price support this allocation."
2025-02-03 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as new U.S. tariffs, which have triggered a global sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price declines, with Ethereum and Solana particularly affected due to their high volatility and recent technical downtrends. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and massive liquidations further underscore the market's heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic events. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status, making it a potential safe haven amid the current volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the bearish macroeconomic news, Bitcoin's on-chain activity shows a surge, indicating potential interest. However, the overall market sentiment remains cautious.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's recent significant price drop and vulnerability to macroeconomic sell-offs suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline amid tariff fears and its inclusion in the broader Asian market crash indicate a need to reduce exposure, despite some bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's significant drop aligns with broader market trends, but without strong directional signals, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT as a stable asset provides a hedge against volatility and preserves capital."
2025-02-03 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by macroeconomic tensions, notably the U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price declines, exacerbated by heightened volatility and liquidation events. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and the broader market rout highlight the sensitivity of these assets to macroeconomic developments. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during periods of market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish momentum signals, Bitcoin's sensitivity to macroeconomic events and recent price declines suggest caution. The ""kimchi premium"" indicates local bearish sentiment, warranting a reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.7 — Ethereum is experiencing a pronounced downtrend with significant liquidations, making it vulnerable to further declines. The recent 38% plunge underscores the need to reduce exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana has been part of the broader market sell-off, with significant price drops in the Asian session. Despite some bullish momentum, the overall bearish sentiment suggests a cautious approach.

DOGE: -0.4 — Dogecoin has mirrored the broader market decline, with significant losses amid tariff fears. The lack of strong recovery signals warrants a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.9 — In the current bearish environment, USDT serves as a safe haven. The stability of USDT and the need for capital preservation justify increasing exposure to this stablecoin."
2025-02-03 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, heavily influenced by macroeconomic developments such as the U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price declines, reflecting heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic events. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and the substantial liquidations in Ethereum highlight regional and asset-specific vulnerabilities. Despite the bearish sentiment, there is some bullish momentum indicated by technical indicators like MACD across several assets, suggesting potential for short-term rebounds. In this environment, USDT remains a safe haven, as evidenced by its stability and lack of significant news, making it an attractive option for capital preservation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic environment and recent news indicate continued pressure on BTC. The ""kimchi premium"" suggests regional bearishness, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum's significant involvement in recent liquidations and its technical downtrend suggest further downside risk. The macro sell-off exacerbates this vulnerability, justifying a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp drop amid tariff fears and its inclusion in the broader Asian market crash indicate heightened risk. Despite bullish momentum, the overall sentiment remains negative.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's decline in line with broader market trends and its inclusion in the Asian market crash suggest continued pressure. However, the impact is less severe compared to ETH and SOL.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent for capital preservation. Its stability amidst volatility makes it a preferred asset for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off. This has led to significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, with each experiencing substantial volatility. Despite a recent rebound in prices, the market remains sensitive to macroeconomic developments, as evidenced by the heightened volatility and liquidation events. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are seeing increased demand as investors seek safety amid the uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent sell-off and macroeconomic sensitivity, Bitcoin shows signs of recovery with bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a cautious buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum has been hit hard by liquidations and a technical downtrend, but its recent price increase suggests some recovery potential. However, the overall sentiment remains mixed.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's significant price drop amid the broader market rout and its inclusion in the Asian market crash indicate a need to reduce exposure, especially given current holdings.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's volatility and inclusion in the broader market crash suggest a cautious approach, but recent price increases provide some stability, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased demand for safety, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent, as it provides stability and liquidity in uncertain times."
2025-02-03 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently experiencing heightened volatility due to macroeconomic pressures, particularly the recent U.S. tariff announcements that have triggered a global sell-off. This has led to significant price fluctuations across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin all experiencing sharp declines followed by some recovery. The news highlights the sensitivity of these assets to macroeconomic events, with Ethereum and Solana showing pronounced vulnerability. Despite the recent turmoil, technical indicators suggest some recovery potential, particularly for Bitcoin and Solana, which have shown signs of upward momentum in the latest data.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and a potential breakout above the Bollinger Bands. The rebound from the tariff-driven sell-off suggests resilience, making it relatively attractive.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum has experienced significant liquidations and a steep downtrend, indicating vulnerability. While there is some bullish momentum, the broader technical downtrend warrants a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana has shown a strong recovery with a buy signal in the latest data. Despite recent sell-offs, its upward momentum and volume increase make it moderately attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin has mirrored broader market movements with significant volatility but lacks a clear directional signal. The recent recovery is offset by its earlier steep decline.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent for stability, despite the slight preference for risk assets."
2025-02-03 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently mixed, with recent macroeconomic developments, such as the U.S. tariff announcements, causing significant volatility and sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience with some recovery in prices, but they remain sensitive to macroeconomic events. Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced sharp declines, particularly in the Asian markets, reflecting heightened risk aversion. Despite the sell-offs, technical indicators for most assets show bullish momentum, suggesting potential for recovery. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven during market turbulence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility due to macroeconomic events, BTC shows strong bullish momentum and a potential breakout, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's recent sharp decline and vulnerability to macro sell-offs suggest caution. While momentum is bullish, the lack of a clear trend signal warrants a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's technical indicators are positive, and it has shown strong momentum despite recent sell-offs, suggesting potential for recovery and moderate capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE has shown bullish momentum, its recent significant drop and sensitivity to market sell-offs suggest maintaining a neutral position until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: -0.3 — With the potential for recovery in other assets and bullish momentum across the board, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on risk assets."
2025-02-03 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and a bearish sentiment driven by macroeconomic factors, particularly the recent U.S. tariff announcements. This has led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin experiencing substantial price declines. Despite some recovery in the last few hours, the overall sentiment remains cautious, with investors reacting to global economic uncertainties. Tether (USDT) remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid the market turbulence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin shows signs of recovery with bullish momentum indicators and increased on-chain activity. Its role as a market leader and potential for rebound supports a moderate positive allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing significant technical downtrends and was heavily impacted by recent liquidations. Although momentum remains bullish, the broader market sentiment and recent price action warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana has been part of the broader market sell-off and shows vulnerability to macroeconomic pressures. Given current holdings, reducing exposure slightly is prudent to manage risk.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin has also been affected by the market downturn and shows no strong recovery signals. A slight reduction in exposure is recommended to mitigate potential losses.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for flexibility in future reallocation as market conditions evolve."
2025-02-03 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic developments, particularly the recent U.S. tariff announcements. This has led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin experiencing notable declines. Despite this, there has been a rebound in prices, suggesting some resilience and potential for recovery. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with significant on-chain activity, while Ethereum and Solana are recovering from deeper technical downtrends. Dogecoin, while also affected by the sell-off, shows signs of stabilization. Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent macro-driven sell-offs, Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum and significant on-chain activity, indicating potential for recovery and growth.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is vulnerable to macroeconomic pressures and recent liquidations, with mixed technical signals. It's prudent to hold until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana is recovering from a sharp drop, with positive technical indicators and volume suggesting a potential rebound, albeit with caution due to recent volatility.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's recent volatility and lack of significant positive signals suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing risk.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT provides a buffer against potential further downturns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a rebound in cryptocurrency prices following a sharp sell-off triggered by U.S. tariff announcements. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin experienced significant price drops due to macroeconomic pressures, but recent data indicates a recovery with strong upward momentum and potential breakouts. On-chain activity and technical indicators suggest a bullish sentiment, although the market remains sensitive to macroeconomic developments. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Despite recent macroeconomic pressures, Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and on-chain activity, suggesting a continued recovery and potential breakout.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is recovering from a recent downtrend, with bullish momentum and technical indicators supporting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is showing significant price increases and bullish momentum, indicating a favorable environment for further gains.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin has rebounded strongly with significant price increases and bullish technical indicators, warranting a cautious buy signal.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the recovery in risk assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is justified to capitalize on the bullish momentum in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-02-03 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic events, particularly the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced substantial price declines, reflecting broader market fears and a shift towards risk aversion. Despite some recent price rebounds, the overall sentiment remains cautious, with investors wary of further macroeconomic disruptions. In contrast, Tether (USDT) remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid the turbulence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent sell-offs, BTC shows signs of recovery with strong on-chain activity and technical indicators suggesting potential for upward movement. However, macroeconomic concerns temper enthusiasm.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is experiencing significant downward pressure and high liquidation volumes, making it less attractive in the current risk-averse environment.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's recent price drop and vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks suggest caution, though technical indicators remain somewhat supportive.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin's recent volatility and susceptibility to broader market declines warrant a cautious stance, despite some technical buy signals.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current risk-off environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-03 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently mixed, with recent macroeconomic developments such as the U.S. tariff announcements causing significant volatility across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable sell-offs, driven by macroeconomic fears and technical downtrends, while Solana and Dogecoin have also been affected by broader market declines. Despite this, recent market data indicates a recovery in prices with bullish momentum signals across most assets. However, the heightened volatility and recent news suggest caution, especially given the sensitivity of these assets to macroeconomic events. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven during market turbulence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility due to macroeconomic events, BTC shows signs of recovery with bullish momentum and strong on-chain activity. However, caution is warranted due to potential macroeconomic risks.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum's recent sharp decline and vulnerability to macro sell-offs suggest caution. While there is some recovery, the broader downtrend and liquidation concerns weigh on its outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana has shown resilience with positive price movements and bullish momentum signals. However, recent news of significant drops in Asian markets suggests potential risks.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin has experienced significant volatility, but current technical indicators are neutral. The lack of strong directional signals suggests a hold position.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the recent market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainties, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a hedge against potential downside risks in other assets."
2025-02-03 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic factors such as the recent U.S. tariff announcements, which have triggered a global sell-off across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all experienced significant price declines, reflecting heightened sensitivity to these macroeconomic events. Despite the recent rebound in prices, the news highlights the vulnerability of these assets to broader market conditions. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status as a safe haven during volatile periods.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price increases and bullish technical indicators, the macroeconomic news and the ""kimchi premium"" signal potential bearish conditions, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's vulnerability to macro sell-offs and its recent technical downtrend suggest reducing exposure, despite some bullish momentum in the short term.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's recent price drop and its inclusion in the broader market crash indicate a need to be cautious, even though technical indicators show some bullish signals.

DOGE: -0.1 — Although Dogecoin has shown some price recovery, the recent market crash and its inclusion in the broader sell-off suggest maintaining a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current bearish market sentiment and volatility, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT as a stable asset is prudent to hedge against further market declines."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns, particularly the impact of new U.S. tariffs leading to a global sell-off. This has significantly affected major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin experiencing notable declines. Despite some technical indicators showing bullish momentum, the broader macroeconomic environment and recent news highlight heightened volatility and risk aversion among investors. The ""kimchi premium"" in Korea and massive liquidations in Ethereum further underscore the market's sensitivity to global economic developments. In this context, Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid the turmoil.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical signals, the macroeconomic environment and recent sell-off news suggest caution. The ""kimchi premium"" indicates local bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.5 — Ethereum is particularly vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks, as evidenced by significant liquidations and a steep downtrend. Reducing exposure is prudent.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's price has been hit hard by the global sell-off, and the news of its sharp decline in Asian markets suggests continued risk. Reducing exposure is advisable.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's decline in line with broader market trends and its inclusion in the Asian market crash suggest maintaining a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current risk-averse environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is wise to preserve capital and manage volatility."
2025-02-04 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Despite recent regulatory concerns, BTC has shown resilience, rebounding close to $100K. ETH is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation and confidence in the asset. SOL has seen institutional interest, which has bolstered its price recovery above key support levels. DOGE remains relatively stable with some strategic acquisitions, while USDT faces scrutiny over reserve transparency, which could impact its perceived stability. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a strong dollar, suggests a mixed backdrop for risk assets, but the crypto market's internal dynamics appear to be driving a positive trend.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite regulatory concerns, BTC's strong rebound and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum. The easing of trade-war fears further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate accumulation, and the high ETF trading volumes suggest strong institutional interest, supporting a bullish stance.

SOL: +0.7 — Institutional accumulation and a strong price recovery above support levels highlight SOL's attractiveness, with potential for further gains as it approaches resistance.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there are strategic acquisitions, the overall market activity and sentiment remain stable, providing no strong directional signal.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and scrutiny over reserve transparency, there may be a slight rotation out of USDT into more volatile assets."
2025-02-04 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators and recovering from recent dips. Bitcoin is experiencing a rebound after easing trade-war concerns, while Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation. Solana has shown resilience, bouncing back from recent lows, supported by institutional interest. Dogecoin's sentiment is bolstered by strategic acquisitions and government interest, while Tether remains stable amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is showing bullish momentum with easing trade-war fears and a rebound in price. The technical indicators are positive, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and strong ETF volumes indicate institutional interest, warranting a higher allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Institutional buying and a strong price rebound above key support levels highlight positive sentiment and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Strategic acquisitions and government interest provide a positive outlook, though overall market activity remains moderate.

USDT: -0.4 — With improving market conditions and increased risk appetite, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to allocate more towards growth assets."
2025-02-04 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a general recovery in prices following recent regulatory and trade-war concerns. Bitcoin is showing resilience, rebounding towards $100K after a dip below $97K due to regulatory news, indicating a potential stabilization in the market. Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, suggesting a potential bullish sentiment as investors might be moving ETH to private wallets for long-term holding. Solana has seen a notable investment from Sol Strategies, indicating institutional interest and confidence in its future growth. Dogecoin's recent acquisition by Neptune Digital Assets and government-related news suggest a mixed sentiment, with some speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether's stability is under scrutiny due to regulatory discussions, but it remains a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, Bitcoin's recovery towards $100K and bullish technical indicators suggest a positive outlook. The easing of trade-war fears further supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — The significant outflow of ETH from exchanges and record ETF volumes indicate strong underlying demand, warranting a positive allocation despite recent price volatility.

SOL: +0.7 — Institutional investment and a rebound above key support levels highlight strong buying interest, making Solana an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals from recent news and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance. While there is speculative interest, the lack of strong technical or fundamental drivers keeps the allocation neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of recovery and risk appetite increasing, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-02-04 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a general recovery in crypto prices following easing trade-war concerns. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards $100K after a regulatory-induced dip. Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation despite recent price weakness. Solana has seen strategic accumulation by institutional players, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. Dogecoin is witnessing strategic purchases and government-backed initiatives, which could bolster its appeal. Meanwhile, Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency but remains stable, with potential regulatory changes on the horizon.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Bitcoin's recovery towards $100K and bullish momentum signals suggest a moderate buy opportunity, despite regulatory concerns. The overall market sentiment is improving, supporting BTC's potential for further gains.

**ETH: +0.3** — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate accumulation and potential upward pressure. However, recent price volatility and mixed news warrant a cautious approach.

**SOL: +0.6** — Institutional accumulation and a strong price rebound above key support levels highlight Solana's relative strength and attractiveness in the current market environment.

**DOGE: +0.2** — Strategic acquisitions and government-backed initiatives provide a slight positive bias, though overall activity remains low, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

**USDT: -0.3** — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected. The potential regulatory impact on stablecoins also suggests a slight reduction in exposure."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a recent recovery in prices across major cryptocurrencies following a period of regulatory and trade-war-induced volatility. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards $100,000 after dipping below $97,000 due to regulatory concerns. Ethereum has experienced significant outflows from exchanges, suggesting potential accumulation despite recent price weakness. Solana has seen institutional interest, with a notable investment by Sol Strategies, indicating confidence in its potential. Dogecoin's strategic acquisition by Neptune Digital Assets and government interest in DOGE-backed initiatives highlight its unique position in the market. Meanwhile, Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency, but the introduction of a stablecoin bill could provide regulatory clarity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, Bitcoin's price recovery and strong technical indicators suggest a positive outlook. The easing of trade-war fears further supports a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.3 — The significant outflow from exchanges indicates potential accumulation, and the record ETF volumes suggest increased institutional interest, warranting a moderately positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional investment and a strong price rebound above key support levels indicate robust demand, making Solana an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some positive news around strategic acquisitions and government interest, the technical indicators remain mixed, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of recovery and risk appetite increasing, there is a rationale for reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2025-02-04 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop, with moderate volatility in the S&P 500 and a strong U.S. Dollar Index. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards $100K after a dip related to regulatory concerns, indicating a potential recovery. Ethereum is seeing significant outflows from exchanges, which could signal a bullish sentiment as investors move ETH to private wallets, despite recent price weakness. Solana's price recovery and strategic accumulation by institutional investors suggest strong buying interest. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with strategic acquisitions by investment firms, but lacks strong momentum. Tether remains stable, with ongoing regulatory scrutiny potentially impacting future sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, BTC is showing signs of recovery with strong on-chain activity and a rebound in price. The easing of trade-war fears also supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — The substantial outflow from exchanges suggests a bullish sentiment, as investors may be moving ETH to hold long-term. However, recent price weakness tempers the score slightly.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional accumulation and a strong price rebound indicate robust buying interest. SOL's technical indicators remain positive, supporting a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there are strategic acquisitions, DOGE lacks strong momentum and has experienced significant recent price decreases. The sentiment remains neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With signs of recovery in the broader crypto market, there is potential for capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT as risk appetite increases."
2025-02-04 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of cautious optimism and regulatory concerns. Bitcoin has experienced volatility due to regulatory news but is showing signs of recovery as trade-war fears ease. Ethereum is witnessing significant outflows from exchanges, suggesting potential accumulation and a positive sentiment shift despite recent price weakness. Solana has seen institutional interest with significant purchases, indicating confidence in its long-term prospects. Dogecoin has been buoyed by strategic acquisitions and government-backed initiatives, although its price remains volatile. Tether faces scrutiny over its reserve transparency, but the introduction of a stablecoin bill could provide regulatory clarity, affecting its future dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite regulatory concerns, Bitcoin's recovery towards $100K and positive momentum signals suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges indicate potential accumulation, and the recent price rebound supports a slightly positive stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a strong price rebound above key support levels highlight Solana's relative strength and attractiveness.

DOGE: +0.2 — Strategic acquisitions and government initiatives provide a positive backdrop, but price volatility warrants a moderate score.

USDT: -0.4 — With improving risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, maintaining high USDT exposure is less attractive."
2025-02-04 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent volatility driven by macroeconomic factors such as trade-war concerns and regulatory developments. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards $100K after a dip below $97K, influenced by easing trade-war fears. Ethereum has experienced significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or strategic repositioning amid a turbulent market environment. Solana has seen strategic buying interest from institutional players, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. Dogecoin's recent acquisition by Neptune Digital Assets indicates some strategic interest, although its price remains volatile. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability and market perception.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, Bitcoin's rebound and strong on-chain activity suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook. The easing trade-war fears provide additional support.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges and high ETF trading volumes indicate potential accumulation and strategic interest, despite recent price weakness.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional buying and a strong rebound from support levels highlight positive sentiment and potential for further gains, making it relatively attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite strategic acquisitions, the lack of strong momentum signals and mixed news sentiment suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With easing trade-war fears and strategic interest in other assets, there is a potential shift away from stablecoins, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2025-02-04 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some signs of recovery following recent regulatory and trade-war concerns. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark again after a brief dip, driven by easing trade-war fears. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or strategic repositioning by investors, despite recent price weakness. Solana is showing resilience, with institutional interest from firms like Sol Strategies boosting confidence. Dogecoin is experiencing increased attention from both investment firms and government initiatives, though its price remains volatile. Tether remains stable amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny, with new legislative developments potentially impacting its future.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with easing trade-war fears and nearing a significant psychological level of $100K. However, regulatory concerns still linger, warranting a cautious but positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — The large outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and despite recent price weakness, the potential for a rebound is strong, supported by record ETF volumes.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and a recent price rebound above $200 indicate positive momentum. However, resistance around $210–220 suggests a measured approach.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased institutional and governmental interest is a positive sign, but the price remains volatile, suggesting a cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite regulatory scrutiny, USDT remains stable. Given the mixed market conditions, maintaining current exposure to stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2025-02-04 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with signs of recovery in major cryptocurrencies following recent regulatory and trade-war concerns. Bitcoin is showing resilience, rebounding towards $100K after a brief dip due to regulatory news. Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or strategic repositioning by investors. Solana has seen a notable investment from Sol Strategies, boosting confidence in its price recovery. Dogecoin is witnessing strategic acquisitions, hinting at renewed interest. Meanwhile, Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency, but stablecoin regulation could bring more clarity and stability to the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite regulatory concerns, Bitcoin's price is recovering, and the easing of trade-war fears supports a positive outlook. On-chain activity remains stable, suggesting continued interest.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and the high ETF volumes indicate strong market activity. However, technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and price recovery above key support levels suggest bullish sentiment. The recent investment by Sol Strategies adds confidence.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is strategic acquisition interest, the overall market data and technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there's a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets. However, regulatory scrutiny could impact sentiment."
2025-02-04 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark amid easing trade-war fears, despite recent regulatory concerns. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or reduced selling pressure, alongside record ETF volumes suggesting heightened trading activity. Solana has shown resilience, bouncing back above $200, supported by institutional interest. Dogecoin has experienced strategic acquisitions, though its price remains relatively stable. Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency, but the introduction of a stablecoin bill could provide regulatory clarity, potentially stabilizing its role in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with easing trade-war fears and nearing a psychological $100K level, although regulatory concerns persist.

ETH: +0.6 — Significant outflows from exchanges and record ETF volumes suggest strong accumulation and potential for upward movement.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and a recovery above $200 indicate a positive outlook, though resistance remains at higher levels.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite strategic acquisitions, there is no significant change in price action or sentiment to warrant a directional move.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, there is a slight preference to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with signs of recovery across several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has rebounded close to $100K after easing trade-war fears, despite recent regulatory concerns. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation, and record ETF volumes suggest increased institutional interest. Solana has shown resilience, bouncing back above $200, supported by strategic acquisitions from investment firms. Dogecoin has experienced notable purchases, hinting at speculative interest, while Tether remains stable amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny. The macroeconomic context, with stable oil prices and a moderate VIX, suggests a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, Bitcoin's price recovery and proximity to the $100K mark indicate a positive outlook. The easing of trade-war fears further supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Significant outflows from exchanges and high ETF volumes suggest strong institutional interest and potential for upward momentum, warranting a favorable allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — The strategic acquisition by Sol Strategies and price recovery above $200 indicate growing confidence and potential for further gains, justifying a positive score.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent acquisitions and government interest provide a speculative boost, though the overall market environment remains cautious, leading to a modest positive signal.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the stable macroeconomic environment and the absence of strong risk-on signals, maintaining current USDT holdings is prudent, with no immediate need for reallocation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark as trade-war fears ease, suggesting a potential recovery in the broader crypto market. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or a shift in investor strategy, while also experiencing high ETF trading volumes. Solana has shown resilience with a price rebound and strategic accumulation by investment firms, highlighting growing institutional interest. Dogecoin's market activity is buoyed by strategic acquisitions and government-backed initiatives, though its price remains volatile. Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency, but remains stable amid regulatory developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's price is nearing a psychological milestone of $100K, supported by easing trade-war concerns. Despite regulatory challenges, the overall sentiment is improving, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant outflows from exchanges and high ETF trading volumes indicate potential accumulation and increased investor interest, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional accumulation and a strong price rebound above key support levels highlight positive sentiment and potential for further gains, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite strategic acquisitions and government initiatives, Dogecoin's price volatility and lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance for now.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of recovery and increased risk appetite, there's a moderate preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2025-02-04 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with signs of recovery across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has rebounded close to the $100,000 mark after easing trade-war fears, although regulatory concerns linger. Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum, supported by significant outflows from exchanges and record ETF volumes, indicating potential upward pressure. Solana is experiencing renewed interest with strategic acquisitions and price recovery above key support levels. Dogecoin's sentiment remains mixed, with strategic purchases by investment firms but no significant price movement. Tether remains stable amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny, with new legislation potentially impacting its future.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin is showing resilience with a rebound in price and easing trade-war concerns. However, regulatory issues still pose some risk, warranting a moderate positive score.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and significant outflows from exchanges suggest a robust upward trend. The high ETF volumes further support a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strategic acquisitions and price recovery above $200 indicate strong buying interest, with potential for further gains as it approaches resistance levels.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite strategic purchases, Dogecoin lacks significant price movement or momentum changes, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive movements in other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2025-02-04 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with signs of recovery in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH following recent regulatory and trade-war concerns. Bitcoin is showing resilience, rebounding towards $100K after a dip due to regulatory news, while Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation. Solana is gaining attention from institutional investors, suggesting confidence in its growth potential. Dogecoin's market activity is relatively stable, with some strategic acquisitions indicating interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable amidst ongoing regulatory scrutiny, with new legislative developments potentially impacting its future.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite regulatory concerns, BTC is showing resilience with a rebound towards $100K. The easing of trade-war fears supports a moderate bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and strong ETF volumes indicate interest. Bullish momentum in technicals further supports a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and a price rebound above key support levels indicate positive sentiment. Bullish momentum in recent hours justifies a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some strategic acquisition, overall market activity and sentiment remain stable without strong bullish indicators.

USDT: -0.3 — As market sentiment improves, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-02-04 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a mix of regulatory concerns and easing trade-war fears influencing asset prices. Bitcoin has experienced volatility due to regulatory discussions but shows signs of recovery as trade-war fears ease. Ethereum is seeing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation, and has strong ETF trading volumes, suggesting increased interest. Solana has shown resilience with institutional interest and a price rebound, while Dogecoin's news is mixed with strategic acquisitions and government interest. Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency, but stablecoin regulation could impact its future stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns, BTC is showing resilience with a recovery towards $100K. On-chain activity is robust, suggesting continued interest.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong bullish momentum with significant outflows from exchanges and high ETF volumes indicate potential upside.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional accumulation and a price rebound above key support levels suggest strong buying interest and potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed news and low on-chain activity provide no clear directional signal. Holding current positions seems prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market, there is a slight preference for reallocating some capital from stablecoins to riskier assets."
2025-02-04 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment across the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced volatility, with recent price fluctuations driven by regulatory concerns and trade-war fears. Despite these challenges, BTC has shown resilience, rebounding towards $100,000. Ethereum is witnessing significant outflows from exchanges, suggesting potential accumulation or reduced selling pressure, while its ETF volumes indicate heightened trading activity. Solana is gaining institutional interest, as evidenced by significant acquisitions, and has shown a strong price recovery. Dogecoin's recent strategic purchases by investment firms suggest a positive outlook, though its price remains relatively stable. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its stability, but it remains a safe haven amid market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.3** — Despite regulatory concerns, BTC's resilience and recovery towards $100,000, coupled with high on-chain activity, suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

**ETH: +0.5** — Strong bullish momentum and significant outflows from exchanges indicate potential upward pressure, supported by high ETF trading volumes.

**SOL: +0.6** — Institutional interest and a robust price recovery above $200 highlight SOL's attractiveness, with bullish technical indicators supporting further gains.

**DOGE: 0.0** — While strategic acquisitions are positive, DOGE's technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a hold position.

**USDT: -0.2** — Regulatory scrutiny and potential capital rotation into riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in USDT holdings, though it remains a stable option in uncertain conditions."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a stable S&P 500 and a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index, suggesting a cautious risk sentiment. Bitcoin has experienced volatility due to regulatory news but shows signs of recovery. Ethereum is seeing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or reduced selling pressure. Solana is gaining interest from institutional investors, which may support its price. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with some strategic acquisitions, while Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its perceived stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, Bitcoin is showing resilience with a near recovery to $100K, suggesting potential for further upside.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges and high ETF volumes indicate accumulation and interest, supporting a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a strong price rebound above key support levels suggest continued upward momentum.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some strategic acquisition, overall sentiment and technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.2 — With increasing interest in risk assets and regulatory scrutiny, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2025-02-04 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some recovery signs in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and SOL, despite recent regulatory concerns and trade-war fears. Bitcoin's price has been volatile, influenced by regulatory news, but it is showing resilience as it approaches the $100K mark again. Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or strategic repositioning by investors, despite recent price weakness. Solana is gaining institutional interest, as evidenced by Sol Strategies' substantial purchase, and its price is rebounding from recent lows. Dogecoin's sentiment remains relatively stable, with minor strategic acquisitions by investment firms. Tether faces regulatory scrutiny, but the stablecoin market remains crucial for liquidity in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite regulatory concerns, BTC is showing resilience with a price rebound and nearing $100K. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation, and strong ETF volumes indicate investor interest, supporting a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and price recovery above key support levels signal strong buying interest, justifying a higher allocation preference.

DOGE: -0.1 — Although there are strategic acquisitions, the lack of strong technical or on-chain signals suggests maintaining current exposure with a slight reduction.

USDT: -0.4 — With improving market sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on market recovery."
2025-02-04 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with some positive developments, particularly in Ethereum and Solana, despite recent volatility. Bitcoin is experiencing fluctuations due to regulatory news and trade-war concerns, while Ethereum sees significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Solana has shown resilience with institutional interest and price recovery, while Dogecoin has seen strategic acquisitions but lacks strong momentum. Tether remains stable amidst regulatory scrutiny, with potential implications from new stablecoin legislation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite nearing $100K, Bitcoin faces regulatory uncertainty and lacks strong technical signals, suggesting a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges and record ETF volumes indicate potential bullish sentiment, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and price recovery above key support levels suggest strong buying interest, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Strategic acquisitions are noted, but the lack of technical momentum and broader market impact keeps the signal neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive developments in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent as risk appetite increases."
2025-02-04 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant dip below $97,000 due to regulatory concerns, but it has shown resilience by rebounding close to $100,000 as trade-war fears ease. Ethereum has seen substantial outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation despite recent price weakness. Solana has demonstrated strong buying interest, with institutional support helping it recover above $200. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, with some strategic acquisitions but no major price movements. Tether is under scrutiny due to regulatory developments, which may impact its perceived stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility and regulatory concerns, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests underlying strength. However, the lack of a clear bullish technical signal warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges and record ETF volumes indicate strong accumulation interest, suggesting potential upside despite recent price declines.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a successful price rebound above key support levels signal strong buying momentum, making Solana an attractive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there are strategic acquisitions, the lack of strong technical or sentiment changes keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.2 — With increased volatility and potential regulatory impacts, maintaining a slightly reduced exposure to USDT is prudent, favoring allocation towards more volatile assets with upside potential."
2025-02-04 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Solana has seen institutional interest with strategic purchases, suggesting confidence in its recovery after testing support levels. Dogecoin has been buoyed by strategic acquisitions and government-backed initiatives, though its price remains volatile. Tether remains stable, but regulatory scrutiny could impact its future dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent regulatory concerns, BTC is showing resilience with a recovery in price and easing trade-war fears. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation and potential for price appreciation, despite recent weakness.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and a recovery above key support levels indicate strong buying interest and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.1 — Strategic acquisitions and government initiatives provide a slight positive sentiment, but volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.2 — With a slight bullish sentiment in the market, there is a modest preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with signs of recovery in major cryptocurrencies following recent declines. Bitcoin is showing resilience as it approaches the $100K mark, driven by easing trade-war concerns, although regulatory discussions continue to weigh on sentiment. Ethereum has experienced significant outflows from exchanges, indicating potential accumulation or strategic repositioning by investors, despite recent price weakness. Solana is attracting institutional interest, with notable purchases by investment firms, suggesting confidence in its long-term prospects. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with some strategic acquisitions, while Tether faces scrutiny over reserve transparency amidst new regulatory developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with positive news about trade-war concerns easing, but regulatory uncertainties still linger. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant outflows from exchanges suggest accumulation and potential bullish sentiment, despite recent price volatility. The high ETF volumes also indicate strong interest.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and recent price recovery above key support levels suggest strong buying interest and potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some strategic acquisitions, there is no significant change in sentiment or technical indicators to warrant a strong directional bias.

USDT: -0.2 — With the market showing signs of recovery, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, although regulatory scrutiny remains a concern."
2025-02-05 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals, with macroeconomic indicators showing moderate stability. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, and the S&P 500 is relatively high, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. However, the volatility index is low, indicating limited market fear. In the crypto space, Bitcoin faces challenges as it struggles to maintain key support levels, despite strong institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, while Solana shows promise with increased activity in DeFi derivatives. Dogecoin remains quiet with no significant news, and Tether is stable, benefiting from the rise in gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price struggles, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest underlying support. However, caution is warranted due to potential support level breaches.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum faces governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors, leading to a cautious stance despite no immediate sell signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in DeFi derivatives and increased trading volume on Solana's platform provide a bullish outlook, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data results in a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed market sentiment and some positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential opportunities in riskier assets."
2025-02-05 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context suggests a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.77. The S&P 500 is at a high level, reflecting a generally optimistic market sentiment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index is relatively strong at 107.58, which could exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is facing mixed signals; while there are significant ETF inflows indicating institutional interest, it struggles with maintaining support in a critical price band. Ethereum is under scrutiny for governance issues, which could affect investor confidence. Solana is experiencing positive developments with the launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform, indicating strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether remains stable, with interest in gold-backed stablecoins rising due to record gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the risk of losing support, strong ETF inflows suggest institutional interest, providing a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors create uncertainty, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in the DeFi space with Raydium's launch suggest increased activity and potential growth, warranting a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals results in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the overall positive sentiment in the market and developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-02-05 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.77. The S&P 500 remains strong, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment in traditional markets. However, the high U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) could indicate potential pressure on crypto assets. Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest with major inflows into spot ETFs, but it faces technical challenges around key support levels. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, which might affect its competitive positioning. Solana is gaining traction in the DeFi space with new derivatives offerings, while Dogecoin lacks significant news. Tether remains stable, but the rise in gold-backed stablecoins highlights a potential shift towards asset-backed tokens amid record gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite technical challenges, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest a positive outlook. The asset remains attractive for capital allocation given its institutional demand.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum faces governance scrutiny and underperformance concerns, making it less attractive compared to other assets. However, its fundamental position in the crypto ecosystem prevents a stronger negative score.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive momentum in the DeFi derivatives space and strong trading volumes make it an attractive asset for capital allocation, reflecting confidence in its growth potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to adjust the current allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — In light of the generally positive market sentiment and opportunities in other crypto assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility (VIX at 15.77) and a strong U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 107.58), suggesting cautious optimism in broader markets. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin facing pressure below its key price band and Ethereum underperforming amid governance concerns. Solana shows promise with strong DeFi derivatives activity, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or momentum. Tether remains stable but is influenced by the rising popularity of gold-backed stablecoins due to record gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs, the asset faces downward pressure below a critical price band, suggesting a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum's underperformance and governance scrutiny create uncertainty, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in DeFi derivatives and strong trading volumes support a favorable outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for further downside in major cryptos, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2025-02-05 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed picture with stable U.S. Treasury yields and a strong U.S. Dollar Index, which may exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500's stability and low volatility index suggest a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest through ETF inflows, yet faces technical resistance at key price levels. Ethereum is under scrutiny for governance issues, while Solana benefits from strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether remains stable amid rising gold prices, indicating a potential safe-haven demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite technical resistance, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest continued demand, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

**ETH: 0.0** — Ethereum faces governance concerns and underperformance, leading to a neutral stance as it struggles to gain momentum.

**SOL: +0.6** — Solana's positive DeFi developments and strong trading volume in new derivatives markets support a favorable outlook.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With no significant news or technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market environment.

**USDT: -0.3** — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for capital rotation into risk assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is suggested."
2025-02-05 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which generally exerts downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest through spot ETFs, yet it faces technical challenges as it struggles to maintain key support levels. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance and competitive positioning, which may hinder its short-term performance. Solana benefits from positive developments in the DeFi space, while Dogecoin lacks significant news to drive momentum. Gold's record prices have bolstered interest in gold-backed stablecoins, indirectly affecting Tether's positioning.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional inflows via ETFs are a positive sign, but technical challenges and macroeconomic headwinds suggest caution. A moderate buy signal reflects this mixed outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite recent bullish momentum, concerns about governance and competitive positioning create uncertainty. Hold current position until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DeFi activity and new product launches provide a positive outlook, suggesting an increase in allocation to capitalize on growth potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest maintaining the current position without changes.

USDT: -0.2 — While macroeconomic conditions favor holding stablecoins, the potential for capital rotation into more promising assets like SOL and BTC suggests a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2025-02-05 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is facing pressure due to its dip below a key support level, despite strong institutional interest as evidenced by significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance issues and underperformance relative to competitors, which could impact its attractiveness. Solana is seeing positive developments with the launch of a new derivatives platform, indicating strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news, suggesting a stable outlook. Meanwhile, Tether's stability is reinforced by the surge in gold-backed stablecoins amid high gold prices, reflecting a flight to safety in uncertain economic conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price pressure, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest underlying demand, warranting a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — Governance concerns and underperformance relative to peers create a slightly negative sentiment, though bullish momentum is still present.

SOL: +0.5 — The launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform and strong trading volumes indicate positive momentum and increased DeFi activity, supporting a favorable allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in stablecoins provides a buffer against market uncertainty."

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context indicates a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as reflected by the VIX index. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a bullish sentiment in traditional markets. However, the high U.S. Dollar Index could exert downward pressure on crypto assets. Bitcoin is facing challenges in maintaining its key support levels, despite strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, indicating mixed sentiment. Ethereum is underperforming due to governance concerns, while Solana shows promise with strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether remains stable amid rising gold prices, which could influence stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite facing pressure at key support levels, the strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs indicate potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to macroeconomic pressures.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum is experiencing governance concerns and underperformance relative to competitors, leading to a cautious stance despite some bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and positive developments in derivatives trading provide a bullish outlook, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the mixed sentiment in the crypto market and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining a lower allocation in USDT is advisable."
2025-02-05 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin faces pressure as it struggles to maintain support in a key price band, despite strong institutional interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, impacting its performance relative to competitors. Solana shows promise with increased activity in the DeFi derivatives space, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news. Tether and other gold-backed stablecoins are gaining traction amid record gold prices, suggesting a cautious approach to risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the pressure on price support, the strong institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs provides a positive outlook, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — The mixed sentiment and governance concerns create uncertainty, leading to a neutral stance as we await clearer signals.

SOL: +0.5 — The launch of Solana-based perpetuals and strong trading volume in DeFi derivatives indicate positive momentum, justifying a favorable allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains a hold with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.2 — While maintaining a cautious approach, the slight capital rotation into riskier assets suggests a minor reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2025-02-05 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed sentiment with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices, indicating cautious investor behavior. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting some risk appetite in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin faces pressure as it struggles to maintain key support levels, despite strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, while Solana is gaining traction with new DeFi derivatives offerings. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, and Tether benefits from the rise in gold-backed stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite strong ETF inflows, Bitcoin's struggle to maintain support levels and the current macroeconomic caution suggest reducing exposure slightly.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but governance concerns and underperformance against competitors keep the outlook neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in DeFi derivatives and stable on-chain activity support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current levels without change.

USDT: +0.3 — In a cautious macro environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a buffer against volatility."
2025-02-05 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of recovery after recent declines, supported by strong institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, BTC faces resistance in the $90k–$110k range, which could limit upside potential. Ethereum is experiencing mixed sentiment, with concerns over its governance and performance relative to competitors, despite maintaining bullish technical indicators. Solana is gaining traction in the DeFi space with the launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform, which could bolster its appeal. Dogecoin shows consistent bullish momentum but lacks significant news catalysts. Tether remains stable, with increased interest in gold-backed stablecoins amid rising gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional inflows and bullish momentum suggest potential for recovery, though resistance remains a concern. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite governance concerns, strong technical indicators and recent price gains justify a cautiously optimistic stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in DeFi derivatives and recent price increases indicate strong potential for growth. Increase exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consistent bullish momentum warrants a slight positive bias, but lack of significant news limits stronger conviction.

USDT: -0.4 — With improving sentiment in other assets, reduce stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2025-02-05 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which can create headwinds for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest through ETFs, but faces technical challenges around key price levels. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance, potentially impacting its market perception. Solana is gaining traction in the DeFi space with new product launches, which could boost its appeal. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether remains stable, with increased attention on gold-backed stablecoins due to rising gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite technical challenges, strong institutional inflows via ETFs indicate robust demand, suggesting potential for upward movement.

ETH: +0.3 — While facing governance scrutiny, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive, supporting a modest bullish stance.

SOL: +0.6 — The launch of Solana-based perpetuals with strong early volume is a positive development, indicating increased interest and potential price appreciation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall positive sentiment and potential for capital appreciation in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2025-02-05 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish and bearish signals across different assets. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional demand, as evidenced by significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, although it faces pressure from macroeconomic factors like tightening liquidity. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, which may dampen investor confidence despite its technical indicators showing bullish momentum. Solana is gaining traction in the DeFi space with Raydium's new perpetuals platform, indicating growing interest and activity. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether benefits from the surge in gold prices, suggesting a potential shift towards gold-backed stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite some bearish macroeconomic pressures, strong institutional demand and positive momentum indicators suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish technical indicators are somewhat offset by governance concerns, but overall sentiment remains cautiously positive.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in the DeFi space and increased trading activity support a stronger buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a hold position.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2025-02-05 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which may exert pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest through ETF inflows, although it faces technical resistance around the $90k–$110k range. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, which may affect its performance relative to competitors. Solana is seeing positive developments with the launch of a new derivatives platform, potentially boosting its DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether remains stable, with gold-backed stablecoins gaining attention due to rising gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite technical resistance, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs indicate robust demand, supporting a moderately positive outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing governance concerns, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and a buy signal from technical indicators, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: +0.6 — The launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform and strong trading volume provide a bullish catalyst, enhancing Solana's appeal in the DeFi space.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral, lacking clear directional signals.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT is justified."
2025-02-05 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed sentiment with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices, suggesting cautious market behavior. The S&P 500 is at a high level, indicating some risk-on sentiment, but the relatively low VIX suggests limited immediate volatility. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional demand through ETFs, yet faces pressure around its current price level. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance, which may affect its appeal. Solana is gaining traction in the DeFi space with new product launches, while Dogecoin remains stable without significant news. Tether's stability is reinforced by the rise in gold prices, benefiting its gold-backed stablecoin variant.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional demand through ETFs is a positive indicator, but price pressure in a key range suggests cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite governance concerns, technical indicators remain bullish, warranting a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong DeFi activity and positive volume trends support a bullish stance, indicating potential for growth.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential growth opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing pressure due to macroeconomic factors and Ethereum facing scrutiny over its governance. Bitcoin's ETF inflows indicate strong institutional interest, yet it struggles with maintaining key support levels. Ethereum's technical indicators remain bullish, although its governance issues may weigh on sentiment. Solana shows potential with increased DeFi activity, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or developments. The macroeconomic context, with high gold prices and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach, potentially favoring stablecoins like USDT for risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite ETF inflows and bullish momentum, Bitcoin faces resistance in key price bands. Maintain a cautious buy stance due to mixed macroeconomic signals.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong technical indicators support a positive outlook, but governance concerns warrant a moderate allocation increase.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in DeFi derivatives and a potential price breakout suggest an opportunity for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes results in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — While maintaining some exposure for risk management, the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2025-02-05 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mix of bullish and bearish signals across different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, yet it faces pressure due to potential loss of support in a key price band. Ethereum is under scrutiny for governance issues, which might affect its performance relative to competitors. Solana shows promise with the launch of a new derivatives platform, indicating strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether remains stable amidst rising gold prices, which could influence gold-backed stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the risk of losing support, strong institutional inflows and bullish momentum suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but governance concerns and underperformance relative to peers warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive developments in the DeFi space with the launch of Raydium's perpetuals, although technical indicators are not yet bullish.

DOGE: -0.1 — Lack of significant news and recent price decreases suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions, a moderate reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential upward movements in other assets."
2025-02-05 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic environment remains stable, but the high gold prices are drawing attention to gold-backed stablecoins, indicating a potential shift in risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite strong ETF inflows, Bitcoin's price is under pressure, and it risks losing key support levels. This suggests a cautious approach, reducing exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum faces governance concerns and underperformance issues, leading to a slightly negative outlook despite ongoing buy signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's increased DeFi activity and new perpetuals platform provide a positive outlook, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, a slight increase in stablecoin allocation is advisable to hedge against potential downside risks."
2025-02-05 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest through spot ETFs, yet it faces pressure due to liquidity concerns and a dip below key support levels. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance and performance issues, leading to uncertainty. Solana shows promise with strong activity in its DeFi derivatives space, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or momentum. Tether remains stable, but the broader market's risk appetite is uncertain, with gold-backed stablecoins gaining traction amid rising gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price dip, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest a positive long-term outlook. The current price pressure may offer a buying opportunity.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum faces governance concerns and underperformance, leading to a neutral stance. The lack of clear bullish signals and mixed sentiment warrant caution.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's strong DeFi derivatives activity indicates growing interest and potential upside, although technical indicators remain bearish.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains a hold with no clear directional preference.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is suggested to capitalize on potential opportunities in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest through spot ETFs, although it faces pressure from macroeconomic factors such as tightening liquidity. Ethereum is under scrutiny for its governance and underperformance relative to competitors. Solana is seeing positive developments with the launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform, indicating strong DeFi activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news or developments, while Tether is stable with some interest in gold-backed variants due to rising gold prices. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with a slight preference for risk-on assets due to positive developments in certain sectors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the pressure from macroeconomic factors, the strong institutional demand via ETFs provides a supportive backdrop. However, the price remains under key resistance levels, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing mixed sentiment due to governance issues and underperformance. While there is no immediate sell signal, caution is advised until clearer direction emerges.

SOL: +0.6 — The launch of Raydium's perpetuals platform and strong trading volumes are positive indicators for Solana, suggesting potential for growth in the DeFi space.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the cautious optimism in the market and positive developments in risk assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-02-05 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable market with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 15.77. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong at 107.58, which could exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is facing challenges, with its price below a key support level and no strong technical buy signals, despite institutional interest through ETFs. Ethereum shows a mixed outlook with governance concerns, although technical indicators suggest potential buying interest. Solana is gaining traction in the DeFi space with Raydium's new platform, which could boost its appeal. Dogecoin lacks significant news or technical signals, while Tether remains stable, with some interest in gold-backed alternatives due to rising gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional inflows into ETFs, Bitcoin faces technical challenges and macroeconomic headwinds, suggesting a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum faces governance scrutiny, its technical indicators show some buying interest, warranting a slight positive bias.

SOL: +0.5 — Strong DeFi developments and increased trading activity on Solana provide a positive outlook, making it a preferred allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals results in a neutral stance for Dogecoin.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the uncertain market conditions and Bitcoin's technical challenges, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT for stability is prudent."
2025-02-05 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a cautious undertone. Bitcoin is facing pressure as it dips below a key support level, despite strong institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum is under scrutiny due to governance concerns, which may impact its performance relative to competitors. Solana shows promise with increased activity in its DeFi derivatives space, while Dogecoin lacks significant news or developments. The macroeconomic context, with high gold prices and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stability over aggressive risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite strong ETF inflows, Bitcoin is struggling to maintain key support levels, indicating potential downside risk in the short term.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's governance concerns and underperformance relative to peers create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in the DeFi space and strong trading volumes suggest potential upside, making Solana relatively attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals results in a neutral position for Dogecoin.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential downside risks in other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-02-05 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.
