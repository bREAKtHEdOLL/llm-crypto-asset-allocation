2024-11-26 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop after approaching the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection. Ethereum, despite a record in open interest, is also facing downward pressure, though it shows some bullish sentiment due to increased USDT activity on its network. Solana and Dogecoin have both seen significant price declines, with Solana facing additional pressure from a large whale sell-off. In this environment, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst the volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite recent price increases, BTC faces significant downside risk and bearish sentiment, with analysts predicting further declines. The lack of a buy signal and increased transaction activity suggest caution.

ETH: +0.3 — While ETH has shown some resilience with bullish sentiment in derivatives, the mixed technical signals and recent price declines warrant a cautious but slightly positive outlook.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's significant price drop and bearish pressure from whale activity suggest a need to remain cautious, despite normal on-chain activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although DOGE has seen a sharp price drop, the launch of a new ETP and bullish sentiment among some traders provide a neutral outlook.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with significant price volatility and mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening demand, as indicated by a price gap between Coinbase and Binance. Ethereum, on the other hand, shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on its network, suggesting strong trader activity. Solana faces bearish pressure following a major sell-off and a broader market correction, while Dogecoin's recent price drop is seen as a potential buying opportunity despite the launch of a new ETP. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and profit-taking suggest caution, especially with potential downside risks highlighted by analysts. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a bullish outlook, despite mixed technical signals.

SOL: 0.0 — Bearish sentiment from a significant price drop and whale sell-off, but no current holdings to reduce. Awaiting clearer signals before considering entry.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the recent drop, the launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment among traders provide a mild positive signal.

USDT: +0.3 — Maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins due to overall market volatility and potential downside risks, providing a safe haven amid uncertain conditions."
2024-11-26 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a bearish tilt, particularly for Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin's recent attempt to breach the $100K mark was met with significant profit-taking and a subsequent drop, indicating potential further downside risk. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on its network. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a notable whale sell-off and a broader market correction. Dogecoin, despite a recent price drop, has seen some positive sentiment with the launch of a new ETP, suggesting a mixed outlook. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility and bearish news, the lack of current holdings and potential for a bounce back suggest a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment from record open interest and increased USDT activity on Ethereum supports a positive allocation, especially given existing holdings.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent sell-off and bearish sentiment from whale activity suggest caution, but no current holdings mean no reduction is possible.

DOGE: +0.2 — The launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment amid broader market weakness justify a slight positive allocation, considering current holdings.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the overall cautious market sentiment, maintaining a stablecoin position is prudent to manage risk, despite the slight bullish signals in other assets."
2024-11-26 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, as Bitcoin struggles to maintain its position after nearing the $100K mark, leading to profit-taking and increased downside protection. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, indicating rising trader activity. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale, while Dogecoin's recent ETP launch in the Nordics provides some positive sentiment despite a sharp price drop. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could be contributing to the cautious sentiment in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not a priority for new allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Record open interest and bullish sentiment in derivatives markets indicate potential upside. Current holdings suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off create uncertainty. No current holdings, so maintain a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price drop, the launch of a DOGE ETP provides a positive long-term sentiment. Current holdings justify a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — Stable macroeconomic indicators and cautious market sentiment support maintaining current stablecoin holdings for liquidity and risk management."
2024-11-26 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with significant volatility and profit-taking observed, especially in Bitcoin, which recently experienced a sharp decline after nearing the $100K mark. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious risk environment. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, while Solana and Dogecoin have faced recent price declines amid broader market corrections. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven during market turbulence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and warnings of further downside suggest caution. Lack of current holdings allows for a neutral to slightly negative stance given market conditions.

ETH: +0.5 — Record open interest and regained USDT dominance indicate bullish sentiment, justifying increased exposure despite recent price stability.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent price drop and whale sell-off, the potential for recovery and market correction offers a moderate buy opportunity.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the launch of a new ETP, the recent price drop and low on-chain activity suggest a hold position, balancing potential buying opportunities against market weakness.

USDT: +0.6 — With market volatility and potential downside risks in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with a record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on its network. Solana is under pressure due to a major sell-off and a broader market correction, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp price drop, has seen some positive developments with the launch of a new ETP. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stability over aggressive risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price drops and bearish news, BTC's potential for a rebound and its role as a market leader warrant a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from record open interest and increased USDT activity on Ethereum supports a moderate buy signal, despite recent price stability.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent sell-off and bearish pressure from whale activity suggest reducing exposure, especially given current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent price drop but potential buying interest; maintain current holdings without increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of bearish market conditions and the need for stability, maintaining a higher USDT allocation is prudent to manage risk."
2024-11-26 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, driven by recent profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, particularly in Bitcoin. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing the $100K mark and potential for further downside has created a cautious environment. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, but the broader market correction is impacting its price stability. Solana is under pressure due to a significant sell-off and weak ecosystem performance, while Dogecoin's recent ETP launch in the Nordics has not prevented a price drop, though some traders remain optimistic. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. Lack of current holdings allows for a neutral stance, but market sentiment is bearish.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the broader market correction, the record open interest in derivatives indicates bullish sentiment, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant sell-off and weak ecosystem performance create bearish pressure. Current holdings suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the price drop, the launch of the ETP and some bullish sentiment among traders suggest holding the current position without changes.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and the need for a safe haven, maintaining a higher USDT exposure is prudent to manage risk."
2024-11-26 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable pullback after approaching the $100K mark, indicating profit-taking and a potential for further downside. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although its price has slightly decreased. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale and a broader market correction. Dogecoin has launched a new ETP, which could increase regulated access, but its price has dropped significantly, though some traders remain optimistic. Tether remains stable with no significant news, suggesting a consistent demand for stability amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction possible.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite slight price decrease, record open interest and USDT supply increase on Ethereum indicate bullish sentiment.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure. Current holdings suggest a cautious reduction.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite price drop, the launch of a new ETP and mixed trader sentiment suggest holding current position.

USDT: +0.5 — Increased volatility and potential downside in other assets make USDT a safer allocation for stability."
2024-11-26 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent drop from near $100K has triggered profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, while Ethereum's derivatives market activity suggests some bullish sentiment despite price declines. Solana and Dogecoin have both experienced notable price drops, with Solana facing additional bearish pressure from a large whale sell-off. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stability and liquidity. In this context, USDT remains a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not a favorable buy at this time.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite price declines, record open interest in derivatives indicates potential for recovery. Maintain current holdings with a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off increase bearish sentiment. Reduce exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent sharp decline and low on-chain activity suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly to manage risk.

USDT: +0.6 — Favorable as a stable asset in current volatile conditions. Increase exposure to preserve capital and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, after approaching the $100K mark, has experienced a notable decline, driven by profit-taking and concerns about weakening demand. Ethereum's derivatives market shows increased activity, suggesting some underlying bullish sentiment, but its price remains under pressure. Solana and Dogecoin have both faced substantial declines, with Solana impacted by a large whale sell-off and Dogecoin seeing a sharp drop despite some bullish trader sentiment. In this environment, USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — While Bitcoin has experienced a significant price drop, there is no clear buy signal due to the potential for further downside as indicated by recent news and technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the price decline, the record open interest in derivatives suggests some bullish sentiment, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — The recent whale sell-off and price drop indicate bearish pressure, justifying a slight reduction in exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: -0.3 — The sharp decline and low on-chain activity suggest caution, with a slight reduction in allocation to mitigate potential losses.

USDT: +0.4 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for flexibility in future reallocation."
2024-11-26 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K and Ethereum's record open interest suggest heightened volatility and mixed market signals. Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced substantial sell-offs, with notable whale activity impacting SOL. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market downturns. The macroeconomic context, including a strong U.S. dollar and low volatility in traditional markets, further supports a cautious approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential further downside suggest caution. Lack of current holdings allows for a neutral stance, but overall bearish sentiment warrants a negative score.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bearish price action, record open interest indicates potential for future upside. Current holdings justify maintaining position without increasing exposure.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and whale sell-off create bearish pressure. Current holdings suggest reducing exposure to minimize risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — Sharp price drop and low on-chain activity indicate bearish sentiment. Current holdings should be reduced to manage risk.

USDT: +0.6 — Stable performance amid market volatility makes USDT an attractive safe haven, justifying increased allocation to preserve capital."
2024-11-26 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has recently experienced a sharp drop after nearing the $100K mark, with analysts predicting further downside due to weakening demand. Ethereum, despite a record surge in derivatives open interest, is also facing price pressure, though it remains a key network for USDT. Solana and Dogecoin have both seen substantial price declines, with Solana facing additional bearish pressure from a large whale sell-off. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: 0.0** — Despite recent price declines and bearish news, Bitcoin's long-term potential remains intact. However, current market conditions suggest caution, warranting a neutral stance.

**ETH: +0.2** — Ethereum's strong derivatives activity and its regained position as the leading network for USDT indicate underlying strength, suggesting a slight preference for holding.

**SOL: -0.3** — The recent whale sell-off and significant price drop signal potential further downside, justifying a reduction in exposure to manage risk.

**DOGE: -0.2** — Despite some bullish sentiment from the launch of a DOGE ETP, the overall market weakness and recent price drop suggest a cautious approach, slightly reducing exposure.

**USDT: +0.5** — Given the bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for flexibility in future capital deployment."
2024-11-26 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has seen a notable drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum's derivatives market is showing bullish sentiment with record open interest, but the price remains under pressure.

Despite the bearish conditions, some traders remain optimistic about Dogecoin, viewing the dip as a buying opportunity. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant price drop and warnings of further downside suggest caution. With no current holdings, a negative score is not applicable, but a cautious stance is warranted.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the price pressure, the record open interest in derivatives indicates potential bullish sentiment. Maintaining a slight positive allocation reflects this mixed outlook.

SOL: -0.3 — The significant price drop and whale sell-off signal bearish sentiment. With current holdings, reducing exposure is prudent to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite a sharp drop, some traders see a buying opportunity. However, the overall bearish market conditions and current holdings suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to preserve capital and reduce risk."

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has recently experienced a sharp decline after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening demand. Ethereum, despite a record surge in derivatives open interest, is also under pressure, with its price showing signs of breakdown. Solana is facing bearish pressure due to a significant whale sell-off, and Dogecoin, despite a recent ETP launch, has seen a notable price drop. In contrast, USDT remains stable, reflecting a cautious market environment where investors might be seeking safety in stablecoins amidst heightened volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines and bearish sentiment, BTC's strong on-chain activity suggests potential resilience. However, the risk of further downside warrants a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Rising open interest and USDT supply on Ethereum indicate underlying bullish sentiment, despite current price weakness. A cautious buy signal is justified.

SOL: -0.3 — The recent whale sell-off and broader market correction suggest further downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent given current bearish conditions.

DOGE: -0.2 — Although the ETP launch is a positive development, the sharp price drop and overall market weakness suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly is advisable.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is strategic for capital preservation."
2024-11-26 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bearish and bullish signals. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection. Analysts are warning of potential further downside, particularly with weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with a record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply, indicating strong trader activity. Solana is under pressure due to a significant price drop and a major whale sell-off, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp decline, has seen some bullish sentiment with the launch of a new ETP. Tether remains stable with no significant news, suggesting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and warnings of further downside suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction possible, but not a preferred asset for new allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a moderate buy signal. Current holdings can be increased.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility, mixed sentiment and the launch of a new ETP provide a neutral outlook. Maintain current holdings without change.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market environment, maintaining some exposure to USDT for stability is prudent, but not a strong buy signal due to potential capital rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-11-26 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with notable volatility and mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin recently experienced a significant drop after approaching the $100K mark, with analysts warning of potential further downside due to profit-taking and weakening demand. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment in derivatives markets, but its price has been volatile. Solana is under pressure from a major sell-off, while Dogecoin, despite a recent sharp decline, has seen some optimism due to new financial products. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with no significant changes in key indicators, but the high U.S. dollar index suggests potential pressure on crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and warnings of further downside suggest caution. Lack of current holdings allows for a conservative stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility, record open interest in derivatives indicates bullish sentiment, supporting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent price drop and significant whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure. Current holdings suggest reducing exposure slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility, mixed sentiment with new ETP launch and some bullish views balance the outlook.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential downside risks in other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent."
2024-11-26 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-26 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing the $100K mark and the broader market correction affecting assets like Solana. Despite the recent price declines, there are pockets of bullish sentiment, particularly in Ethereum, where derivatives activity has surged, indicating increased trader interest. Dogecoin has seen a sharp drop, but the launch of a new ETP in the Nordics suggests potential for increased institutional interest. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach, with potential for increased volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and warnings of further downside suggest caution. No current holdings allow for a neutral to slightly negative stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong derivatives activity and regained top spot for USDT signal bullish sentiment, despite recent price fluctuations.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure. Current small holdings justify a cautious stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the price drop, the launch of the ETP could stabilize sentiment. Current holdings suggest maintaining exposure without increasing risk.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of market volatility and potential downside risks, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent for capital preservation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin experienced a notable drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum's derivatives market shows bullish sentiment with record open interest, but the price has faced downward pressure. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen significant declines, with Solana impacted by a major sell-off and Dogecoin's drop viewed by some as a buying opportunity. In contrast, USDT remains stable with no significant news, but its presence on Ethereum has increased, indicating a shift in stablecoin network preference.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, recent price drops and concerns over U.S. demand suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.2 — Record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum show bullish sentiment, but recent price declines warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure. Current holdings suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a sharp price drop, the launch of a DOGE ETP and some bullish sentiment among traders suggest holding current positions.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-11-26 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious, with recent price corrections across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's near approach to $100K was met with significant profit-taking, suggesting a potential for further downside, especially with analysts eyeing a dip below $90K. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment in the derivatives market, with a record open interest, although its price has been volatile. Solana is under pressure from a major sell-off and broader market correction, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp drop, has seen some bullish sentiment due to new financial products. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent profit-taking and potential downside risk suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment in derivatives and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate potential upside.

SOL: -0.4 — Recent sell-off and weak ecosystem performance suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with new ETP launch but recent price drop; hold current position.

USDT: +0.4 — Increased demand for stability amid market volatility; maintain higher exposure."
2024-11-26 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a notable drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns about weakening demand. Ethereum, despite a record surge in derivatives open interest, faces mixed signals with a slight recovery in USDT supply on its network. Solana is under pressure from a major sell-off and broader market weakness, while Dogecoin's recent ETP launch in the Nordics has not prevented a sharp decline, although some traders remain optimistic. In this environment, USDT remains relatively stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent declines and bearish news, BTC's long-term potential remains intact. However, current market conditions do not justify a strong buy or sell signal.

ETH: +0.3 — The record open interest in ETH derivatives suggests rising trader activity and potential bullish sentiment, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — The significant sell-off and bearish sentiment, coupled with weak ecosystem performance, suggest reducing exposure to SOL.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent ETP launch, DOGE's sharp decline and low on-chain activity do not provide a clear signal for allocation changes.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher USDT exposure is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2024-11-26 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening demand, suggesting potential further downside. Ethereum, however, shows bullish signs with record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity and positive sentiment. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a major sell-off and market correction, with analysts eyeing $200 as a critical support level. Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline but maintains some bullish sentiment due to new market opportunities like the launch of a DOGE ETP. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction is possible, but avoid new allocations.

ETH: +0.5 — Record open interest and positive sentiment in derivatives markets indicate potential for upward movement. Current holdings support maintaining exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent sell-off and bearish pressure warrant caution. Current holdings suggest a slight reduction to manage risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a sharp drop, the launch of a new ETP provides a potential bullish catalyst. Maintain current holdings without increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the bearish sentiment in other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a mix of profit-taking and potential downside risks, particularly for Bitcoin, which has recently experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark. Analysts are concerned about further declines, especially with weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, suggesting increased trader activity. Solana is under pressure from a significant sell-off and broader market corrections, while Dogecoin, despite a recent price drop, has seen some positive developments with the launch of a new ETP. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. dollar and low volatility, suggests a cautious approach may be warranted, with potential for capital preservation strategies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside make BTC less attractive. No current holdings allow for a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Rising open interest and bullish sentiment suggest potential for gains, justifying increased exposure.

SOL: -0.1 — Despite bullish momentum signals, recent significant sell-offs and market corrections warrant caution. Current holdings should be maintained but not increased.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the launch of a new ETP, the recent price drop and mixed sentiment suggest a hold position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.2 — In light of potential market volatility and downside risks, maintaining a higher USDT allocation for capital preservation is prudent."
2024-11-26 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with signs of potential bearish trends across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has recently experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening demand. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment in derivatives markets, but its price remains stable with no significant upward momentum. Solana and Dogecoin have both faced recent price declines, with Solana impacted by a major sell-off and Dogecoin showing some bullish sentiment despite its drop. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and stable indices, suggesting a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not a priority for allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite stable price, strong derivatives activity and USDT supply increase on Ethereum indicate potential for upward movement.

SOL: -0.2 — Price decline and whale sell-off create bearish pressure. Current small holding suggests a cautious stance.

DOGE: +0.1 — Despite recent price drop, new ETP and some bullish sentiment provide a slight positive outlook.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for further downside in major cryptos, maintaining a higher USDT allocation is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-11-27 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding towards the $100K mark after a dip, supported by a significant $15T position that stabilized the market. Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased network activity. Solana continues its upward trajectory, driven by strong on-chain and derivatives data, and has seen a notable increase in DEX volume. Dogecoin's market cap has surged, driven by speculation and high-profile endorsements, though it faces resistance at $0.40. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, with a rising supply as it retires its euro stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The rebound towards $100K and stabilization efforts indicate renewed bullish sentiment, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong futures open interest and increased network activity suggest a positive outlook, supporting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.7 — Continued rally with strong on-chain support and DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's highlights Solana's relative strength.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite positive market cap developments, the significant resistance at $0.40 and recent price volatility warrant a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable."
2024-11-27 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of recovery after a recent dip, supported by significant market interventions. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana is gaining traction with a rally towards $300, driven by high DEX volumes surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin's market cap has surged, driven by speculative interest and nearing a key resistance level. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although the focus is shifting due to regulatory changes in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with renewed bullish sentiment and strong market support, suggesting potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum with record futures interest and increased on-chain activity, making it highly attractive.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive price action and high DEX volumes indicate strong market interest and potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's market cap surge and approach to a key resistance level suggest potential for a breakout, though speculative risks remain.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, there's a reduced need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-27 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of recovery after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This rebound has been supported by significant market interventions, which have stabilized the broader crypto market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity, indicating renewed investor confidence. Solana continues to perform well, driven by high DEX volumes and positive price action, suggesting strong market support. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by speculative interest and media attention, while Tether maintains its dominance in the stablecoin market amid regulatory shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's recent rebound and strong market interventions suggest a bullish outlook. The news of a large position stabilizing the market adds confidence to its upward trajectory.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased activity signal strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive price movement and high DEX volumes indicate strong market support, making it a favorable asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While speculative interest is high, Dogecoin is testing resistance levels, suggesting potential for upward movement, albeit with caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-11-27 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest and market activity, indicating strong bullish momentum. Solana continues to rally, supported by high on-chain activity and DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, with market cap growth driven by speculation and media attention. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its supply increasing, reinforcing its dominance in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with renewed bullish sentiment and significant market support after a recent dip. The news of a massive BTC position stabilizing the market further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum with record futures open interest and increased market activity. The price breakout above the upper Bollinger Band also suggests potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is rallying with strong on-chain and derivatives data support. The news of DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's adds to its bullish case, indicating strong market interest and potential for further price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels with growing market cap and positive sentiment driven by speculation. While the potential for a breakout exists, the risk of reversal at resistance warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding towards the $100K mark and Ethereum showing strong bullish momentum in futures markets. Solana is also experiencing positive momentum, driven by high DEX volume and on-chain activity. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by positive sentiment and speculation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its dominance in the stablecoin market reinforced by a recent increase in supply. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable S&P 500 and low volatility index, supports a risk-on environment, encouraging capital allocation towards cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong rebound and bullish sentiment, supported by significant market stabilization efforts. Positive news and technical indicators suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.9 — Record futures open interest and strong bullish momentum indicate high confidence and potential for further price increases. Ethereum's activity surge supports this outlook.

SOL: +0.7 — Positive price action and strong on-chain and DEX activity indicate continued bullish momentum, with potential to reach new highs.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with positive sentiment and market cap growth. While speculative, the potential for a breakout justifies a moderate positive score.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, supported by substantial market interventions that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures interest and activity, indicating strong bullish sentiment. Solana continues to perform well, driven by high decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes and positive on-chain data, while Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels amid speculation and increased market cap. Tether remains stable but is seeing a shift in focus due to regulatory changes in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong recovery and bullish momentum, with significant market interventions supporting its price. The positive news and technical indicators suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is benefiting from record futures interest and increased activity, indicating strong market confidence and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong performance is supported by high DEX volumes and bullish technical indicators, suggesting continued upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin is approaching key resistance with positive sentiment and market cap growth, but the potential for a reversal at resistance warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent to capitalize on the current market trends."
2024-11-27 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a substantial $15T position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana is also showing strength, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap gains fueled by speculation and high-profile endorsements. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its focus is shifting due to regulatory changes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong recovery and bullish momentum, supported by significant market stabilization efforts and positive news sentiment.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum with record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity, indicating confidence in further price appreciation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is benefiting from strong on-chain and derivatives data, with significant DEX volume indicating robust market interest and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels with positive market cap developments, though it remains more speculative compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, there is a decreased need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a reduction in USDT exposure."
2024-11-27 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed investor confidence. Ethereum's futures market is showing record open interest, indicating strong bullish momentum and growing market confidence. Solana continues to perform well, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired, reflecting a strategic shift.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with renewed bullish sentiment after a significant rebound. The news of a massive position stabilizing the market further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity suggest strong bullish momentum. The market confidence reflected in the news supports a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new highs and impressive DEX volume indicate strong market support and potential for further gains, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the market cap growth and positive news around potential breakouts suggest a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need to hold stablecoins, suggesting a rotation of capital into more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding towards the $100K mark and Ethereum experiencing a surge in futures activity, indicating strong bullish momentum. Solana is also showing significant strength, with new highs and impressive DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its dominance in the stablecoin market reinforced despite the retirement of its euro stablecoin. The macroeconomic environment, with relatively stable interest rates and a low volatility index, supports a risk-on sentiment, encouraging capital allocation into cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, along with significant market support, suggest strong upward potential. The macro context also favors risk assets.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's strong futures activity and price increase indicate robust market confidence, making it an attractive allocation.

SOL: +0.9 — Solana's new highs and leading DEX volume highlight its strong market position and potential for further gains, warranting a high allocation preference.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the speculative interest and market cap growth provide a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market leaning towards risk assets, there's a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a shift away from USDT."
2024-11-27 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding towards $100K and Ethereum futures hitting record open interest, indicating strong bullish momentum. Solana continues to show strength, with its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, while Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level amid high-profile endorsements. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, supporting a risk-on environment. However, the presence of stablecoins like USDT remains significant, reflecting a balanced approach to risk management in the current market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with renewed bullish sentiment and significant market support, making it an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity suggest robust market confidence, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's strong performance, supported by high DEX volume and positive technical indicators, makes it a compelling allocation choice.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the market cap boost and speculative interest provide a mild positive signal, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market leaning towards a risk-on sentiment, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on the bullish momentum in other assets."
2024-11-27 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-27 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip and Ethereum showing strong bullish momentum with record futures open interest. Solana continues to rally, driven by high on-chain activity and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, supported by increased market cap and speculation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capture potential gains in more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with strong upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by significant market interventions that stabilized the broader crypto market. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures activity, indicating strong bullish sentiment and increased market confidence. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by speculation and market cap growth. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite regulatory shifts affecting its euro-pegged stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with significant on-chain activity and supportive news indicating a potential push towards $100K.

ETH: +0.7 — Record futures open interest and increased market activity suggest strong bullish sentiment and potential for further price appreciation.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive price action and leading DEX volume indicate strong support and potential for continued upward movement.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with positive market cap developments, though volatility remains a risk.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-11-27 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, and Ethereum futures hitting record open interest levels, indicating strong investor confidence. Solana continues to show strength, with its price hitting new highs and DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin, EURt. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with renewed bullish sentiment and significant on-chain activity. The recent news of a massive BTC position stabilizing the market further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's price surge and leading DEX volume highlight its growing market presence and investor interest, suggesting further upside potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the market cap growth and positive sentiment from influential figures like Musk provide a moderate bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets that offer higher potential returns."
2024-11-27 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly towards the $100K mark, supported by significant market interventions that stabilized recent volatility. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures activity, indicating strong bullish momentum and renewed optimism. Solana continues to rally, driven by high on-chain activity and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange volume, highlighting its growing ecosystem. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, with market cap gains fueled by speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin is being retired, reflecting regulatory shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with supportive news and on-chain activity, indicating a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish futures activity and growing market confidence suggest positive momentum, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's strong price action and DEX volume highlight its competitive edge, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, speculative interest and market cap growth provide a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of higher-yielding assets."
2024-11-27 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding towards the $100K mark after a recent dip, signaling renewed investor confidence. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum with record futures open interest, reflecting growing market confidence. Solana is also performing well, with significant on-chain and derivatives support, and its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level at $0.40, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, Tether continues to dominate the stablecoin market, with its supply increasing as it maintains its position as a safe haven during volatile times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and bullish sentiment, supported by significant market interventions, indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market activity suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong performance and high DEX volume highlight its growing market presence, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and speculative interest provide moderate upside potential.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on growth opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This recovery has renewed positive sentiment across the crypto market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, as reflected by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues its upward trajectory, supported by high DEX volumes and a rally towards $300. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin is being retired, indicating a shift in focus.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong recovery and bullish sentiment, supported by significant market interest and a stabilizing position after recent volatility.

ETH: +0.7 — Record futures open interest and increased activity signal strong bullish momentum, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Continued rally with strong on-chain and derivatives support, along with significant DEX volume, suggests further upside potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with positive market cap developments; however, speculative nature warrants cautious optimism.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-11-27 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a sharp rebound, and Ethereum futures hitting record open interest levels, signaling strong bullish momentum. Solana continues its upward trajectory, supported by high DEX volume and strong on-chain activity, while Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels with potential for further gains. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although the broader sentiment suggests a shift towards riskier assets as the market stabilizes and recovers from recent volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and strong market support after a significant sell-off indicate a favorable environment for further gains. The bullish sentiment and technical indicators support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market confidence suggest strong upward momentum. The asset remains attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong on-chain activity and DEX volume, along with its price rally, make it an appealing asset in the current bullish market environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and positive sentiment from influential figures like Musk provide a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of recovery and risk appetite increasing, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to allocate capital towards more promising assets."
2024-11-27 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This resurgence is supported by significant market activity and large positions stabilizing the market. Ethereum also shows strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels, indicating growing confidence. Solana continues to perform well, with significant on-chain activity and DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, suggesting strong support and potential for further gains. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains a dominant force in the stablecoin market, though its role may shift as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with significant market stabilization efforts, make it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and strong market confidence suggest continued upward momentum, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's impressive on-chain activity and DEX volume, along with its rally towards new highs, indicate strong potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderately positive outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a rotation of capital into more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant institutional inflows and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has shown strong upward momentum, fueled by ETF inflows and institutional interest, although the impending options expiry introduces some caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with technical indicators suggesting further gains. Solana benefits from growing institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by the ETF filing and increased TVL. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume and price, indicating renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with strategic expansions enhancing its liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and institutional interest. Despite the options expiry, the market sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains as indicated by technical indicators and ETF inflows. The market sentiment is supportive of a price increase.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive news from the ETF filing and significant ecosystem growth support a bullish outlook. Institutional interest is a key driver.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant increase in trading volume and price suggests renewed investor interest. However, the low on-chain activity tempers the bullish sentiment slightly.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market showing bullish trends, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-28 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and ETF inflows are driving Bitcoin's price higher, despite some caution around options expiry. The overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from bullish momentum and ETF inflows, with technical indicators suggesting potential for further upside.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth are bolstering Solana's attractiveness, supported by positive news and technical signals.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant trading volume and price increase indicate renewed interest, though the asset remains speculative with potential for volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-11-28 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving up prices for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news regarding potential price targets suggest further upside, making Ethereum an attractive asset to hold and potentially increase exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — The surge in trading volume and optimistic price predictions suggest potential upside, though the asset remains speculative compared to others.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall bullish sentiment and increased risk appetite, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price surges in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent price increase past $95K is supported by strong ETF inflows and institutional interest, although the upcoming expiry of $13.6 billion in Bitcoin options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with predictions of further price increases supported by technical indicators and ETF inflows. Solana is gaining attention due to a new ETF filing and substantial ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin has seen a significant increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. In contrast, Tether's focus on expanding USDT's reach highlights its strategic adjustments in response to regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving positive momentum, although upcoming options expiry suggests some caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators, though recent price stability warrants moderate optimism.

SOL: +0.4 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive, but recent price stability suggests a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant increase in trading volume and renewed investor interest indicate potential upside, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, USDT's relative attractiveness decreases, but it remains a stable option for risk management."
2024-11-28 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has seen a price surge past $95K, largely due to ETF inflows, although the impending expiry of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum has broken the $3,600 mark with potential to reach $4,500, supported by strong buying pressure. Solana is experiencing growth, evidenced by a 48% increase in total value locked and interest from a new ETF filing. Dogecoin is witnessing renewed investor interest, with a substantial increase in trading volume. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving upward momentum, despite some caution due to options expiry. The overall sentiment is bullish.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and bullish technical indicators. The market sentiment is optimistic.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive indicators, with the ETF filing and increased TVL supporting a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, although the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-28 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, maintaining a lower allocation in USDT is advisable, despite its stability."
2024-11-28 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has seen a notable surge past $95K, supported by ETF inflows, although the impending expiry of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with predictions of further price increases. Solana is gaining attention due to ETF filings and ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin's trading volume has surged, indicating renewed investor interest. In contrast, Tether's recent moves, including the discontinuation of EURT and expansion on the TON blockchain, reflect strategic shifts amid regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and ETF inflows indicate positive momentum, though the options expiry suggests some caution is warranted. The overall sentiment remains bullish.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price momentum and bullish news, including ETF inflows and potential for further gains, support a positive outlook, though technicals are not yet fully aligned.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF interest are positive indicators, despite the recent price dip. The long-term outlook remains strong.

DOGE: +0.3 — The significant increase in trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, though the current technicals are mixed.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant ETF inflows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicating strong institutional interest. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K and Ethereum's break above $3,600 suggest bullish momentum, although the impending expiry of a large volume of Bitcoin options introduces some uncertainty. Solana is experiencing growth in its ecosystem, with a notable increase in total value locked and interest in a new ETF, which could drive further investment. Dogecoin has seen a substantial increase in trading volume, reflecting renewed investor interest, but its price remains volatile. Tether's expansion onto the TON blockchain indicates a strategic move to enhance liquidity, despite the discontinuation of its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's price surge and ETF inflows suggest strong institutional interest, but the large options expiry introduces potential volatility, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators, make it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF interest indicate positive sentiment, though recent price volatility suggests a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price fluctuations, the surge in trading volume and optimistic price predictions support a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital flowing into other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2024-11-28 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable ETF inflows boosting both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge past $95K, driven by institutional interest, although the impending expiry of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as technical indicators point to a possible rise to $4,500. Solana is seeing increased institutional interest and ecosystem growth, which is reflected in its rising TVL. Dogecoin is experiencing a resurgence in trading volume and price, indicating renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its reach, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and institutional interest are driving price increases, despite some caution around options expiry. The overall bullish sentiment supports a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators, make Ethereum attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and significant ecosystem growth, as indicated by TVL increase, suggest positive sentiment and potential for price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed investor interest and significant trading volume increase suggest potential upside, though the speculative nature warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is less attractive in the current market environment."
2024-11-28 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant developments across multiple assets. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge driven by ETF inflows and institutional interest, despite the looming expiration of a large volume of options, which suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also showing bullish momentum, with technical indicators pointing towards potential further gains, supported by ETF inflows. Solana's ecosystem is seeing strong growth, reflected in increased total value locked and institutional interest via ETF filings. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest and potential for further price gains. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, although the discontinuation of its EURT stablecoin highlights regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's price surge and strong institutional interest are positive, but the upcoming options expiry introduces some caution. Overall, the sentiment is moderately bullish.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further gains make it attractive, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting a potential price increase.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ecosystem growth and institutional interest via ETF filings are positive indicators, although technical signals remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.3 — The significant increase in trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, but the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullish sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-28 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum suggesting strong institutional interest. Bitcoin has recently surged past $95K, driven by ETF inflows, although the impending expiry of a large volume of options introduces some uncertainty. Ethereum is similarly buoyed by ETF inflows and bullish price targets, indicating potential for further gains. Solana is experiencing ecosystem growth, evidenced by a significant increase in total value locked and interest in a new ETF. Dogecoin's trading volume has surged, reflecting renewed investor interest, though its price has recently declined. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The strong ETF inflows and recent price surge suggest continued upward momentum, although caution is warranted due to the upcoming options expiry.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and ETF inflows, along with optimistic price predictions, support a positive outlook, though technical indicators are mixed.

SOL: +0.3 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion provide a positive backdrop, but recent price declines temper enthusiasm.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite increased trading volume, the recent price drop and lack of strong technical signals suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-28 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment across cryptocurrencies shows a mix of cautious optimism and potential for growth. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, driven by ETF inflows and institutional interest, although the impending expiry of significant options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with potential for further gains, supported by strong buying pressure and ETF inflows. Solana is gaining attention due to ETF filings and substantial growth in its ecosystem's total value locked, indicating increased investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a significant increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed interest, though its future price predictions are highly speculative. Tether remains stable, with strategic moves to expand its reach on new blockchains, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive ETF inflows and institutional interest are driving Bitcoin's price upward, although caution is warranted due to the options expiry.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains make Ethereum attractive, supported by strong buying pressure and positive news.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and significant ecosystem growth signal potential upside for Solana, despite current technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and renewed investor interest suggest potential for gains, though speculative nature warrants caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely."
2024-11-28 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum due to ETF inflows and bullish price targets. Bitcoin's recent surge past $95K, driven by significant ETF inflows, indicates strong institutional interest, although the impending expiration of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with predictions of further price increases supported by strong buying pressure. Solana is attracting institutional interest through ETF filings and ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin is seeing renewed investor interest with a significant increase in trading volume. Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, although it faces challenges with its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the cautious sentiment around options expiry, strong ETF inflows and institutional interest support a positive outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, as indicated by technical analysis and ETF inflows, make Ethereum attractive.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by ETF filings and increased TVL, provide a positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant increase in trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, warranting a moderate allocation increase.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases with bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is appropriate to allocate more capital to other assets."
2024-11-28 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has surged past $95K, supported by significant ETF inflows, although the impending expiry of Bitcoin options indicates some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as it targets $4,000 and beyond. Solana is seeing increased interest due to a new ETF filing and substantial ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin's trading volume has skyrocketed, suggesting renewed investor interest. Tether is expanding its reach with the launch of USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving Bitcoin's price upward, though caution is warranted due to the upcoming options expiry.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and ETF inflows are supporting Ethereum's price, with potential for further gains as technical indicators suggest a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive developments such as the Solana ETF filing and significant TVL growth indicate strong ecosystem confidence and investor interest.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price projections suggest renewed investor interest, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, holding a large stablecoin position is less attractive in the current market environment."
2024-11-28 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent price surge past $95K, coupled with significant ETF inflows, indicates strong institutional backing, although the impending options expiry suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as it targets $4,000. Solana is seeing growing institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by the recent ETF filing and a substantial increase in total value locked. Dogecoin has seen a significant increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest, although its price remains speculative. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its reach with strategic blockchain integrations, despite regulatory challenges affecting its euro-pegged stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving price momentum. The upcoming options expiry introduces some risk, but the overall sentiment remains bullish.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum supported by ETF inflows and potential for further gains. Technical indicators suggest a possible short squeeze, adding to the positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive indicators. The recent ETF filing and TVL growth support a favorable outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, though the asset remains speculative.

2024-11-28 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-29 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing significant psychological levels and Ethereum experiencing substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. Solana is gaining traction with increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on major platforms, while Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, although its fundamentals remain speculative. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a strong U.S. dollar index, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors. However, the lack of strong technical buy signals across most assets suggests a need for cautious allocation adjustments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, Bitcoin's strong monthly performance and nearing of key price levels suggest continued upward potential, supported by institutional mining activity.

ETH: +0.3 — Record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate positive sentiment, although mixed signals from founders warrant a moderate approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Resumed trading on Bitstamp and significant DeFi activity highlight Solana's growing ecosystem, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the absence of strong technical or fundamental support suggests a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and showing strong monthly gains. Ethereum has seen significant inflows into ETFs, indicating institutional interest, though recent price pullbacks suggest caution. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in DeFi, while Dogecoin has seen a substantial rally, likely fueled by speculative interest and high-profile discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, though concerns about its use in illicit activities persist. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and no significant changes in traditional markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news about institutional mining and price gains support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent pullbacks, significant ETF inflows and a five-month high indicate a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase.

SOL: +0.6 — Resumed trading on Bitstamp and strong DeFi activity provide a bullish case for Solana, suggesting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Substantial rally and ongoing discussions with lawmakers create a speculative opportunity, though with higher risk.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-11-29 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable surge, nearing $100K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has also seen substantial inflows into its ETFs, indicating growing investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading support in the U.S., resulting in a price increase. Dogecoin has rallied significantly, supported by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by substantial minting activity, although there are concerns about its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with a potential breakout, supported by positive news and institutional interest. Its price is nearing a significant milestone, making it attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed signals, the record inflows into Ethereum ETFs and its recent price performance suggest a moderate positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to founder-related uncertainties.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is experiencing bullish momentum with significant DeFi activity and renewed U.S. trading support, making it an appealing asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's massive rally and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures like Musk provide a positive backdrop, justifying a moderate increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall market sentiment being bullish, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT and into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-29 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and experiencing its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, although it faces mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, while Dogecoin has surged significantly, driven by broader crypto gains and potential regulatory discussions. Despite these positive trends, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, suggesting a cautious approach to risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, with significant gains and institutional mining activity supporting further growth.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has seen strong ETF inflows, mixed founder signals suggest caution. However, the overall bullish market sentiment supports a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana benefits from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on major platforms, indicating strong demand and potential for further price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Despite low on-chain activity, Dogecoin's significant price rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive outlook, warranting a moderate allocation increase.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on growth opportunities in other assets."
2024-11-29 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has shown strong upward momentum, nearing the $100K mark, driven by positive sentiment and institutional mining activity. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although mixed signals from its founder have introduced some caution. Solana's market activity is robust, with notable DeFi volume surpassing Ethereum, and recent trading resumption on Bitstamp has further bolstered its price. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, largely influenced by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum and positive institutional mining news suggest continued upward potential. The market sentiment is highly bullish, supporting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite strong ETF inflows, mixed signals from its founder introduce some caution. However, the overall market sentiment remains positive, justifying a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's impressive DeFi activity and recent trading resumption on Bitstamp provide strong bullish signals. The asset is well-positioned for further gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of strong technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a more cautious approach. However, positive sentiment and upcoming discussions with lawmakers provide some support.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish market sentiment and increased risk appetite, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-11-29 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and experiencing its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Institutional interest is evident with strong mining activity and significant inflows into Ethereum ETFs, which have surpassed those of Bitcoin. Solana is also showing strength, with increased DeFi activity and a resurgence in trading volumes following Bitstamp's re-enabling of SOL trading in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader crypto gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see demand, with significant minting activity, although it faces negative news regarding its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum and positive news flow, with price nearing a significant psychological level of $100K. Institutional mining activity further supports bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has seen record ETF inflows, technical indicators remain neutral. The recent pullback suggests caution, but the overall sentiment is positive due to strong institutional interest.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana benefits from increased DeFi activity and positive news regarding trading resumption in the U.S., supporting its bullish momentum and price breakout signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite low on-chain activity, Dogecoin's recent price rally and potential discussions with lawmakers provide a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish trends, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-29 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and showing strong institutional mining activity. Ethereum's ETF inflows are robust, although recent price pullbacks suggest mixed sentiment. Solana is experiencing significant DeFi activity, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, and its U.S. trading resumption on Bitstamp is a positive catalyst. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader crypto gains and potential regulatory discussions involving Musk. Tether continues to see high demand, although recent news highlights its use in illicit activities, which could pose regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish sentiment with Bitcoin nearing $100K and positive institutional mining activity. Technical indicators support further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent pullbacks, strong ETF inflows and previous highs suggest potential for recovery. Mixed sentiment warrants cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments with Bitstamp resuming U.S. trading and significant DeFi activity bolster bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a boost, but low on-chain activity suggests caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish market sentiment, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-11-29 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and achieving its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Institutional interest is evident in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, with significant inflows into Ethereum ETFs. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in activity, particularly in DeFi, as evidenced by its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin has seen a substantial rally, driven by broader crypto gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although recent news highlights its involvement in illicit activities, which could pose regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional mining activity support continued bullish sentiment. The proximity to $100K and positive news flow further bolster confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — While technicals are mixed, the record inflows into Ethereum ETFs and recent price highs suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments with Bitstamp resuming trading and strong DeFi activity indicate a favorable environment for Solana.

DOGE: +0.4 — Significant price rally and potential regulatory discussions suggest continued interest, though the lack of strong technical signals warrants a moderate score.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent, despite its ongoing demand."
2024-11-29 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and experiencing one of its best monthly gains since 2021. Institutional interest is evident in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, with significant inflows into Ethereum ETFs. Solana is also seeing strong momentum, driven by increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, reflecting broader market enthusiasm and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see demand, though recent news highlights its use in illicit activities, which could raise regulatory concerns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with significant institutional interest and positive price action, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed signals, the strong ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a moderate buy, though caution is warranted due to potential pullbacks.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and renewed U.S. trading interest support a positive outlook, making it attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of substantial on-chain activity and potential regulatory discussions suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market's bullish sentiment, there's a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, though maintaining some USDT for liquidity is prudent."
2024-11-29 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and experiencing one of its best monthly gains since 2021. Ethereum is also seeing significant inflows into ETFs, indicating strong institutional interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, pushing its price higher. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, as evidenced by significant minting activity, although there are concerns about its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with bullish technical indicators and positive news regarding its price gains. Institutional mining activity further supports the bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed founder signals, the record inflows into Ethereum ETFs and its recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, albeit with some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is experiencing strong DeFi activity and positive news from Bitstamp, indicating a bullish trend. The technical indicators also support further price increases.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's significant rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop, although the technical indicators are less decisive compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — While USDT remains in demand, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests a rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2024-11-29 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $98K and achieving its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founder. Solana is experiencing a surge in DeFi activity, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, and positive news from Bitstamp has further boosted its appeal. Dogecoin has had a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential discussions with lawmakers. Tether continues to see high demand, with significant minting activity, although there are concerns about its use in illicit activities. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a low VIX, supports a risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news about mining activity and price gains support continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed signals, the significant ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in trading and DeFi activity, along with strong technical indicators, make Solana attractive.

DOGE: +0.5 — Massive recent gains and potential regulatory discussions provide a bullish backdrop, though the technicals are stabilizing.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, supported by strong institutional mining activity and a notable monthly gain. Ethereum is experiencing substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating increased investor interest, although there are mixed signals from its founder. Solana is benefiting from renewed trading activity in the U.S. and a surge in DeFi activity, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding institutional mining and price gains suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Record ETF inflows and a recent price high indicate strong investor interest, despite some mixed signals.

SOL: +0.7 — Positive developments from increased trading activity and DeFi volume support continued growth potential.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive outlook, though the asset remains volatile.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in the market, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities in other assets."
2024-11-29 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive sentiment, marking one of its best monthly performances since 2021. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into its ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the DeFi space, which has surpassed Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin has also seen a massive rally, supported by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news, including nearing $100K and robust institutional mining activity, make BTC highly attractive.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite mixed founder signals, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs support a positive outlook for ETH.

SOL: +0.5 — Resumed trading on Bitstamp and impressive DeFi activity boost SOL's attractiveness, although price fluctuations warrant some caution.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant recent rally and high-profile discussions lend support, but the potential for volatility suggests a moderate allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-11-29 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a notable increase, nearing the $100K mark, supported by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has also seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana is showing robust DeFi activity, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, and has benefited from renewed trading activity in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, with substantial minting activity, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is demonstrating strong upward momentum with significant price gains and positive on-chain activity. The bullish sentiment and institutional interest provide a solid foundation for further appreciation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite a slight recent pullback, Ethereum's strong ETF inflows and high market interest suggest continued potential for growth. The overall bullish market sentiment supports a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's impressive DeFi activity and renewed trading in the U.S. market indicate strong growth prospects. The asset's positive technical indicators further bolster its attractiveness.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's significant rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop, although the asset remains highly volatile. The overall market rally supports maintaining some exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings. Capital is likely to rotate into more volatile assets with higher growth potential."
2024-11-29 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and Ethereum seeing significant ETF inflows. Bitcoin's strong performance is supported by institutional mining activity, while Ethereum's ETF inflows indicate growing institutional interest. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, while Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, partly driven by speculative interest and potential regulatory discussions. Tether remains stable but faces scrutiny due to its involvement in illicit activities. The macroeconomic context, with a stable S&P 500 and low volatility index, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and significant institutional interest, with a potential breakout above $100K supported by bullish news and on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest continued interest, although mixed signals from founders warrant some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on major platforms boost confidence in Solana's growth potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite the recent rally, the speculative nature and low on-chain activity suggest a more cautious approach, though potential regulatory discussions could provide upside.

USDT: -0.4 — With a bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a strong rally, nearing $98K, partly driven by institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although mixed signals from its founders have introduced some caution. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest in the U.S., enhancing its attractiveness. Dogecoin has surged significantly, reflecting broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to play a crucial role in liquidity, despite some negative news regarding its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by institutional mining activity and nearing a significant psychological level, makes it a favorable asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed founder signals, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's robust DeFi activity and renewed U.S. trading interest provide a strong case for increased exposure, supported by technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.3 — The recent surge in price and potential regulatory discussions indicate positive sentiment, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a rotation of capital into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a strong rally, nearing $100K, driven by positive sentiment and institutional mining activity. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana has benefited from increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp, pushing its price higher. Dogecoin has surged significantly, partly due to broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by substantial minting activity, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by institutional mining and nearing a significant psychological price level, makes it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from its founders, the record inflows into Ethereum ETFs and its recent price performance suggest a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp provide a strong foundation for continued price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has seen a significant rally, the lack of substantial on-chain activity and potential regulatory discussions warrant a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on the current risk-on environment."
2024-11-29 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's significant rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive sentiment, though the technical indicators suggest some caution.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins like USDT, despite its recent minting activity."
2024-11-29 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable rise, nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional interest and mining activity. Ethereum has also seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating growing investor confidence, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from renewed trading activity in the U.S. and impressive DeFi performance, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin has surged significantly, fueled by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although recent news of its use in illicit activities may raise concerns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional interest, coupled with positive news, make BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from founders, strong ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in U.S. trading and exceptional DeFi activity support a bullish stance on Solana.

DOGE: +0.3 — While DOGE has seen significant gains, the potential for regulatory discussions introduces some uncertainty, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall bullish market sentiment, there is a shift away from stablecoins, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $98K and experiencing its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, although there are mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp, while Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving Elon Musk. Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although it faces negative news related to money laundering allegations. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a favorable backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong monthly performance and bullish sentiment, coupled with institutional mining activity, support a positive allocation. The technical indicators are also favorable.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from founders, the significant ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to the recent pullback.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increased DeFi activity and the resumption of U.S. trading on Bitstamp provide a strong bullish case. The technical indicators also support a buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's massive rally and upcoming discussions involving influential figures like Elon Musk provide a positive sentiment boost, although technical indicators show low activity.

USDT: -0.4 — While demand for USDT remains high, the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets. Negative news regarding money laundering also weighs on sentiment."
2024-11-30 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is focusing on scalability improvements, which could bolster its long-term potential. Solana is experiencing a price correction but maintains a bullish outlook with positive future predictions. Dogecoin, after a significant rally, is consolidating and shows potential for further gains. Tether continues to expand its supply to meet growing demand in the DeFi space, maintaining its dominance in the stablecoin market. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a mixed backdrop for risk assets, but low volatility in the S&P 500 could support continued investment in cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight recent price decrease, Bitcoin's strong November rally and increased on-chain activity suggest continued investor interest. However, the drop in dominance indicates a shift towards altcoins, warranting a balanced approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's focus on scalability and recent legal developments provide a positive long-term outlook, although current technical indicators are neutral. The asset remains attractive but not overwhelmingly so.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's recent price correction offers a potential buying opportunity, supported by bullish long-term forecasts and consistent on-chain activity. The asset is well-positioned for future gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation after a significant rally and potential for a breakout make it an interesting speculative play, though its high volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.3 — With a positive market sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly could be beneficial to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-30 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a significant rally in November. However, Bitcoin's market dominance has decreased, indicating a shift towards altcoins, suggesting the potential onset of an ""altseason."" Ethereum's recent upgrades and legal developments are promising for its scalability and regulatory clarity. Solana shows signs of a bullish trend despite recent price corrections, supported by positive AI forecasts. Dogecoin is consolidating after a substantial rally, with potential for further gains. Tether continues to expand its supply to meet DeFi and trading demand, maintaining its dominance in the stablecoin market. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a conducive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in price, Bitcoin's strong November rally and increased on-chain activity suggest continued interest and potential for further gains. However, the drop in dominance warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and legal clarity provide a positive outlook, though the lack of strong momentum signals suggests a moderate allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's bullish trend and positive AI forecasts indicate strong potential for growth, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While consolidating, Dogecoin's historical patterns and analyst predictions of further gains suggest a modest positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of risk appetite, capital rotation away from stablecoins like USDT is likely, reducing its relative attractiveness in the portfolio."
2024-11-30 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is declining as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is making strides in scalability with its Pectra upgrade, while Solana shows signs of consolidation but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, reflecting ongoing demand in DeFi and trading activities. Macroeconomic indicators, such as a relatively low VIX and stable oil prices, suggest a moderate risk environment, which could support continued investment in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued bullish sentiment. However, the lack of a bullish momentum signal tempers the score.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and recent price increases are positive, but mixed momentum signals and legal uncertainties around Tornado Cash limit the score.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's price correction appears to be a consolidation phase within a broader bullish trend, supported by positive AI price predictions.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a modest positive score, though recent price decreases warrant caution.

USDT: 0.0 — With stablecoin demand remaining strong, USDT serves as a safe haven in a cautiously optimistic market, justifying a neutral score as capital allocation remains balanced."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is seeing positive developments with its Pectra upgrade, boosting its scalability, while Solana is experiencing a price correction but maintains a bullish long-term outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical trends. The stablecoin market continues to grow, led by USDT, which remains a key player in DeFi and trading activities. The macroeconomic backdrop, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in recent hours, Bitcoin's strong November rally and potential for further gains make it attractive, though its decreasing dominance suggests some caution.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and scalability improvements from the Pectra upgrade enhance Ethereum's appeal, supported by bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a price correction, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts justify a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for significant gains based on historical trends support a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards cryptocurrencies, a reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with its recent technical upgrades and favorable court rulings, while Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, indicating strong demand in DeFi and trading sectors. Macroeconomic indicators, such as stable interest rates and moderate volatility, suggest a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight dip in dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and proximity to the $100K mark indicate continued bullish sentiment. However, the lack of a clear momentum signal tempers the score.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish momentum, technical upgrades, and favorable news provide strong support for further gains, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions suggest potential for upward movement, albeit with some caution.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for significant gains based on historical trends justify a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has decreased as capital shifts towards altcoins. Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum, supported by technical upgrades and favorable legal developments. Solana is experiencing consolidation but maintains a bullish outlook with predictions of future price increases. Dogecoin has shown significant gains and is trading within a bullish pattern, indicating potential for further upward movement. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet growing demand in the DeFi space, maintaining its dominance in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight drop in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued upward potential, making it a favorable allocation.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical upgrades provide strong support for further gains, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consolidation phase and positive long-term outlook suggest moderate potential for growth, justifying a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's recent rally and bullish trading pattern indicate potential for further gains, though with some caution due to its volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-30 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Ethereum showing strong bullish signals due to technical upgrades and positive momentum. Bitcoin has experienced a significant rally, nearing the $100K mark, although its dominance is decreasing as capital shifts towards altcoins, indicating a potential ""altseason."" Solana is consolidating after a brief dip, with forecasts suggesting continued upward movement. Dogecoin is consolidating within a bullish pattern, with potential for a breakout. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, reflecting ongoing demand in DeFi and trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While Bitcoin has shown significant gains recently, its decreasing dominance suggests a shift towards altcoins. However, its strong rally and on-chain activity support a modest positive allocation.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and strong bullish momentum make it particularly attractive. The potential for scalability improvements further supports a strong buy signal.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite a recent dip, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive forecasts for future price increases justify a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout suggest a cautious positive allocation, though its low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into altcoins, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, though its dominance has decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal news. Solana is in a consolidation phase but maintains an overall bullish trend, supported by positive forecasts. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Tether continues to expand its market presence, indicating strong demand for stablecoins, though the broader market shows a shift towards riskier assets as altcoins rise.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a recent rally, BTC's market dominance is decreasing, suggesting a shift towards altcoins. However, its strong November performance and proximity to $100K provide a moderately positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and bullish momentum signals, along with favorable legal news, make it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana is in a consolidation phase but maintains a bullish trend with positive long-term forecasts, warranting a slight positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin is consolidating after a strong rally, with potential for further gains based on historical trends and bullish technical signals.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing a shift towards riskier assets and altcoins gaining traction, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential growth in other assets."
2024-11-30 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment reflects a cautiously optimistic sentiment, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance has decreased as capital shifts towards altcoins. Ethereum shows bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, while Solana is experiencing consolidation but maintains a positive long-term outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical trends. The macroeconomic indicators, such as low volatility and stable oil prices, suggest a stable environment, but the elevated U.S. Dollar Index could pose challenges for risk assets. USDT continues to dominate the stablecoin market, indicating strong demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight dip in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K, along with increased on-chain activity, suggest continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is supported by technical upgrades and favorable legal developments, indicating strong potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.4 — Although experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts support a moderately positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for significant upside based on historical trends justify a cautious buy signal.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of risk-on sentiment, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to allocate more capital to growth assets."
2024-11-30 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The crypto market is experiencing a mixed sentiment with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance has decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal rulings, while Solana is consolidating after a minor pullback but maintains a positive long-term outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market is expanding, with Tether leading the charge, indicating strong demand for liquidity and stability in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's recent rally and strong on-chain activity suggest continued positive momentum, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical upgrades provide a strong case for increased allocation, especially given its favorable legal environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consolidation phase and positive long-term forecasts support a cautious buy signal, reflecting its potential for future gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — Although consolidating, Dogecoin's historical uptrend potential and bullish pattern suggest a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With the stablecoin market expanding, maintaining current USDT holdings is prudent to balance potential volatility in other assets."
2024-11-30 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum continues to show bullish momentum, supported by recent upgrades to improve scalability, while Solana and Dogecoin are consolidating after recent gains, indicating potential for further upward movement. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility in traditional markets, suggest a relatively stable environment for risk assets, though the high gold price might indicate some underlying caution. Tether's expansion reflects ongoing demand for stablecoins, but the broader market's risk appetite seems to be increasing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight drop in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and high transaction activity suggest continued interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Positive technical indicators and recent upgrades support a bullish outlook, making Ethereum an attractive asset in the current market environment.

SOL: +0.3 — While experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions justify a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation after a significant rally and potential for a breakout suggest a cautious buy, though the low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, its dominance has slightly decreased as investors shift focus towards altcoins, indicating a potential altseason. Ethereum shows promising signs with its scalability improvements, while Solana continues to demonstrate bullish potential despite recent price corrections. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with analysts predicting further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand, reflecting strong demand in the DeFi space. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, which supports a risk-on sentiment in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and proximity to the $100K mark suggest continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and recent scalability improvements position Ethereum favorably for growth, supported by bullish momentum in the market data.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a recent pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive forecasts indicate potential for upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and optimistic analyst predictions suggest potential for further gains, though current low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, maintaining a high exposure to USDT is less attractive in the current market environment."
2024-11-30 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction, indicating a potential shift towards an ""altseason."" Ethereum shows bullish technical indicators and positive news regarding scalability improvements, which could support further gains. Solana, despite a recent pullback, maintains a bullish outlook with predictions of continued upward momentum. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical patterns. Tether remains stable, with significant minting activity to meet DeFi and trading demand, reflecting its dominant position in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent dip in dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and proximity to the $100K mark suggest continued investor interest, warranting a moderately positive allocation.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish technical indicators and positive news regarding scalability improvements provide strong support for further gains, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — While Solana experienced a slight pullback, its overall bullish trend and positive price forecasts support a modestly positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains based on historical trends justify a slightly positive allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-30 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100K mark driven by a strong November rally, although its dominance is waning as investors shift towards altcoins, indicating a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing positive technical signals with ongoing scalability improvements, while Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase after a recent pullback but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a substantial rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its market presence, reflecting strong demand in the DeFi space. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a moderate risk environment, supporting a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and high transaction activity suggest continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and ongoing network upgrades provide a bullish outlook, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent price consolidation and bullish long-term forecasts suggest cautious optimism, but the current technicals warrant a moderate allocation increase.

DOGE: +0.1 — While consolidating within a bullish pattern, the potential for a breakout and historical uptrend support a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing positive developments with its Pectra upgrade, which could enhance scalability, while Solana is experiencing a price correction but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, indicating potential for further gains. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market continues to expand, with USDT leading the charge, reflecting ongoing demand in DeFi and trading sectors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent rally and high price levels, Bitcoin's dominance is decreasing, suggesting a shift towards altcoins. However, the strong November performance and positive sentiment keep it attractive.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's ongoing upgrades and bullish technical indicators make it appealing, despite mixed momentum signals. The potential for scalability improvements adds to its attractiveness.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's long-term bullish trend and positive AI predictions support a moderately positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for significant price increases make it an attractive option, despite low on-chain activity.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent, though maintaining some stablecoin holdings for stability is advisable."
2024-11-30 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance has decreased as capital flows into altcoins. Ethereum is showing potential for scalability improvements with the Pectra upgrade, while Solana is experiencing a price correction amidst a generally bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, indicating sustained demand for liquidity and stability in the crypto ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and proximity to the $100K mark indicate continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive developments in scalability and legal clarity around Tornado Cash provide a supportive backdrop, though technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: +0.2 — While experiencing a price correction, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions suggest potential for recovery and growth.

DOGE: +0.1 — Consolidation after a significant rally and bullish patterns suggest potential for upward movement, but the lack of strong technical signals warrants caution.

USDT: 0.0 — With the stablecoin market expanding, USDT remains a key liquidity provider, but current market conditions do not strongly favor increased or decreased allocation."
2024-11-30 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has slightly decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing signs of scalability improvements with its Pectra upgrade, while Solana's price correction indicates consolidation within a broader bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet growing demand in the DeFi space. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a moderate risk appetite, supporting a balanced approach to crypto allocations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight drop in dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and bullish momentum signal a positive outlook, warranting increased exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — The ongoing scalability improvements and legal clarity around Tornado Cash provide a supportive backdrop, though technicals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.2 — While experiencing a price correction, Solana's long-term bullish trend and positive forecasts justify a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout suggest a slight increase in exposure is prudent.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite grows and capital rotates into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate."
2024-11-30 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a significant rally in November, driven by post-election optimism. However, Bitcoin's market dominance has decreased, indicating a shift towards altcoins, suggesting a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum's recent upgrades and legal developments are positive, but technical indicators remain mixed. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase with forecasts predicting continued upward momentum. Dogecoin is consolidating after a substantial rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, indicating strong demand in DeFi and trading.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a buy signal from technical indicators, Bitcoin's recent rally and strong on-chain activity suggest continued interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and legal clarity provide a positive backdrop, although mixed momentum signals warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's consolidation and positive price forecasts support a modestly bullish stance, although technical indicators are not yet supportive.

DOGE: +0.1 — While consolidating, Dogecoin's potential for a breakout and historical uptrend support a slightly positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin demand remains strong, but with potential capital rotation into riskier assets, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent."
2024-11-30 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is seeing positive developments with scalability improvements, while Solana shows signs of consolidation but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, indicating potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether leading the charge, reflecting strong demand in DeFi and trading activities. The macroeconomic context suggests a stable environment with moderate volatility, which could support continued interest in risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent rally and strong on-chain activity suggest continued upward potential, though its declining dominance indicates some caution.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and scalability improvements provide a strong case for Ethereum, despite mixed momentum indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite recent consolidation, Solana's long-term bullish trend and positive forecasts support a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin holdings is prudent, though maintaining some exposure for liquidity is wise."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a strong bullish sentiment, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have been experiencing significant upward momentum. Bitcoin's recent rally has pushed its price close to $100K, although its market dominance is decreasing as investors shift towards altcoins, indicating a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum is also seeing positive developments with scalability improvements and favorable legal rulings. Solana is consolidating after a brief dip, with forecasts predicting continued upward momentum. Dogecoin is trading within a bullish pattern, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet demand in the DeFi space, maintaining its dominance in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with recent price gains and positive news sentiment. However, the decrease in market dominance suggests some caution as capital rotates into altcoins.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, supported by scalability improvements and legal clarity. The asset remains attractive in the current market environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana is consolidating but has a bullish outlook with potential price increases forecasted. The asset remains a favorable choice for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin is in a bullish trading pattern with potential for further gains, supported by positive historical trends and analyst predictions.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies and capital rotating into riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-30 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's dominance has decreased, suggesting a shift toward altcoins, potentially signaling the onset of an ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing positive developments with its scalability upgrades, while Solana is experiencing a slight pullback but maintains a bullish outlook for the future. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, indicating potential for further gains. Tether continues to expand its market presence, reflecting strong demand for stablecoins amid growing DeFi activity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish momentum suggest continued upward potential, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's positive technical signals and scalability improvements provide a favorable outlook, supporting a slightly stronger buy signal compared to BTC.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a minor pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts justify a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation after a significant rally and potential for further gains suggest a cautious buy signal, though less strong than other altcoins.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable, reflected in a moderate sell signal."
2024-11-30 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's market dominance is declining, indicating a shift towards altcoins, suggesting the potential onset of an ""altseason."" Ethereum's network upgrade and legal developments around Tornado Cash provide a mixed backdrop, while Solana's price correction suggests consolidation within a broader bullish trend. Dogecoin shows signs of consolidation after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet growing demand in the DeFi space, reflecting a stablecoin market that remains robust.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite a slight decline in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, warranting a moderate buy signal.

**ETH: +0.3** — Ethereum's network upgrades and bullish momentum indicators support a positive outlook, though tempered by legal uncertainties around Tornado Cash.

**SOL: 0.0** — Solana's recent price correction and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a neutral stance, as the market consolidates within a broader bullish trend.

**DOGE: +0.2** — Dogecoin's consolidation after a significant rally and potential for further gains support a modest buy signal, although technical indicators remain mixed.

**USDT: -0.3** — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted, despite Tether's ongoing expansion."
2024-12-01 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4, and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish technical indicators but faces potential risks from increased institutional involvement, which could lead to volatility. Ethereum shows consistent bullish momentum without significant news, while Solana lacks bullish signals and news catalysts. Dogecoin has seen a recent price increase but lacks strong momentum signals. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating a shift in capital allocation within stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential risks from institutional involvement, Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest bullish momentum, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent bullish momentum and technical signals support a slight increase in allocation, even in the absence of significant news.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of bullish technical signals and news leads to a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure without changes.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price increase suggests some positive sentiment, but lack of strong momentum signals justifies only a slight increase.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall positive market sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with some assets showing signs of bullish momentum while others remain stagnant or slightly bearish. Bitcoin's recent price appreciation is tempered by concerns about increased institutional involvement, which could introduce new risks. Ethereum maintains a positive trend with bullish momentum signals, although there is no significant news to drive sentiment further. Solana and Dogecoin exhibit no strong technical signals or news catalysts, suggesting a neutral stance. USDT remains stable, but its relative attractiveness is diminished by the market's focus on riskier assets, despite XRP overtaking it in market capitalization.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the potential risks from institutional involvement, Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest a mild buy signal, supported by its strong market position.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum shows consistent bullish momentum and technical strength, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant technical or news-driven signals, Solana remains neutral in the current market environment.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price volatility and low on-chain activity suggest a cautious approach, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — As market conditions favor riskier assets, maintaining a lower allocation in USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-12-01 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a consistent price decline over the past few hours, with no strong buy signals from technical indicators, and increased institutional involvement introducing new risks. Ethereum, despite having a buy signal from its moving averages, shows no bullish momentum and has seen a significant price decrease recently. Solana is facing a potential breakdown with its price falling below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating bearish pressure. Dogecoin has shown significant price volatility but lacks bullish momentum. USDT remains stable, with a bullish momentum signal, suggesting a preference for safety amid market uncertainty. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and low volatility, supports a cautious approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, the lack of bullish momentum and recent price declines suggest caution. The potential risks from institutional involvement further justify a slight reduction in exposure.

ETH: +0.1 — While technical indicators suggest a buy, the recent price drop and lack of significant news warrant a cautious approach. A slight increase in allocation is justified given its relative strength compared to other assets.

SOL: -0.4 — The potential breakdown and lack of bullish signals indicate a bearish outlook. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current technical setup.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility, the lack of bullish momentum and significant news suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — With market uncertainty and bearish signals in other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and capital preservation opportunity."
2024-12-01 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's price has been relatively stable with slight fluctuations, but the news of increased institutional involvement introduces potential volatility. Ethereum has shown a slight increase in price recently, but without significant news, it remains somewhat neutral. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced minor price changes, with no significant news to drive sentiment. Tether remains stable, although it has been overtaken by XRP in market capitalization, which might influence its perceived stability. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious, with some bullish signals in technical indicators for certain assets, but no strong momentum across the board.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of strong bullish momentum, the potential for institutional adoption provides a moderate positive outlook. However, the risks associated with this involvement warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators suggest a slight positive bias, but the absence of significant news keeps the outlook moderate.

SOL: 0.0 — With no buy signals and no significant news, Solana remains neutral. The slight price increase does not justify a change in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, the lack of supporting news or strong technical signals results in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the cautious market sentiment and the recent overtaking by XRP, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT provides a hedge against potential volatility in other assets."
2024-12-01 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some assets showing signs of recovery after recent declines. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce new risks but also suggests potential for further price appreciation. Ethereum maintains a buy signal on its trend indicators, though momentum remains weak. Solana and Dogecoin have shown slight price increases, but lack strong technical or news-driven catalysts. Tether remains stable, but its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been overtaken by XRP, which might influence its perceived stability and utility in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and recent price stabilization suggest potential for upside, though caution is warranted due to new risks.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signal on trend indicators supports a positive outlook, despite weak momentum.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of strong technical or news-driven catalysts keeps Solana in a neutral position.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite slight price recovery, there are no significant changes in data or sentiment to justify a directional move.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive sentiment in risk assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong at 106.21, which could exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility due to the potential for large-scale movements. Ethereum and Solana lack significant news, but Ethereum's technical indicators show a persistent buy signal despite a lack of bullish momentum. Dogecoin's technicals are mixed with no significant news, while Tether remains stable but has been surpassed by XRP in market capitalization, indicating a shift in investor interest.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of technical buy signals, the increased institutional interest could drive future demand. However, the potential risks associated with this involvement warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators suggest potential for upward movement, but lack of momentum and significant news keeps the score moderate.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant technical or news-driven catalysts. The asset is stable but lacks clear direction, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.1 — Slightly bearish due to low on-chain activity and lack of significant news, but no strong sell signals given current holdings.

USDT: +0.6 — With the current macroeconomic environment and market conditions, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for potential opportunities."
2024-12-01 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX at 13.4, and a strong S&P 500 index at 6042.23. The U.S. Dollar Index is moderately high at 106.21, which could exert some pressure on crypto assets. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which introduces both opportunities and risks due to potential volatility from strategic reserve discussions. Ethereum and Solana lack significant news, while Dogecoin shows no major changes. Tether's position has been slightly impacted by XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, suggesting a potential shift in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of technical buy signals, the increased institutional interest could drive future demand, warranting a cautious positive stance.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators, though lacking momentum, suggest a modestly positive outlook. The absence of significant news keeps the sentiment neutral.

SOL: 0.0 — With no buy signals and stable on-chain activity, Solana remains neutral. The lack of significant news or technical momentum doesn't justify a change in allocation.

DOGE: -0.1 — Although there is a slight upward price movement, the lack of strong technical or news-driven catalysts suggests a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the stable macro environment and potential volatility in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable for risk management."
2024-12-01 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment exhibits a mixed sentiment with no strong bullish or bearish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent price appreciation has been accompanied by increased institutional interest, which introduces potential risks due to its rapid valuation changes. Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin show no significant news-driven catalysts, while technical indicators suggest a lack of strong momentum. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating shifts in market dynamics. Overall, the macroeconomic indicators such as the stable S&P 500 and low volatility index suggest a relatively calm broader market environment, which may support a cautious approach to crypto allocations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Despite institutional interest, the lack of strong technical buy signals and potential risks from rapid appreciation suggest a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators and stable on-chain activity make ETH relatively attractive, though lacking strong momentum.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant technical or news-driven catalysts, with normal on-chain activity and no clear directional signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite slight price increases, the lack of significant news or strong technical signals suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential risks in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-12-01 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. dollar index and low volatility in the S&P 500, which suggests a neutral to slightly positive sentiment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent price increase and bullish momentum signal indicate a potential shift in sentiment, although institutional adoption introduces new risks. Ethereum maintains a buy trend signal, but lacks strong momentum, while Solana and Dogecoin show mixed technical signals with no significant news to drive sentiment. Tether remains stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, which may influence perceptions of its relative attractiveness.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the risks associated with institutional adoption, the recent price increase and bullish momentum suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's consistent buy trend signal and stable price action support a positive outlook, although the lack of significant news and momentum tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's recent price increase and normal on-chain activity suggest some positive sentiment, but the absence of a strong buy signal limits the score.

DOGE: +0.1 — Dogecoin's bullish momentum and slight price increase provide a modestly positive outlook, though low on-chain activity keeps the score conservative.

USDT: -0.3 — With the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets given the overall market sentiment, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum, particularly in the short-term technical indicators. Bitcoin's recent price appreciation is attracting increased institutional interest, which introduces both opportunities and risks. Ethereum and Solana have shown consistent buy signals in their trend indicators, though without significant news catalysts. Dogecoin has maintained a positive momentum signal, albeit with low on-chain activity. Meanwhile, Tether's stablecoin status remains strong, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating a potential shift in capital allocation preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum and increased institutional interest suggest potential for further gains, though the risks associated with rapid price appreciation should be monitored.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals in trend indicators, but lack of significant news keeps the score moderate. The technical outlook remains positive.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite a lack of buy signals in trend indicators, the recent price increase and normal on-chain activity suggest some potential for upward movement.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although there is bullish momentum, low on-chain activity and lack of significant news keep the score neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals across several cryptocurrencies, there is a moderate preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capture potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-12-01 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of bullish momentum despite some mixed signals. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which introduces both opportunities and risks amid its rapid price appreciation. Ethereum and Solana have no significant news but show stable on-chain activity. Dogecoin has shown some price volatility but lacks significant news to drive sentiment. Tether remains stable, though its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been overtaken by XRP, which could influence its perceived stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite institutional risks, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains. Maintain a moderate positive stance.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, but consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity warrant a slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana lacks significant news and shows no clear buy signal, resulting in a neutral stance. Maintain current exposure without increasing or decreasing.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price decrease and lack of significant news suggest a cautious approach. Slightly reduce exposure to manage risk.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally optimistic market sentiment, reduce stablecoin holdings slightly to allocate more towards growth assets."
2024-12-01 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by bullish technical indicators and increased institutional interest, although this also introduces new risks. Ethereum maintains a stable outlook with consistent buy signals, but lacks significant news to drive momentum. Solana's technical indicators show mixed signals, but it is experiencing bullish momentum. Dogecoin is showing bullish momentum despite low on-chain activity, indicating potential speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, but faces competitive pressure from XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, suggesting a potential shift in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and institutional interest suggest continued upward movement, despite potential risks.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and stable market conditions, but lacking strong news catalysts.

SOL: +0.2 — Bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity, but no significant news to drive a stronger signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, low on-chain activity and lack of news keep the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, especially with competitive pressure from XRP."
2024-12-01 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX and a strong S&P 500 index. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum in both price and on-chain activity, supported by institutional interest, which could drive further gains despite the associated risks. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing normal market conditions with no significant news, while Dogecoin shows low activity despite a buy signal. Tether remains stable, but its position as a safe haven is challenged by XRP's rise in market capitalization, suggesting a shift in capital flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and increased institutional interest suggest potential for further appreciation. The risk of institutional involvement is noted but outweighed by current momentum.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite a lack of significant news and mixed momentum signals, Ethereum maintains a buy trend, warranting a slight positive allocation due to its fundamental strength.

SOL: +0.1 — While lacking a buy trend signal, Solana's bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity suggest a cautious positive stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite buy signals, low on-chain activity and lack of news keep Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.5 — With a strong market environment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing strong bullish momentum supported by increased institutional interest, though this also introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana exhibit stable technical indicators but lack significant news catalysts. Dogecoin shows some price recovery, but its momentum remains weak. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating shifting dynamics in the stablecoin landscape. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some assets showing potential for upward movement.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin despite potential risks.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are stable, the lack of significant news and mixed momentum suggest a cautious but positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite lacking a buy signal from trend indicators, the consistent bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, the lack of bullish momentum and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally bullish sentiment in the market, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-12-01 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable yet slightly bullish sentiment with the S&P 500 maintaining high levels and low volatility as indicated by the VIX. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with increased institutional interest, although this introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana show mixed signals with no significant news, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable. Tether's position as a stablecoin is challenged by XRP overtaking it in market capitalization, suggesting a potential shift in stablecoin dynamics. Overall, the market sentiment leans towards cautious optimism with a preference for risk assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, make BTC a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the absence of significant news, ETH maintains a buy trend signal, although momentum is lacking. It remains a moderate hold with potential for upside.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish momentum signals and stable on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook, though lacking strong trend confirmation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed technical indicators and no significant news lead to a neutral stance. DOGE remains a hold without clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing a slight preference for risk assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable, especially given the recent market cap shift favoring XRP."
2024-12-01 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing slight upward price movements and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing strong bullish momentum, supported by increased institutional interest, although this also introduces new risks. Ethereum is showing consistent buy signals despite a lack of significant news, indicating stable investor interest. Solana exhibits bullish momentum but lacks a clear buy signal, suggesting a wait-and-see approach. Dogecoin's technical indicators are mixed, with no significant news to drive sentiment. Tether remains stable, but the recent news of XRP surpassing it in market capitalization could influence investor behavior towards stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and increased institutional interest suggest a favorable outlook, despite potential risks.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and stable price movements indicate a moderate positive outlook, even without significant news.

SOL: +0.2 — Bullish momentum is present, but the lack of a clear buy signal suggests a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed technical indicators and no significant news result in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish sentiment in other assets, there is a moderate preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2024-12-01 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context presents a mixed environment for cryptocurrencies. The relatively high 10-Year Treasury Yield and strong U.S. Dollar Index suggest a cautious economic outlook, while the low VIX indicates reduced equity market volatility. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with increased institutional interest, although this introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana exhibit stable technical indicators, with Solana showing bullish momentum. Dogecoin has experienced a significant price increase, suggesting a potential breakout. Tether remains stable, but its position in the market is being challenged by XRP's rise in market capitalization.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong momentum and institutional interest support a positive outlook, although new risks are emerging. The overall bullish sentiment justifies increased allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum maintains a stable technical position with bullish momentum in the latest hour, but lacks significant news catalysts. A slight positive allocation is warranted.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana shows consistent bullish momentum and a recent buy signal, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and breakout potential suggest a strong short-term opportunity, justifying a higher allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive momentum in major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with BTC, ETH, and SOL all demonstrating positive technical indicators, such as short-term moving averages being above long-term ones and bullish momentum signals. Bitcoin, in particular, is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce new risks but also suggests a long-term bullish outlook. DOGE has shown a recent price surge, indicating potential speculative interest, while USDT remains stable as a safe haven amid these dynamics. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a cautious but optimistic approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, supported by institutional interest, suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the lack of significant news, the technical indicators remain positive, warranting a slight increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.4 — Strong technical signals and normal on-chain activity suggest a favorable outlook, justifying a moderate increase.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility, the lack of significant news or strong technical signals suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of risk assets is advisable."
2024-12-01 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by increased institutional interest, although this also introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana maintain a positive technical outlook with consistent buy signals. Dogecoin has shown some volatility but remains within a bullish trend. Tether's position as a stablecoin is stable, but the recent news of XRP surpassing it in market capitalization might influence perceptions of its relative stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite potential risks.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, though lacking significant news, maintain Ethereum's attractiveness in the current market.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and stable on-chain activity support a favorable outlook for Solana, despite the absence of news.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite some recent volatility, Dogecoin's technical indicators remain bullish, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall market showing bullish tendencies, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-12-01 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. economy with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 index. Cryptocurrencies are experiencing bullish technical signals across the board, with all major assets showing buy signals on both trend and momentum indicators. Bitcoin is seeing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility but also suggests confidence in its long-term value. Despite the bullish technical indicators, the news of XRP surpassing Tether in market cap might indicate a shift in market dynamics, potentially affecting stablecoin demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and institutional interest suggest continued upward momentum. However, the risks associated with increased institutional involvement warrant a slightly cautious approach.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are positive, the absence of significant news and a slight dip in momentum suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity support a positive outlook, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, the lack of significant news and mixed on-chain activity suggest maintaining current levels without increasing exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals across other cryptocurrencies and a stable macroeconomic environment, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-12-01 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators such as buy signals from moving averages and bullish momentum from MACD. Bitcoin's increased institutional adoption introduces a layer of risk, but also suggests growing confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum and Solana maintain stable technical signals without significant news, indicating a steady market environment. Dogecoin shows a slight increase in price and activity, but lacks substantial news to drive a strong directional change. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating a shift in market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the risks associated with institutional adoption, Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and on-chain activity suggest a favorable environment for continued growth.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's technical signals remain positive, but the lack of significant news and recent slight price decreases suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's technical indicators are positive, with consistent on-chain activity supporting a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Dogecoin's slight price increase and activity surge suggest some potential for growth, but the absence of significant news limits confidence.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a rationale for reducing stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive momentum signals and buy signals from short-term moving averages. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce new risks but also indicates a growing acceptance of the asset. Ethereum and Solana lack significant news but maintain positive technical indicators. Dogecoin has shown a significant price increase, possibly indicating speculative interest or a breakout. Tether remains stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, suggesting a shift in capital allocation within the stablecoin and broader crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the risks associated with increased institutional involvement, Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's technicals are positive, but the lack of significant news and mixed momentum signals warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's technical indicators are generally positive, with stable on-chain activity, supporting a modest allocation increase.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and bullish momentum signal a potential breakout, making it attractive for short-term gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market showing bullish tendencies, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets is prudent."
2024-12-01 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and buy signals from short-term moving averages. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce new risks but also signals confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum and Solana have no significant news, but technical indicators suggest a stable environment. Dogecoin has shown significant price volatility, with a recent price decrease after a notable increase. Tether remains stable, but its position as a top stablecoin is challenged by XRP's rise in market capitalization. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a neutral to slightly bullish backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, coupled with institutional interest, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite potential risks.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are stable, the lack of significant news and mixed momentum signals suggest a cautious but slightly positive stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the absence of a buy signal from moving averages, bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent volatility and a bullish momentum signal suggest potential for short-term gains, but caution is warranted due to price fluctuations.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of bullish momentum, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-12-01 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with low volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500, which could support risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest, which could introduce both opportunities and risks. The cryptocurrency market shows mixed technical signals, with Bitcoin and Dogecoin displaying bullish momentum, while Ethereum and Solana show less clear signals. The news of XRP surpassing Tether in market capitalization highlights shifts in the stablecoin landscape, potentially affecting USDT's role in portfolios.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and bullish technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite potential risks from rapid price appreciation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a consistent buy signal from trend indicators, the lack of bullish momentum and absence of significant news keeps Ethereum in a neutral position.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish momentum continues, but the lack of a buy signal from trend indicators tempers enthusiasm. No significant news to drive sentiment.

DOGE: +0.5 — Strong bullish momentum and recent price increases suggest a favorable short-term outlook, despite the absence of significant news.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish market sentiment, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets."

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum, despite leading crypto fund inflows, is experiencing short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price drops. Solana faces technical challenges with a recent supply chain attack but is expected to stabilize within a defined price range. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends with potential for a significant rally, while Tether remains stable without significant news, indicating a steady risk-off option.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and positive technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor interest, justifying a cautious positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges and lack of strong buy signals suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a significant rally make Dogecoin relatively attractive, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by continued institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum, despite leading crypto fund inflows, has experienced some short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price declines. Solana faces some headwinds due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is exhibiting bullish momentum with potential for a 'Santa Rally,' though it remains volatile. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable S&P 500 and low volatility index, suggest a relatively stable risk environment, which may support continued interest in risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF-related news provide a bullish backdrop. On-chain activity and technical indicators also support upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor interest, suggesting potential for recovery.

SOL: 0.0 — While there is some bullish momentum, the recent security concerns and lack of a clear trend signal suggest a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a 'Santa Rally' indicate positive sentiment, though the asset remains volatile.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2024-12-02 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Dogecoin showing strong bullish momentum supported by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin's price is buoyed by significant institutional buying and new financial products, while Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend with potential for further gains. Ethereum, despite leading fund inflows, is facing mixed sentiment due to recent price declines and momentum loss. Solana is under pressure from a security incident but is expected to stabilize within a defined price range. The macroeconomic context, with relatively low volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a moderate risk environment, favoring risk-on assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and new ETF options provide a bullish backdrop. Positive technical signals and on-chain activity further support an increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence. However, mixed technical signals warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — Security concerns and lack of clear bullish signals suggest maintaining current exposure. Expected price stabilization provides no immediate catalyst for change.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a 'Santa Rally' support an increased allocation. However, volatility requires careful monitoring.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely. Current market conditions favor reallocating some USDT into more volatile assets."
2024-12-02 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish signals for assets like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, while others like Ethereum and Solana show signs of volatility and potential bearishness. Bitcoin is benefiting from positive news, such as MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could drive further institutional interest. Ethereum, despite leading fund inflows, faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price drops. Solana is dealing with security concerns from a supply chain attack, which may dampen investor confidence. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" while USDT remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news, such as MicroStrategy's accumulation and ETF options launch, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite strong fund inflows, recent price drops and mixed technical signals suggest caution. However, the overall investor interest remains supportive.

SOL: -0.3 — Security concerns from the supply chain attack and recent price breakdowns indicate potential downside risk, warranting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" make Dogecoin attractive, despite recent volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-12-02 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of strong investor interest and positive developments. Bitcoin's market is buoyed by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, suggesting institutional confidence. Ethereum sees significant fund inflows, although recent price momentum has been mixed. Solana faces technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend, with potential for a ""Santa Rally"" as analysts anticipate a significant price increase. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT may see reduced demand as investors seek higher returns from other assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news from institutional adoption and ETF options, coupled with strong technical signals, suggest a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Technical issues and a recent downtrend suggest caution, though long-term stabilization is expected.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment and potential for a significant price rally make it attractive for short-term gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index. Bitcoin has shown mixed signals with recent price declines but positive news from institutional interest and ETF developments. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, though recent price momentum has been negative. Solana is facing technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, positive institutional news and ETF developments suggest potential for recovery. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, but recent price declines warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: -0.3 — Technical issues and recent price breakdowns suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a rally and recent price increases suggest moderate upside, but volatility remains high.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the potential for positive movements in other assets, reduce stablecoin exposure to capitalize on risk-on sentiment."
2024-12-02 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing some positive sentiment due to continued institutional interest and new financial instruments, such as the Cboe Bitcoin ETF options, despite recent price fluctuations. Ethereum is seeing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, but faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price declines. Solana is dealing with security concerns from a supply chain attack, which may impact developer confidence, although analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of potential bullish momentum, with analysts predicting a possible 'Santa Rally'. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a potential safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and new ETF options provide a supportive backdrop, but recent price volatility suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate positive long-term sentiment, but recent price declines warrant a moderate allocation increase.

SOL: -0.2 — Security concerns from the supply chain attack and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure slightly.

DOGE: +0.6 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and bullish momentum signals make DOGE an attractive short-term play.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintain current exposure as a hedge against market volatility, with no significant news to alter its stability."
2024-12-02 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a cautiously optimistic risk sentiment. Bitcoin's recent news highlights continued institutional interest, potentially supporting its price, while Ethereum sees strong fund inflows despite recent price declines. Solana faces technical challenges but is expected to stabilize, and Dogecoin shows potential for a short-term rally. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some assets showing potential for growth amid mixed technical signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and ETF-related developments provide a strong foundation for potential growth, despite mixed technical signals.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, though recent price declines suggest caution.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges and a lack of clear bullish signals suggest a neutral stance, awaiting further stabilization.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a short-term rally and bullish sentiment, though recent volatility warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the cautiously optimistic market sentiment, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential growth in other assets."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's continued accumulation by MicroStrategy and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options are positive developments, yet the price remains under pressure, possibly due to broader market conditions. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, but recent price drops suggest short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces technical vulnerabilities, which could weigh on its price despite forecasts of stabilization. Dogecoin has seen significant price volatility, with potential for a bullish rally. In this environment, USDT remains a safe haven, reflecting cautious investor sentiment amid market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, positive news such as MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of ETF options provide support. The market may stabilize or recover, making BTC relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor interest, but recent price declines suggest caution. The potential for recovery exists if bearish momentum subsides.

SOL: -0.1 — Technical vulnerabilities and recent price declines create uncertainty. However, forecasts of price stabilization suggest a cautious hold rather than a strong sell.

DOGE: 0.0 — Significant price volatility and mixed sentiment, with potential for a bullish rally. Current conditions warrant a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and slight bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher USDT allocation as a safe haven is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen continued institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase and the launch of new ETF options, though its technical indicators remain bearish. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor confidence, but recent price declines suggest short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of potential bullish momentum, with analysts predicting a possible rally. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bearish technical indicators, strong institutional interest and new ETF options create a positive outlook for Bitcoin. This supports a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.1 — Strong fund inflows are a positive sign, but recent price declines and bearish technicals warrant a cautious approach. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: 0.0 — The supply chain attack introduces uncertainty, offsetting potential price stabilization. A neutral stance is appropriate until further clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.5 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and bullish momentum suggests a moderate increase in allocation, despite recent volatility.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for bullish momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on riskier assets."
2024-12-02 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously bearish with a mix of negative technical indicators and some positive news developments. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight downturn in price and on-chain activity despite positive news about MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum shows strong investor interest with significant fund inflows, but recent price drops indicate short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization within a certain range. Dogecoin is volatile, with potential for a bullish rally, though recent price decreases suggest caution. The macroeconomic environment, with relatively high interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, adds to the cautious sentiment, making USDT a relatively safer asset in this context.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite technical weakness, positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF developments provide a supportive backdrop for potential recovery.

ETH: 0.0 — Strong fund inflows are offset by recent price declines and bearish momentum, suggesting a neutral stance is appropriate.

SOL: -0.2 — Technical indicators are weak, and the recent security risk adds uncertainty, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and recent analyst optimism suggest a cautious increase in allocation, despite recent price volatility.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the overall bearish sentiment and technical weakness across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent for risk management."
2024-12-02 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. dollar and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a relatively calm market backdrop. However, the recent market data for cryptocurrencies indicates a bearish sentiment with most assets experiencing slight to significant price decreases over the past hours. Technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD signals are not showing bullish signs, and on-chain activity is generally low. News highlights include MicroStrategy's continued BTC accumulation and significant inflows into ETH funds, indicating some institutional interest despite the bearish short-term sentiment. Solana faces technical challenges with a supply chain attack, while Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with potential for a short-term rally.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite bearish technicals, the continued accumulation by MicroStrategy and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options provide a supportive backdrop for BTC, suggesting potential for upward movement.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate institutional interest, which could counteract the recent price drop and momentum loss, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent supply chain attack introduces uncertainty, and while price stabilization is expected, the technical risks warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, the potential for a 'Santa Rally' and bullish analyst sentiment could lead to short-term gains, justifying a slight positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent, but the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-12-02 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable yet cautious outlook, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. dollar index. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum is seeing strong fund inflows despite recent price declines, suggesting underlying investor confidence. Solana faces technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but price forecasts remain stable. Dogecoin shows potential for a bullish rally, driven by speculative interest and recent price increases. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional buying and ETF developments provide strong support for Bitcoin, despite technical indicators not yet signaling a buy.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price drops, substantial fund inflows indicate strong investor interest, suggesting potential for recovery.

SOL: 0.0 — While price forecasts are stable, the recent security issue with the Solana library introduces uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest and potential for a 'Santa Rally' provide a moderate positive outlook, despite inherent volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified."
2024-12-02 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed sentiment across the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing positive news with MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, suggesting institutional interest. Ethereum sees strong fund inflows, indicating investor confidence, but recent price declines highlight short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces technical challenges with a recent supply chain attack, but analysts predict price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of bullish momentum with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" though it remains volatile. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility in traditional markets and no significant changes in major indices, which could support a cautious risk-on approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive institutional developments and ETF options support a bullish outlook, despite neutral technical indicators. 

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, though recent price declines warrant caution.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite potential price stabilization, the recent security issue introduces uncertainty, balancing the outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish news and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for upward movement, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive sentiment in risk assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-12-02 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price is showing signs of bullish momentum, supported by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, which could enhance institutional interest. Ethereum, despite recent price drops, is experiencing significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest. Solana is facing some technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization within a defined range. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend, with analysts anticipating a potential 'Santa Rally.' The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and no significant shifts in traditional markets, suggesting a neutral backdrop for crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF options, suggesting increased institutional interest and potential for price appreciation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price drops, significant fund inflows indicate strong investor interest, supporting a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with technical challenges from a supply chain attack, but price stabilization is expected, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.6 — Volatile uptrend and potential for a 'Santa Rally' suggest bullish sentiment, making it relatively attractive for short-term gains.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with growth potential."
2024-12-02 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price drop, strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, warranting a slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical issues and mixed price signals suggest a cautious approach, with no clear direction for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Volatile uptrend and potential for a 'Santa Rally' suggest a moderate positive outlook, supported by high transaction activity.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified."
2024-12-02 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some bullish developments tempered by recent price declines. Bitcoin is seeing strong institutional interest, highlighted by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum is experiencing significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price declines suggest short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing volatile behavior, with potential for a bullish rally. In this environment, USDT remains a safe haven amid uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and new ETF options provide a bullish outlook, despite recent price volatility. This supports a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Strong fund inflows suggest positive long-term sentiment, but recent price declines warrant caution. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite potential price stabilization, the recent security issue poses risks. Maintain current exposure until further clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.3 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and recent volatile uptrend justify a cautious increase in allocation, despite the absence of strong technical signals.

USDT: -0.4 — With mixed market signals and some bullish developments, a slight reduction in USDT is appropriate to capitalize on potential opportunities in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context presents a mixed backdrop for cryptocurrencies, with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility as indicated by the VIX. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, supported by recent significant purchases by MicroStrategy and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options by Cboe. Ethereum, despite leading in fund inflows, is facing short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price declines. Solana is stabilizing after a security scare, with analysts expecting price consolidation. Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential rally, driven by speculative interest and a volatile uptrend. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive momentum and strong institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence, warranting a cautious but positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — While price stabilization is expected, recent security concerns may limit immediate upside, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Speculative interest and potential for a 'Santa Rally' suggest a moderate increase in allocation, despite recent volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets is likely, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-12-02 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish inclination. Bitcoin has seen significant institutional interest with MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide a supportive backdrop despite recent price declines. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor confidence, but recent price drops suggest short-term bearish momentum. Solana faces security concerns due to a supply chain attack, yet analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of potential bullish momentum with a possible ""Santa Rally,"" though it remains volatile. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a cautious risk-on sentiment, but the high U.S. dollar index could weigh on crypto prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Institutional interest and ETF developments are positive, but recent price declines suggest caution. Overall, BTC remains attractive due to long-term bullish signals.

**ETH: +0.2** — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, but recent price drops and bearish momentum suggest a cautious approach. A slight positive allocation is warranted.

**SOL: 0.0** — Security concerns from the supply chain attack offset potential price stabilization. Neutral stance due to mixed signals.

**DOGE: +0.3** — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and bullish sentiment provide a positive outlook, though volatility remains a concern. Moderate allocation increase is justified.

**USDT: -0.3** — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for bullish moves in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-12-02 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish signals emerging amidst overall cautiousness. Bitcoin sees positive news with MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, suggesting institutional interest. Ethereum, despite recent inflows into funds, faces short-term bearish momentum. Solana is dealing with a security issue but is expected to stabilize within a defined price range. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends with potential for a 'Santa Rally.' The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility in the S&P 500 and a strong U.S. dollar, which could influence crypto market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive institutional news and ETF developments provide a bullish outlook, despite mixed technical indicators.

ETH: +0.2 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor interest, but recent price decline tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: 0.0 — Security concerns offset potential price stabilization, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and recent bullish momentum suggest moderate upside potential.

USDT: -0.4 — With some positive sentiment in risk assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-12-02 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's continued accumulation by MicroStrategy and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options are positive indicators, potentially driving demand and institutional interest. Ethereum, despite recent price declines, is seeing significant fund inflows, suggesting strong investor interest. Solana faces some technical challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends with potential for a 'Santa Rally,' while USDT remains stable without significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.6** — The combination of strong institutional buying and the introduction of ETF options provides a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, despite mixed technical indicators.

**ETH: +0.3** — While technical indicators are mixed, the substantial inflows into ETH funds reflect strong investor interest, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

**SOL: 0.0** — Despite some technical issues, Solana's price is expected to stabilize. The lack of strong bullish or bearish signals suggests a neutral stance.

**DOGE: +0.2** — The potential for a 'Santa Rally' and recent bullish momentum provide a slight positive bias, though volatility remains a concern.

**USDT: -0.5** — Given the positive sentiment and potential for gains in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT aligns with a risk-on approach."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable backdrop with moderate volatility (VIX at 13.34) and a strong S&P 500 index. Bitcoin continues to see institutional interest with MicroStrategy's significant purchase and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, indicating a supportive environment for BTC. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, although recent price momentum has been bearish. Solana faces technical challenges with a compromised npm package, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin shows potential for a bullish rally, driven by positive analyst sentiment. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional interest and new ETF options are strong bullish signals, despite mixed technicals. The macro environment supports risk assets, making BTC attractive.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows suggest investor confidence, though recent price weakness tempers enthusiasm. Overall, ETH remains a solid hold with potential upside.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a compromised npm package, price stabilization is expected. The technical issue introduces uncertainty, balancing out potential gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment and potential for a 'Santa Rally' make DOGE appealing, though its inherent volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely."
2024-12-02 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.
