2024-11-26 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection. Analysts are cautious about further declines, especially with a potential dip below $90K. Ethereum, however, shows some bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a major sell-off, while Dogecoin's launch of a new ETP in the Nordics has not offset its recent price drop. The macroeconomic context, with a high U.S. Dollar Index and stable S&P 500, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stable assets like USDT amidst high volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent significant price drop and potential further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not favorable for new allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price decreases, strong open interest and bullish sentiment in derivatives support a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: -0.1 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure. No current holdings to reduce, but cautious on new allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent ETP launch, the price drop and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent for capital preservation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with recent volatility and profit-taking affecting major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, with analysts suggesting potential further downside due to weakening demand. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity, although its price movements have been relatively stable. Solana has faced a notable decline due to a major sell-off, raising bearish concerns. Dogecoin, despite a sharp drop, has seen some bullish sentiment due to new financial products and perceived buying opportunities. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not a priority for new allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong open interest in derivatives and stable price movements indicate bullish sentiment and potential for growth. Current holdings should be maintained or slightly increased.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent price decline and bearish pressure from large sell-offs suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction needed, but not attractive for new allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price drop, new financial products and perceived buying opportunities suggest potential for recovery. Worth considering for small allocation.

USDT: +0.5 — Given current market volatility and potential downside in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher stablecoin exposure is prudent for risk management."
2024-11-26 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a period of volatility and mixed sentiment. Bitcoin has recently pulled back after approaching the $100K milestone, with analysts cautioning about potential further declines due to profit-taking and weakening demand. Ethereum, on the other hand, is showing signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and an increase in USDT supply on its network. Solana is facing bearish pressure following a significant price drop and a large whale sell-off. Dogecoin has also seen a price decline, but the launch of a new ETP in the Nordics could provide some positive sentiment. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings allow for a neutral to slightly negative stance.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment from record derivatives open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a positive outlook. Current holdings justify increasing exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent price drop and whale sell-off, the lack of current holdings and potential for stabilization at key support levels suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — The launch of the DOGE ETP could provide some positive momentum, and current holdings justify maintaining exposure with a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable. Current holdings allow for a reduction."
2024-11-26 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Bitcoin's recent near-$100K milestone was met with profit-taking and a subsequent drop, indicating potential short-term bearish pressure. Ethereum shows strong bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, suggesting increased trader activity and confidence. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off and broader market correction, while Dogecoin's recent ETP launch in the Nordics provides a positive development despite its price drop. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and profit-taking indicate bearish sentiment, and potential further downside is suggested by analysts. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong bullish sentiment with record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum, indicating positive momentum and trader confidence.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop and whale sell-off, the lack of current holdings means no immediate action is necessary. Monitoring for potential support at $200.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the price drop, the launch of a DOGE ETP provides a positive long-term outlook. Current holdings are maintained without change.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential downside in other assets, maintaining some exposure to USDT as a safe haven is prudent."
2024-11-26 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is mixed with a bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, with analysts warning of further downside potential due to profit-taking and weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with a record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity. Solana has faced a notable decline amid broader market corrections and a significant whale sell-off, adding to bearish pressure. Dogecoin has also seen a sharp drop, though some traders view this as a buying opportunity. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, but the high U.S. dollar index suggests potential pressure on crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and bearish news suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction possible, but not favorable for allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price decreases, the record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate potential bullish sentiment. Current holdings justify a slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off create uncertainty. No current holdings, so neutral stance maintained.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the price drop, the launch of a DOGE ETP and some bullish sentiment among traders suggest a hold position. Current holdings justify maintaining exposure without increasing.

USDT: +0.5 — In a mixed market with bearish tendencies, maintaining liquidity in USDT is prudent to capitalize on future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin's recent drop after approaching the $100K mark has led to increased profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K, indicating a weakening demand in the U.S. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and a surge in USDT supply on its network. Solana has experienced a significant price drop due to a major sell-off, raising concerns about its short-term support levels. Dogecoin, despite a sharp decline, maintains some bullish sentiment due to new financial products and perceived buying opportunities. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a high U.S. dollar index, suggests a mixed backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside amid profit-taking and weakening demand suggest caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from record derivatives activity and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Significant price drop and bearish pressure from whale sell-off warrant a neutral stance until clearer support levels are established.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price decline, the launch of a new ETP and continued bullish sentiment among traders provide a modest positive signal.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential for further downside in risk assets, maintaining liquidity in USDT is advisable."
2024-11-26 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns about weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum, however, shows some bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although its price remains under pressure. Solana has seen a notable decline due to a major sell-off by a whale, adding to the bearish sentiment. Dogecoin, despite a sharp price drop, has some positive sentiment due to the launch of a new ETP, indicating potential buying interest. The macroeconomic context, with a high U.S. dollar index and stable gold prices, suggests a cautious market environment, favoring stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. Lack of current holdings allows for a negative score to reflect bearish sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price pressure, record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate underlying bullish sentiment.

SOL: 0.0 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off create uncertainty. Monitoring for stabilization before considering allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Despite a price drop, the launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment among traders suggest potential for a rebound.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining liquidity in USDT is prudent, providing flexibility to capitalize on future opportunities."
2024-11-26 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent drop after approaching the $100K mark indicates profit-taking and a potential weakening in demand, with analysts suggesting further downside risk. Ethereum, despite a record in derivatives open interest, has seen price declines, though it remains a key network for USDT. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale, and Dogecoin, despite launching a new ETP, has also seen a sharp price drop. In this environment, USDT's stability and bullish technical signals suggest a preference for safety amid broader market weakness.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price declines and bearish news suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but the sentiment is negative.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with high open interest but recent price declines. Holding current position without increasing exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Significant price drop and bearish pressure from whale activity. No current holdings, so no reduction needed, but not attractive for new allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite bullish sentiment from the ETP launch, the significant price drop and low on-chain activity suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly.

USDT: +0.7 — Stablecoin with bullish technical signals and no significant negative news. Preferable in a cautious market environment for capital preservation."
2024-11-26 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop from near $100K has triggered profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, with analysts warning of further potential declines below $90K. Ethereum, despite a record open interest in derivatives, is experiencing a price decline, possibly due to broader market corrections. Solana is facing bearish pressure from a major sell-off, and Dogecoin has seen a sharp drop, although some traders remain optimistic. In contrast, USDT remains stable, and its increasing supply on the Ethereum network indicates a preference for stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent sharp decline and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings allow for a negative score.

ETH: -0.1 — While derivatives activity is high, the price is under pressure, and technical indicators are not supportive of a strong buy. Current holdings justify a cautious reduction.

SOL: +0.1 — Although facing bearish pressure, the recent sell-off may present a buying opportunity, especially if it stabilizes around key support levels.

DOGE: -0.2 — Significant price drop and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure, despite some trader optimism.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious, with recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K suggests profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, with analysts warning of potential further declines. Ethereum shows mixed signals with record-high open interest indicating bullish sentiment, yet its price remains under pressure. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced significant price drops, with Solana facing bearish pressure from a major sell-off and Dogecoin traders viewing the dip as a potential buying opportunity. USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and warnings of further downside suggest caution. Without current holdings, no reduction is possible, but the sentiment is bearish.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite price pressure, record-high open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate underlying bullish sentiment.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drop and bearish pressure from a large sell-off suggest reducing exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite a sharp drop, some traders see a buying opportunity, but the overall sentiment remains cautious.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of market volatility and potential further declines in other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation for stability is prudent."
2024-11-26 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop after approaching the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential weakening in U.S. demand. Ethereum, while facing a price decline, shows signs of bullish sentiment in the derivatives market, with record open interest and increased USDT supply on its network. Solana and Dogecoin have both seen sharp declines, with Solana facing additional bearish pressure from a large whale sell-off. Despite the downturn, some traders view Dogecoin's drop as a buying opportunity. In this environment, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the significant price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing price pressure, the record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate underlying bullish sentiment, warranting a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.5 — The significant price drop and whale sell-off create a bearish outlook, suggesting a reduction in exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite some traders viewing the drop as a buying opportunity, the lack of strong bullish signals and significant price decline suggest a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2024-11-26 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop after approaching the $100K mark highlights profit-taking and potential downside risks, with analysts suggesting further declines. Ethereum, despite a record in derivatives open interest, remains under pressure, possibly indicating speculative positioning rather than fundamental strength. Solana and Dogecoin have both experienced significant price drops, with Solana facing additional bearish pressure from a large whale sell-off. Meanwhile, Dogecoin's launch of an ETP in the Nordics is a positive development, but it hasn't offset the broader market weakness. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent declines and warnings of further downside, Bitcoin's historical resilience and potential for a rebound warrant a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: +0.1 — The record open interest in ETH derivatives suggests increased trader activity, but the lack of a bullish price signal tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and bearish sentiment from whale activity suggest reducing exposure to mitigate potential further losses.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite the launch of a new ETP, the sharp price decline and lack of immediate bullish catalysts suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of current market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2024-11-26 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market is experiencing a bearish sentiment, with significant price declines observed across major assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K, coupled with warnings of further downside, indicates a cautious market environment. Ethereum's record open interest suggests some bullish sentiment, although price action remains subdued. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a significant whale sell-off, while Dogecoin's launch of a new ETP has not prevented its price from falling sharply. In this context, USDT remains stable, reflecting a potential flight to safety as investors seek to preserve capital amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price declines and warnings of further downside suggest reducing exposure, especially given the current bearish sentiment and profit-taking behavior.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the bearish market, the record open interest in ETH derivatives indicates some underlying bullish sentiment, warranting a cautious hold with a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.3 — The significant price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure, suggesting a reduction in exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although the launch of a new ETP is positive, the sharp price decline and mixed sentiment justify a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk effectively."
2024-11-26 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Bitcoin recently experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum, on the other hand, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although its price has been relatively stable. Solana has faced bearish pressure due to a major sell-off and broader market correction, while Dogecoin's recent price drop is seen as a buying opportunity by some traders. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a mixed outlook for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside, as indicated by news and technical signals, suggest caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment in derivatives and stable price action make ETH relatively attractive in the current environment.

SOL: -0.5 — Recent sell-off and bearish sentiment from whale activity suggest reducing exposure, especially given weak ecosystem performance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price drop, the launch of a DOGE ETP and bullish trader sentiment provide a modest positive outlook.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential for further volatility, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2024-11-26 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of profit-taking and bearish pressure across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment in the derivatives market, but its price has seen a recent decline. Solana faces bearish pressure from a major sell-off and broader market correction. Dogecoin has seen a sharp price drop, yet some traders remain optimistic due to new financial products like the ETP launch. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest reducing exposure. The market sentiment is cautious with analysts predicting a possible dip below $90K.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the recent price decrease, the record open interest in derivatives indicates bullish sentiment, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — The significant price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure, warranting a reduction in exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop, the launch of the DOGE ETP and some bullish sentiment among traders suggest holding the current position without changes.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a stable hedge against market volatility."
2024-11-26 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the significant drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. Current holdings should be reduced slightly to manage risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong derivatives activity and positive sentiment around USDT supply on Ethereum indicate potential upside, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent to mitigate potential losses.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with the ETP launch and recent price drop. Current allocation should be maintained as the market digests these developments.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the market's mixed sentiment and recent volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against potential downside in riskier assets."
2024-11-26 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with significant volatility and recent price corrections across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin recently experienced a sharp drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns about weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although its price has been volatile. Solana is under pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale, while Dogecoin's recent price drop is seen by some as a buying opportunity. In this environment, the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, and the S&P 500 is relatively stable, suggesting a cautious macroeconomic backdrop.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside due to profit-taking and weakening demand suggest caution. Maintain a reduced exposure to manage risk.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, strong derivatives activity and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate bullish sentiment. Increase exposure moderately.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant sell-off and weak ecosystem performance create bearish pressure. Reduce exposure slightly to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, some traders view it as a buying opportunity. Maintain current exposure as sentiment is mixed.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market volatility and potential downside risks, a higher allocation to USDT provides a hedge and liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin experienced a notable drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K as suggested by analysts. Ethereum's derivatives market shows bullish sentiment with record open interest, yet its price has also decreased. Solana and Dogecoin have faced significant sell-offs, with Solana's ecosystem performance under scrutiny and a major whale sell-off adding to the bearish pressure. Despite the market downturn, some traders view Dogecoin's drop as a buying opportunity. USDT remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.1 — Record open interest and rising USDT supply on Ethereum are positive, but recent price declines warrant a cautious approach. Maintain current exposure with a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.5 — The significant price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish sentiment. Reduce exposure, considering the weak ecosystem performance and market correction.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite the launch of the first DOGE ETP, the sharp price decline and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure slightly.

USDT: +0.7 — In light of the bearish market conditions, increasing USDT exposure provides a safe haven and capital preservation opportunity."
2024-11-26 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening demand. Ethereum shows mixed signals, with a record in derivatives open interest suggesting bullish sentiment, but price movements remain subdued. Solana and Dogecoin have both experienced notable declines, with Solana facing additional pressure from a whale sell-off. Despite Dogecoin's drop, some traders remain optimistic due to increased accessibility through new financial products. In this environment, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid the market's volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the significant price drop and potential for further downside warrant caution. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.3 — The record open interest in derivatives suggests underlying bullish sentiment, although price action remains mixed. A moderate increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: -0.3 — The recent price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market conditions.

DOGE: -0.1 — While there is some optimism due to new financial products, the recent price drop and low on-chain activity suggest maintaining a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market sentiment across other assets, increasing USDT holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-11-26 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's failure to maintain levels near $100K has led to increased profit-taking and concerns about further downside, especially with a potential dip below $90K. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment in the derivatives market, but its price remains volatile. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a significant whale sell-off, while Dogecoin's recent ETP launch in the Nordics has not prevented its price from dropping, although some traders remain optimistic. Tether remains stable with no significant news, but its role as a safe haven could become more prominent if bearish trends persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price declines and warnings of further downside suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite price volatility, the record open interest in derivatives indicates potential bullish sentiment, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — The large sell-off by a whale and the broader market correction suggest reducing exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent price drop and some bullish sentiment from the ETP launch; maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT for stability and as a hedge against further market declines."
2024-11-26 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and SOL. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K and the potential for further downside indicate a cautious environment, especially with analysts warning of weakening demand. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, suggesting increased trader activity.

BTC: -0.5 — The recent price drop and potential for further downside, as indicated by analysts, suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the bearish market, Ethereum's record open interest and strong USDT supply signal potential bullish sentiment, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — The significant price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure, suggesting a reduction in exposure to avoid potential further losses.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent price drop but some bullish sentiment due to new ETPs; maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and potential for further downside in other assets, increasing USDT allocation provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant pullback after nearing the $100K mark, indicating profit-taking and potential further downside risk. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, suggesting increased trader activity. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a major sell-off and a broader market correction, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp drop, sees some traders viewing it as a buying opportunity. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and no significant changes in major indices, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside as indicated by analyst warnings and profit-taking behavior suggest reducing exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a positive outlook.

SOL: -0.2 — Bearish pressure from a major sell-off and weak ecosystem performance warrant caution and a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price drop, the launch of a DOGE ETP and some traders viewing it as a buying opportunity provide a moderately positive outlook.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of potential market volatility and bearish signals in other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation for risk management is prudent."
2024-11-26 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, indicating potential profit-taking and a shift towards downside protection. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, suggesting increased trader activity, while Solana and Dogecoin face bearish pressures due to broader market corrections and significant sell-offs. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a mixed environment where risk assets might face headwinds, but opportunities remain for selective exposure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and potential further downside as indicated by analysts suggest reducing exposure to manage risk.

ETH: +0.6 — Record open interest and regained top spot for USDT indicate strong bullish sentiment, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent price drop and significant whale sell-off create bearish pressure, suggesting caution and reduced exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, the launch of a DOGE ETP and continued bullish sentiment among traders provide a moderate buy signal.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of market volatility and potential downside risks, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation for capital preservation is prudent."
2024-11-27 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This rebound, coupled with a significant $15 trillion Bitcoin bet, has helped stabilize the market after a substantial sell-off. Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum with record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity, reflecting growing market confidence. Solana is experiencing a rally supported by high DEX volumes, surpassing Ethereum's, and is eyeing a new high of $300. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level at $0.40, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, USDT maintains its dominance in the stablecoin market despite the retirement of its euro stablecoin, EURt.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The strong rebound and stabilization efforts, along with renewed bullish sentiment, suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased activity signal strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's rally, supported by high DEX volumes and positive on-chain data, indicates strong upward momentum, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite testing a key resistance level, the mixed signals and lack of clear directional momentum suggest a neutral stance for now.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullish sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This recovery has helped stabilize the broader crypto market after a significant sell-off. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased network activity. Solana continues to show strength, with its price rallying and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surpassing Ethereum's, indicating robust on-chain activity. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains a dominant force in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin, EURt.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and the stabilization of the market after a significant sell-off indicate strong upward momentum. The news of a massive BTC position further supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong bullish momentum, as indicated by record futures open interest and increased activity, suggests a favorable environment for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's price rally and significant DEX volume highlight its growing market presence and potential for continued upward movement.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, its market cap growth and speculative interest provide a modestly positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, there is no immediate need to allocate capital to USDT."
2024-11-27 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong market confidence. Solana continues to gain traction with its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum, signaling robust on-chain activity. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by speculative interest. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its dominance in the stablecoin market reinforced by a recent supply increase.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with significant on-chain activity, suggest a positive outlook. The recent stabilization after a sell-off further supports this view.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market confidence indicate a bullish trend. The asset's strong momentum and activity support a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's continued rally, supported by strong on-chain and derivatives data, along with surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, makes it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the market cap boost and speculative interest provide a moderate positive signal. However, caution is advised due to potential volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the stablecoin's role as a safe haven, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the current risk appetite in the market."
2024-11-27 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding towards the $100K mark after a recent dip, supported by substantial market interventions. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures activity, indicating strong investor confidence and bullish momentum. Solana continues to perform well, with its decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surpassing Ethereum's, highlighting its growing prominence in the crypto space. Dogecoin is testing a critical resistance level, driven by speculative interest and market cap growth. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its dominance in the stablecoin market reinforced despite regulatory shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and strong market support suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.9 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and bullish price action indicate strong investor confidence and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's impressive DEX volume and price rally position it as a strong contender for capital allocation in a bullish market environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — While speculative interest is high, DOGE is approaching key resistance, warranting a cautious but positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate as capital rotates into more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's robust on-chain activity and positive price momentum, coupled with high DEX volumes, make it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite testing key resistance levels, Dogecoin's speculative nature and mixed signals suggest a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across other crypto assets, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of growth opportunities is advisable."
2024-11-27 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, and Ethereum is experiencing record futures open interest, indicating strong bullish momentum. Solana is also performing well, hitting new highs and seeing substantial DEX volume, surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels with strong market cap growth, partly driven by speculation. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with its dominance in the stablecoin market reinforced despite the retirement of its euro stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with a significant rebound and renewed market confidence. Positive news and technical indicators suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum with record futures interest and increased on-chain activity, indicating growing market confidence and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is benefiting from strong on-chain and derivatives data, with a significant rally and high DEX volume, suggesting continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin is approaching a key resistance level with strong market cap growth and positive sentiment, driven by speculation and media attention.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT remains dominant in the stablecoin market, the current bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies suggests a neutral stance as capital rotates into riskier assets."
2024-11-27 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is rebounding strongly, nearing the $100K mark, supported by a substantial market stabilization effort after a recent sell-off. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong bullish sentiment and renewed market confidence. Solana is also gaining traction, reaching new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, driven by increased memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by speculation and market cap growth. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable but is seeing increased supply dominance in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong rebound and bullish sentiment with significant market support. Positive news about market stabilization and nearing $100K adds confidence.

ETH: +0.7 — Record futures open interest and increased market activity signal strong bullish momentum and growing investor confidence.

SOL: +0.6 — New highs and strong on-chain and derivatives support, coupled with surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, indicate robust growth potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with positive market cap news and speculation support. However, the potential for reversal warrants cautious optimism.

USDT: 0.0 — No current holdings and stablecoin dominance remains, but no significant signals to increase exposure in a bullish market environment."
2024-11-27 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with strong upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has rebounded significantly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong market confidence and bullish momentum. Solana continues to perform well, hitting new highs and showing strong support from on-chain and derivatives data. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap growth driven by speculation and external influences. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there is a shift in focus due to regulatory changes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with significant market support, make it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and strong market confidence suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new highs and strong on-chain and derivatives support indicate continued positive momentum, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, its market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderate bullish outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite its dominance in the stablecoin market, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining a neutral position in USDT."
2024-11-27 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is also experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels, indicating growing market confidence. Solana continues to perform well, with strong support from on-chain and derivatives data, and its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, with its supply increasing despite the retirement of its euro stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with significant market stabilization efforts, suggest a positive outlook. The asset is well-positioned for further gains.

ETH: +0.9 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market activity indicate strong bullish momentum. The asset is highly attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's continued rally and impressive DEX volume highlight its strong market position, making it a favorable asset to increase exposure to.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, its market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderately positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bullish market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as capital rotates into riskier assets."
2024-11-27 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip and nearing the $100K mark, supported by a significant $15T position stabilizing the market. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong bullish momentum and increased market confidence. Solana continues its upward trajectory, driven by robust on-chain and derivatives data, and has surpassed Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with its market cap boosted by speculation and high-profile endorsements. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there is a shift in focus due to regulatory changes in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with a significant rebound and supportive macroeconomic news. The recent stabilization after a sell-off suggests a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market activity indicate strong bullish sentiment, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive price action, coupled with high DEX volume and strong on-chain support, suggests continued upward potential, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, the recent market cap boost and speculative interest provide a moderately positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With the current bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as it serves as a hedge against potential market volatility."
2024-11-27 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong market confidence and optimism. Solana continues to rally, supported by robust on-chain and derivatives data, and is eyeing new highs. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, driven by speculation and notable market cap growth. Meanwhile, stablecoins, particularly USDT, maintain their dominance, although the market is showing signs of capital rotation into riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with supportive news of a massive position stabilizing the market, make it an attractive asset for allocation.

ETH: +0.9 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market activity reflect strong bullish momentum, making it highly attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's price rally and significant DEX volume, along with positive on-chain data, suggest continued upward potential, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, the positive market cap news and speculation provide some upward potential, though with caution.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite its dominance in the stablecoin market, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests a neutral stance on USDT, with no immediate need for allocation."
2024-11-27 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a bullish sentiment, with Bitcoin rebounding towards the $100K mark after a significant dip, supported by a large position stabilizing the market. Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting a record high, indicating growing market confidence.

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with renewed bullish sentiment and significant market stabilization efforts. The potential for reaching $100K again makes it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is supported by record futures open interest and increased market confidence. The positive sentiment and strong technical indicators justify a favorable allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's breakout and strong on-chain and derivatives data, along with surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, indicate robust growth potential, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite testing a key resistance level and market cap growth, the uncertainty around breaking higher or reversing suggests a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to capitalize on growth opportunities in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a substantial $15 trillion position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum with record futures open interest, indicating growing market confidence. Solana is also performing well, with its price rallying and DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level at $0.40, with market cap gains fueled by speculation and interest from high-profile figures. Meanwhile, USDT remains a dominant force in the stablecoin market, although its role may diminish slightly as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish sentiment and upward momentum, supported by significant market stabilization efforts and nearing a psychological price level.

ETH: +0.7 — Record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity indicate strong bullish momentum and market confidence.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive price action and high DEX volume suggest continued upward potential, supported by strong on-chain data.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with potential for a breakout, supported by market cap growth and speculative interest.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, a rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-27 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a significant $15 trillion position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures interest and activity, indicating strong bullish momentum. Solana continues to rally, driven by high on-chain activity and DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, bolstered by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin due to regulatory shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with a bullish trend and supportive news, suggesting further potential gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is reinforced by record futures interest and increased activity, indicating confidence in continued price appreciation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong price action and high DEX volume support a positive outlook, though the recent slight price decrease warrants cautious optimism.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, its market cap growth and speculative interest provide some support for modest gains.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite its dominance in the stablecoin market, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests a neutral stance on holding USDT."
2024-11-27 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by significant market interventions. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana is also on an upward trajectory, driven by high DEX volumes surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap growth fueled by speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there is a shift in focus due to regulatory changes in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and renewed bullish sentiment, supported by significant market interventions and positive news.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making it attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's strong price rally, supported by high DEX volumes and positive news, suggests continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level with positive market cap growth, but the potential for a reversal warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-27 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-27 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a massive $15T position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting a record high, indicating growing market confidence. Solana continues its upward trajectory, supported by strong on-chain and derivatives data, and has surpassed Ethereum in DEX volume, highlighting its growing prominence. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, with market cap boosts from speculation around Musk and ETPs. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin, EURt.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and the stabilization of the market after a significant sell-off indicate robust upward momentum. Positive news and technical indicators support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's futures market activity and price surge suggest strong bullish momentum, warranting a higher allocation despite already significant holdings.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new highs and leading DEX volume, coupled with positive technical indicators, make it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and speculation-driven momentum provide a moderate positive outlook, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate as capital is rotated into more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding towards the $100K mark after a recent dip, supported by significant market stabilizing bets. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana is also showing strength, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap growth fueled by speculation. Meanwhile, Tether remains a dominant force in the stablecoin market, though the focus is shifting due to regulatory changes in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive news sentiment, with Bitcoin rebounding and nearing $100K.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum supported by record futures open interest and increased market confidence, making it an attractive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive on-chain and derivatives data, along with a new price high, suggest continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with strong market cap growth; potential for breakout if resistance is overcome.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite its dominance in the stablecoin market, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests holding rather than increasing exposure to stablecoins."
2024-11-27 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip and nearing the $100K mark again. Ethereum is also showing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels and on-chain activity surging. Solana continues to rally, supported by strong on-chain and derivatives data, and has seen significant trading volume on decentralized exchanges. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired, reflecting regulatory shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with significant on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity indicate strong market confidence and potential for continued upward movement.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's rally and high DEX volume demonstrate robust demand and positive momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, its market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderate bullish outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stablecoin environment that remains supportive, there is no immediate need to adjust exposure to USDT."
2024-11-27 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong market confidence and bullish momentum.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has surged past $95K, supported by significant ETF inflows, although the upcoming expiration of $13.6 billion in options indicates some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential to reach higher price targets due to strong buying pressure and ETF inflows. Solana is gaining attention with a new ETF filing and substantial ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin is seeing renewed interest with a significant increase in trading volume. Tether's expansion onto the TON blockchain suggests a strategic move to enhance liquidity, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving bullish momentum, with price surging past $95K. The upcoming options expiry is a minor concern, but overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum with potential to reach $4,500. ETF inflows and technical indicators support further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments with a new ETF filing and significant ecosystem growth indicate strong investor confidence and potential for further price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.4 — Renewed investor interest and a substantial increase in trading volume suggest potential upside, although speculative nature warrants cautious optimism.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT as capital is likely to rotate into more volatile assets."
2024-11-28 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong ETF inflows and bullish news support upward momentum, although cautious sentiment around options expiry tempers enthusiasm slightly.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and ETF inflows suggest potential for further gains, with bullish news reinforcing upward momentum.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive signals, though current holdings are minimal, suggesting a cautious increase.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant trading volume and price increases indicate potential upside, but the speculative nature warrants a moderate score.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need to hold USDT."
2024-11-28 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum driven by ETF inflows and bullish technical indicators. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, supported by institutional interest, while Ethereum is targeting further gains with potential to reach $4,500. Solana is also experiencing positive momentum with increased TVL and interest in a new ETF. Dogecoin has seen a substantial increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with low volatility, which may support risk-on sentiment. However, the presence of significant Bitcoin options expiry suggests some market caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and ETF inflows indicate robust institutional interest, supporting further gains despite the upcoming options expiry.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further price increases make it attractive, although technical indicators suggest some caution.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive developments in Solana's ecosystem and ETF interest support a modestly bullish outlook, despite recent price fluctuations.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, USDT remains neutral as the market shows a risk-on sentiment, reducing the need for stablecoin exposure."
2024-11-28 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum driven by ETF inflows and bullish price movements. Bitcoin has surged past $95K, supported by institutional interest, though the impending expiry of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also showing strong momentum, with potential targets above $4,000, fueled by ETF inflows and technical indicators. Solana is gaining traction with a new ETF filing and substantial ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin is experiencing a resurgence in trading volume and price, indicating renewed investor interest. Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving price increases, though the options expiry suggests some caution. Overall, BTC remains attractive.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains make ETH appealing, supported by strong buying pressure and ETF inflows.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive indicators for Solana, though the price movement is less pronounced compared to BTC and ETH.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased trading volume and positive sentiment provide some upside potential, but the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, holding USDT is less attractive in the current environment."
2024-11-28 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum suggesting strong institutional interest. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, driven by ETF inflows and institutional interest, although the upcoming expiry of $13.6 billion in Bitcoin options indicates some market caution. Ethereum has broken the $3,600 mark with potential to reach $4,500, supported by bullish momentum and ETF inflows.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price is gaining momentum with potential for further upside, driven by ETF inflows and bullish technical indicators. The positive news and technicals justify a favorable allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ecosystem growth and new ETF filing reflect increased investor confidence and institutional interest, supporting a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite low on-chain activity, Dogecoin's significant trading volume increase and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, warranting a slight positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as capital is rotated into more volatile assets."

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, supported by ETF inflows and strong institutional interest, although the impending expiry of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum has broken the $3,600 mark, with analysts predicting potential further gains towards $4,500, driven by bullish momentum and ETF inflows. Solana is seeing increased attention due to a new ETF filing and a significant increase in its total value locked, indicating robust ecosystem growth.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum with potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ecosystem growth and institutional interest through ETF filings indicate a positive outlook, despite recent price volatility.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and renewed investor interest suggest potential upside, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, USDT remains a neutral option for now, serving as a potential safe haven if market conditions shift."
2024-11-28 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest driving inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, suggesting a bullish outlook for these assets. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K and Ethereum's break above $3,600 highlight strong buying momentum, although the impending expiration of a large volume of Bitcoin options indicates some market caution. Solana is witnessing growing institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by a significant increase in total value locked (TVL) and a new ETF filing. Dogecoin has seen a substantial increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether's recent developments, including the discontinuation of EURT and expansion on the TON blockchain, reflect its strategic adjustments in response to market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and price momentum, coupled with ETF-related news, suggest continued upward potential, making BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and positive technical indicators, justify a strong buy signal.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as indicated by ETF filing and TVL increase, provide a positive outlook for Solana, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant trading volume surge and positive price projections suggest potential upside, though with higher volatility, warranting cautious optimism.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a generally bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate, as capital is better allocated to growth assets."
2024-11-28 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant developments in the ETF space driving interest in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

2024-11-28 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is experiencing significant ETF inflows, although the impending expiration of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also seeing bullish momentum with potential for further gains, driven by strong buying pressure and ETF inflows. Solana is gaining attention due to a new ETF filing and significant growth in its ecosystem's total value locked. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is witnessing a surge in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, although it is discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and institutional interest are supportive, but caution is warranted due to the upcoming options expiry and lack of strong technical buy signals.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and ETF inflows suggest potential for further gains, supported by positive news and technical indicators pointing towards a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.3 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive, but technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderate allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased trading volume and positive price projections indicate potential upside, though technical signals are currently neutral.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the market showing cautious optimism, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as risk appetite appears to be increasing."
2024-11-28 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price movements in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has seen a notable increase, supported by ETF inflows, although the impending expiration of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as technical indicators remain positive. Solana is seeing increased institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by a recent ETF filing and a substantial rise in total value locked. Dogecoin's trading volume has surged, indicating renewed investor interest, although its price remains volatile. Tether's strategic expansion onto the TON blockchain suggests efforts to enhance liquidity and accessibility, despite regulatory challenges with other stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price increases and strong ETF inflows, the looming options expiry introduces some uncertainty. However, institutional interest remains a positive driver.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains are supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.4 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion, as indicated by ETF filings and increased TVL, make Solana relatively attractive.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased trading volume and optimistic price projections suggest potential upside, but volatility remains a concern.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the cautious optimism in the market, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as it provides liquidity without committing to riskier assets."
2024-11-28 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge due to ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, although the impending expiry of a large volume of Bitcoin options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also showing bullish momentum, with predictions of further price increases supported by ETF inflows and potential short squeezes. Solana is gaining attention from institutional investors with a new ETF filing and a substantial increase in its total value locked, highlighting ecosystem growth. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest and potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, although it is discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving positive sentiment, despite the cautious outlook due to options expiry. The overall trend supports a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, as indicated by technical analysis and ETF inflows, justify a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive indicators, though the lack of immediate technical buy signals suggests a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in trading volume and renewed investor interest provide a slight positive bias, but the lack of strong technical signals warrants a conservative approach.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a neutral market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate as capital rotation into riskier assets is not yet fully justified."
2024-11-28 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving price increases for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge, bolstered by ETF inflows, although the impending expiration of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with predictions of further price increases supported by strong buying pressure. Solana is gaining attention due to ETF filings and substantial growth in its ecosystem's total value locked, indicating increased investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed interest, although its future price predictions remain speculative. Tether is expanding its USDT reach, which could enhance liquidity, but its discontinuation of the EURT stablecoin reflects regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite cautious sentiment due to options expiry, strong ETF inflows and institutional interest suggest potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news on potential price increases make Ethereum attractive, with strong buying pressure supporting further growth.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and significant ecosystem growth indicate a positive outlook, making Solana a promising asset.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased trading volume and renewed investor interest provide a modestly positive outlook, though speculative predictions warrant caution.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, maintaining neutrality in USDT is prudent as other assets show more potential for gains."
2024-11-28 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

ETH: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive, though current holdings are minimal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and investor interest suggest potential upside, but maintain cautious optimism.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintain neutral stance as market conditions are mixed, with no current holdings to reduce."
2024-11-28 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by significant gains in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin over the past month. Bitcoin's price is nearing $100K, supported by strong institutional mining activity, while Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating investor interest. Solana is experiencing increased DeFi activity, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, and Dogecoin has rallied significantly, partly due to high-profile discussions involving Elon Musk. However, technical indicators across most assets show no clear buy signals, suggesting a cautious approach is warranted. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a strong U.S. dollar.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, Bitcoin's strong monthly performance and institutional interest suggest a positive outlook. The nearing of $100K could trigger further bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — The record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong investor interest, although mixed signals from founders warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's re-enabled trading on Bitstamp and significant DeFi activity provide a strong bullish case, supported by positive momentum indicators.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, the lack of technical buy signals and low on-chain activity suggest a more tempered approach, despite high-profile discussions potentially driving future interest.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stable macroeconomic conditions, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as capital rotates into riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and showing strong monthly gains. Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating institutional interest, although recent price movements suggest some caution. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity and DeFi volume, particularly in the U.S. market, which is boosting its appeal. Dogecoin has had a remarkable rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to play a crucial role in liquidity provision, despite some negative news regarding its use in illicit activities. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong dollar, suggests a balanced risk environment, supporting the current bullish trend in cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, coupled with positive news and high on-chain activity, supports a bullish outlook. The recent price surge and institutional mining activity further enhance its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, the significant ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to potential volatility.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increased trading activity and DeFi volume, along with the resumption of U.S. trading, indicate strong demand and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — The massive rally and upcoming discussions involving influential figures provide a positive sentiment boost, although technical indicators remain mixed.

USDT: 0.0 — While there is no current holding, the stablecoin's role in liquidity provision remains crucial. However, the market's bullish sentiment suggests a preference for riskier assets."
2024-11-29 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with notable upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin has experienced significant gains, nearing $100K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive sentiment. Ethereum is seeing substantial ETF inflows, although mixed signals from its founder have introduced some caution. Solana has benefited from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, contributing to its price surge. Dogecoin has also seen a massive rally, supported by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet demand, despite concerns over its use in illicit activities. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, which may further support risk-on behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum and positive news, including nearing a significant psychological level, suggest further upside potential. Institutional interest remains robust, supporting a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has seen record ETF inflows, mixed signals from its founder and a lack of technical buy signals warrant a cautious but positive outlook.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's price breakout, coupled with increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest, indicates strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Despite low on-chain activity, Dogecoin's significant price rally and upcoming discussions involving influential figures like Elon Musk provide a positive sentiment boost.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a rotation into more volatile assets to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-11-29 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin has experienced a substantial monthly gain, nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive sentiment. Ethereum has seen record ETF inflows, although mixed signals from its founders have introduced some caution. Solana's DeFi activity has surpassed Ethereum's, highlighting its growing ecosystem. Dogecoin has also rallied significantly, supported by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving high-profile figures. Despite these bullish trends, Tether remains a stable presence, with recent minting activities to meet demand, although it faces scrutiny due to its involvement in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with positive news on institutional mining and nearing a significant price milestone. The bullish sentiment is supported by technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has seen record ETF inflows, mixed founder signals introduce caution. However, the overall market sentiment remains positive, warranting a modest increase.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and recent price breakout signal a bullish trend. The resumption of trading on Bitstamp further supports its attractiveness.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite a significant rally, the lack of substantial new developments in the past hours suggests a more cautious approach, though the overall market sentiment remains supportive.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and recent price gains due to renewed trading on Bitstamp highlight its growing prominence, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of strong technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a cautious approach, though broader market gains provide some support.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish market sentiment, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark and showing strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and institutional mining activity. Ethereum is experiencing significant inflows into ETFs, although mixed signals from its founder have introduced some caution. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, indicating strong market interest. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Tether remains stable but has been involved in controversial activities, highlighting its dual role in market liquidity and illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news, with Bitcoin nearing a significant psychological level. Institutional support is also evident.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive ETF inflows suggest institutional interest, though caution is warranted due to mixed signals from its founder.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong DeFi activity and renewed trading on major platforms indicate robust demand and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite a massive recent rally, the potential for regulatory discussions could introduce volatility, warranting a cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether remains stable, its involvement in illicit activities suggests maintaining a neutral stance as risk appetite in other assets increases."
2024-11-29 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and showing strong momentum, supported by institutional mining activity. Ethereum is experiencing significant inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, driving its price upward. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, fueled by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although it faces negative news regarding its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with a potential breakout above the upper Bollinger Band, supported by positive news and institutional interest. 

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, the technical indicators remain neutral, and recent price pullbacks suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is experiencing positive momentum and increased DeFi activity, with supportive news from Bitstamp trading resumption.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the recent rally and potential regulatory discussions, low on-chain activity suggests a moderate approach.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and ongoing demand, maintain a neutral stance as the market shows a risk-on sentiment."
2024-11-29 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $98K and experiencing its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum has seen significant inflows into ETFs, suggesting strong institutional interest, although recent price pullbacks indicate mixed sentiment. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi activity has surpassed Ethereum's, which is a positive sign for its ecosystem. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader crypto gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong S&P 500, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and significant monthly gains, coupled with positive mining activity, suggest continued bullish sentiment. The macro environment also supports risk assets.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed signals, the substantial ETF inflows indicate strong institutional interest, warranting a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — The resumption of U.S. trading and impressive DeFi activity provide a strong bullish case for Solana, suggesting potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of strong technical or on-chain signals tempers the enthusiasm slightly, though it remains positive.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a generally bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral position on USDT is prudent, as capital is likely to rotate into riskier assets."
2024-11-29 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark and achieving significant monthly gains. Ethereum is experiencing strong ETF inflows, indicating growing institutional interest, although recent price movements have been mixed. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest in the U.S., while Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and supportive conditions for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news about institutional mining and price gains suggest further upside potential. The overall market sentiment is supportive of continued capital allocation to BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, the strong ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in trading activity and DeFi volume, along with bullish technical indicators, support a favorable view on Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — While the recent rally is impressive, the lack of significant new developments and low on-chain activity suggest a cautious approach, maintaining a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing strong bullish sentiment, reducing exposure to stablecoins in favor of more volatile assets aligns with the current risk-on environment."
2024-11-29 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $98K and experiencing its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum is seeing significant inflows into its ETFs, indicating strong institutional interest, although technical signals remain mixed. Solana is benefiting from renewed trading activity in the U.S. and impressive DeFi volume, surpassing Ethereum. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven by broader crypto market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see substantial minting activity to meet demand, although it faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and institutional mining activity, suggests continued bullish sentiment. The price is approaching a key psychological level, which may attract further buying interest.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, the significant inflows into Ethereum ETFs and recent price highs indicate a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to potential pullbacks.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive news regarding U.S. trading resumption and strong DeFi activity support a bullish stance. The asset shows strong momentum and increasing interest.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's significant rally and potential regulatory discussions with influential figures like Musk suggest continued positive sentiment. The breakout above the upper Bollinger Band indicates strong upward momentum.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether is seeing increased minting activity, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests a neutral stance as investors may prefer riskier assets over stablecoins."
2024-11-29 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and experiencing its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum has seen significant inflows into ETFs, indicating strong institutional interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founder. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi activity has surpassed Ethereum's. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Tether continues to see strong demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although it faces negative news regarding its use in money laundering.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news on mining activity and nearing a significant price milestone. The bullish sentiment and technical indicators support a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has seen strong ETF inflows, its technical indicators are mixed. The recent price pullback suggests some caution, but overall institutional interest is a positive sign.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's re-enabled trading in the U.S. and strong DeFi activity provide a bullish outlook. The recent price breakout supports a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite a significant rally, Dogecoin's technical indicators remain bullish. However, the potential regulatory discussions introduce some uncertainty, warranting a moderate positive score.

USDT: 0.0 — While there is strong demand for USDT, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests a preference for riskier assets. However, given the lack of USDT in the current portfolio, no reduction is possible."
2024-11-29 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana has benefited from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading support, while Dogecoin's massive rally is buoyed by speculative interest and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable but faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities, highlighting the ongoing demand for stablecoins amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and bullish technical indicators, suggests continued growth potential. The nearing of $100K and institutional mining activity further bolster confidence.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from recent price pullbacks, the significant ETF inflows and bullish momentum indicators suggest a favorable outlook for Ethereum, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive developments, including increased DEX activity and renewed trading support, indicate strong growth prospects, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's significant rally and speculative interest provide a moderate buy signal, although caution is advised due to potential volatility and regulatory discussions.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether remains stable, the ongoing market rally suggests a neutral stance as capital rotates into riskier assets. However, its role in illicit activities warrants caution."
2024-11-29 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

2024-11-29 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable increase, nearing $98K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive sentiment. Ethereum has also seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest in the U.S., while Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, partly fueled by upcoming discussions involving Musk. Tether remains stable, but recent news of its involvement in money laundering could raise concerns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional mining activity, coupled with positive news, suggest continued growth potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong investor interest, though caution is advised due to mixed founder signals.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in DeFi activity and renewed U.S. trading interest support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite a recent rally, upcoming discussions involving Musk could further influence sentiment positively.

USDT: 0.0 — While stable, recent negative news regarding money laundering may warrant caution, but no immediate action is needed given current market conditions."
2024-11-29 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has shown strong price gains, nearing the $100K mark, driven by positive sentiment and increased institutional mining activity. Ethereum is also experiencing robust inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on Bitstamp, while Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, largely driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Tether remains stable, though recent news highlights its involvement in illicit activities, which could impact its perception.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, coupled with positive news on institutional mining, suggests continued bullish sentiment. The proximity to the $100K mark adds to its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite a slight pullback, Ethereum's record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong investor interest, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's resumption of trading on Bitstamp and impressive DeFi activity provide a strong bullish case, reinforcing its appeal in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of substantial new developments in the last hour tempers the enthusiasm slightly, though it remains positive.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the bullish market conditions, there is no immediate need to hold USDT, but recent news about its use in illicit activities warrants caution, maintaining a neutral stance."
2024-11-29 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and Ethereum ETFs seeing significant inflows. Bitcoin's strong price momentum and institutional mining activity support its upward trajectory. Ethereum, despite a slight pullback, shows robust demand through ETF inflows. Solana benefits from increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp, while Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven partly by speculative interest and potential regulatory discussions. Tether remains stable, though recent news highlights its use in illicit activities, which could impact sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum, supported by high on-chain activity and positive news about institutional mining. The bullish sentiment and nearing of $100K suggest further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong demand, though mixed signals from founders suggest a cautious approach. Overall, the asset remains attractive.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana benefits from increased DeFi activity and positive trading news, suggesting potential for further price appreciation. The asset's technical indicators remain strong.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite a significant recent rally, Dogecoin's momentum and potential regulatory discussions provide a moderate positive outlook. However, low on-chain activity warrants caution.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in the current bullish market environment. Recent news of its use in illicit activities does not significantly impact its role as a liquidity provider."
2024-11-29 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a strong rally, nearing $98K, and showing robust on-chain activity and institutional interest. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong investor demand, though some caution is warranted due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest, while Dogecoin has surged significantly, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Tether remains stable but is involved in some negative news regarding money laundering, though it continues to see high demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news around mining and price gains suggest continued bullish sentiment. Current holdings are minimal, allowing for increased exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from founders, the significant ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong demand. Current holdings are substantial, but the positive outlook supports maintaining a strong position.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in DeFi activity and resumed trading in the U.S. provide a bullish outlook. Current holdings are minimal, suggesting room for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price increase and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop, though the current large holding suggests a more cautious increase in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the minting of new USDT, the stablecoin's involvement in negative news and the bullish sentiment in risk assets suggest maintaining a neutral stance, especially given the lack of current holdings."
2024-11-29 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant gains across major cryptocurrencies in recent weeks. Bitcoin has experienced a substantial rally, nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has also seen notable inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although mixed signals from its founders have introduced some caution. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on major platforms, while Dogecoin has surged significantly, buoyed by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Tether remains a stable presence, although recent news of its use in illicit activities could impact its perception.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by institutional mining and nearing a significant psychological price level, makes it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals, the strong ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — The resumption of trading on Bitstamp and high DeFi activity provide a solid foundation for Solana's continued growth, justifying an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has seen impressive gains, the lack of significant on-chain activity and potential regulatory discussions suggest a cautious approach with a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment in the market, there is less need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a reduction in USDT exposure to capitalize on growth in other assets."
2024-11-29 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news flow, including nearing $100K and robust mining activity, suggest continued bullish potential.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and Ethereum seeing significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading volume, particularly in the DeFi space, while Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Despite these positive developments, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could temper some of the bullish momentum. Tether's recent minting activity suggests ongoing demand for stablecoins, though its involvement in illicit activities could pose reputational risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong monthly performance and nearing the $100K mark, combined with positive institutional mining activity, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Significant ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong institutional interest, although caution is warranted due to mixed signals from its founder.

SOL: +0.5 — Resumed trading on Bitstamp and leading DeFi activity support a positive outlook, despite the recent slight price pullback.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent gains, the low on-chain activity and potential regulatory scrutiny suggest a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — While there is strong demand for USDT, the lack of holdings and potential reputational risks from money laundering news suggest maintaining a neutral stance."
2024-11-30 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is slightly decreasing as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is making strides in scalability improvements, which could bolster its long-term appeal. Solana, despite a recent dip, maintains a bullish outlook with positive predictions for future price increases. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its market share, reflecting strong demand for stablecoins in the DeFi space. The macroeconomic backdrop, with stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, supports a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued interest, though the lack of a clear momentum signal tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and stable on-chain activity provide a modestly positive outlook, although recent price stability suggests limited immediate upside.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future price predictions, despite a recent dip, make it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin shows potential for further gains, its recent consolidation and lack of significant bullish momentum warrant a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.2 — With no current holdings, the preference is to reduce exposure to stablecoins slightly, given the overall positive sentiment in the broader crypto market."
2024-11-30 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is focusing on scalability improvements, while Solana is experiencing a price correction amidst a generally bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Tether continues to expand its market presence, highlighting the growing demand for stablecoins. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant disruptions in traditional markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price corrections, Bitcoin's strong November rally and increased on-chain activity suggest continued support. However, the shift towards altcoins tempers the enthusiasm slightly.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's focus on scalability and recent positive news regarding Tornado Cash sanctions provide a supportive backdrop, though technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana has seen a price dip, the overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts support a modest allocation increase.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin is consolidating within a bullish pattern, but without a clear breakout signal, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.2 — With growing risk appetite and capital rotation into altcoins, maintaining a lower exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-30 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's dominance is decreasing as capital flows into altcoins, suggesting a potential altseason. Ethereum is seeing positive developments with scalability improvements, though legal challenges around Tornado Cash remain a concern. Solana is experiencing a price correction but maintains a bullish outlook with predictions of future gains. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with analysts predicting further upside. Tether continues to expand its supply to meet DeFi demand, reflecting strong stablecoin market growth.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K indicate continued bullish sentiment. However, the lack of significant momentum signals suggests a moderate allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive news on scalability improvements and a slight upward price trend support a favorable outlook. The bullish momentum signal further strengthens the case for increased exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a price correction, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions warrant a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout suggest a modest increase in exposure, though recent price decreases temper enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stablecoin market expansion, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate as risk appetite remains balanced."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is experiencing positive developments with its scalability upgrade, and Solana shows signs of continued bullish momentum despite recent price consolidation. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, indicating robust demand in the DeFi and trading sectors. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a risk-on environment, which could favor cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent rally and strong market sentiment, despite a slight decrease in dominance, suggest continued potential for gains. However, the lack of a strong momentum signal tempers the score.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's positive technical indicators and news of scalability improvements provide a strong bullish outlook. The breakout above the Bollinger Bands further supports an increased allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite recent price consolidation, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive news forecast a potential upward movement, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a slight positive bias, though the lack of strong momentum signals suggests caution.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stablecoin market that continues to grow, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as risk appetite remains elevated."
2024-11-30 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's market dominance is declining as investors shift focus to altcoins, indicating a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing bullish momentum, supported by technical upgrades and favorable legal news. Solana is experiencing consolidation but maintains a bullish outlook, while Dogecoin is stabilizing after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, reflecting strong demand in DeFi and trading sectors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight pullback, Bitcoin's recent strong performance and the potential for further gains warrant a positive allocation, though caution is advised due to declining dominance.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish momentum, technical upgrades, and favorable news provide strong support for increased allocation, especially given its breakout potential.

SOL: +0.3 — While experiencing some consolidation, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions justify a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout suggest a slight increase in allocation, but with careful monitoring.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into altcoins, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The current market sentiment is generally bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has decreased as capital flows into altcoins. Ethereum is showing strong technical signals with bullish momentum and potential scalability improvements, while Solana is experiencing a slight pullback but remains in an overall bullish trend. Dogecoin has consolidated after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical patterns. The stablecoin market continues to grow, led by USDT, which remains a key player in the DeFi and trading sectors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K indicate continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding scalability improvements, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future price predictions support a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for significant gains warrant a cautious buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a growing stablecoin market, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as risk appetite in the market increases."
2024-11-30 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum shows strong bullish signals with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, suggesting continued upward momentum. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains a bullish outlook with positive future price predictions. Dogecoin is consolidating within a bullish pattern, indicating potential for further gains. Tether remains stable, with significant minting activity to meet DeFi demand, reflecting its strong position in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of technical buy signals, Bitcoin's recent rally and high transaction activity suggest continued interest and potential for further gains, though with caution due to declining dominance.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news around scalability improvements make Ethereum an attractive asset for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Although currently consolidating, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for significant upside justify a slight increase in exposure, despite low on-chain activity.

USDT: -0.1 — With a generally bullish market sentiment and increasing risk appetite, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted to allocate more capital to growth assets."
2024-11-30 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant gains seen in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past month. Bitcoin's price has approached the $100K mark, driven by post-election optimism, although its market dominance has decreased as investors shift towards altcoins, indicating a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum continues to show strength with its scalability upgrades, while Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing bullish patterns, suggesting potential for further gains. The stablecoin market remains robust, with Tether leading the charge, reflecting strong demand in DeFi and trading activities. Despite the positive trends, the macroeconomic environment, characterized by a high U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced approach to risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of short-term buy signals, Bitcoin's strong monthly performance and nearing of the $100K mark suggest continued bullish sentiment. However, the shift towards altcoins tempers the score slightly.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum shows strong technical indicators with bullish momentum and potential breakout signals. The recent upgrades and legal clarity around Tornado Cash further bolster its attractiveness.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's technical indicators are positive, with recent bullish momentum and favorable price forecasts supporting a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical trends. However, low on-chain activity suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as other assets show more growth potential."
2024-11-30 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong November rally, although its dominance has slightly decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, while Solana maintains a bullish trend despite a recent price dip. Dogecoin is consolidating after a substantial rally, with analysts predicting further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand, reflecting strong demand in the stablecoin market. The macroeconomic environment, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and proximity to $100K provide a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to the shift towards altcoins.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish momentum, supported by technical upgrades and legal clarity, makes it an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future price predictions suggest a favorable outlook, despite recent consolidation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains provide a moderate buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a balanced risk environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as capital rotates towards riskier assets."
2024-11-30 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's bullish trend and positive news forecasts provide a favorable outlook, though recent price pullbacks suggest some caution.

DOGE: +0.2 — While DOGE has seen significant recent gains, current consolidation and potential for further breakout justify a modest positive score.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stable market conditions, maintaining a neutral position on USDT is prudent, allowing for flexibility in reallocating capital as needed."
2024-11-30 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K milestone after a strong rally in November, although its market dominance is decreasing as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum continues to show strength with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, supporting its bullish momentum. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains a positive outlook with predictions of further price increases. Dogecoin has consolidated after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical patterns. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion indicates strong demand in the DeFi and trading sectors, although its role as a stablecoin suggests a more conservative allocation in a bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a slight drop in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and on-chain activity suggest continued interest, though caution is warranted given the shift towards altcoins.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and positive news on scalability improvements and legal clarity support a higher allocation preference.

SOL: +0.4 — While experiencing a minor pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions justify a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains suggest a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — As the market leans bullish, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, allowing for potential capital rotation into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal news. Solana, despite a recent dip, maintains a bullish outlook with positive forecasts. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand, reflecting strong demand in the stablecoin market. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong dollar, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets, but the low volatility index indicates a relatively calm market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, Bitcoin's recent rally and high transaction activity suggest a cautiously positive outlook, though its reduced dominance warrants a moderate score.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and positive news on scalability improvements support a favorable outlook for Ethereum, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.4 — Although SOL experienced a slight pullback, the overall bullish trend and positive forecasts indicate potential for further gains, justifying a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE is consolidating with potential for a breakout, the lack of immediate bullish momentum and low transaction activity suggest a neutral stance for now.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing exposure to USDT aligns with the current market sentiment favoring riskier assets."
2024-11-30 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its market dominance is declining as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is experiencing positive developments with scalability improvements, while Solana is consolidating after a recent dip, with forecasts suggesting potential future gains. Dogecoin is trading within a bullish pattern, indicating potential for further upside. The stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether leading the charge, reflecting strong demand in DeFi and trading activities. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with altcoins showing potential for growth as Bitcoin's dominance wanes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent rally, BTC's market dominance is declining, suggesting a shift towards altcoins. However, strong on-chain activity supports a modest positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and scalability improvements provide a strong case for Ethereum, making it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

SOL: +0.4 — Consolidation after a dip and positive future forecasts suggest potential for upward movement, warranting a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Trading within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout supports a cautious positive stance, although low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stablecoin demand remaining strong, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent as risk appetite shifts towards altcoins."
2024-11-30 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as investors shift towards altcoins. Ethereum is showing bullish signals with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, while Solana is experiencing a minor pullback but remains in a long-term upward trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a favorable backdrop for risk assets, though the high U.S. dollar index may temper some enthusiasm. Tether continues to expand its market presence, indicating robust demand for stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a slight drop in market dominance, Bitcoin's recent rally and strong on-chain activity suggest a moderate buy signal, though caution is warranted due to potential capital rotation into altcoins.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and positive news regarding scalability improvements and legal clarity support a bullish stance on Ethereum.

SOL: +0.2 — While experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future price predictions justify a modest buy signal.

DOGE: +0.1 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains suggest a slight increase in allocation, though the lack of immediate catalysts tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stable macroeconomic conditions, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as risk appetite remains steady."
2024-11-30 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the significant $100K milestone following a strong rally in November. However, BTC's market dominance is waning as investors shift focus towards altcoins, suggesting a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum is making strides in scalability with its Pectra upgrade, and Solana is showing signs of consolidation after a recent dip, with predictions of continued upward momentum. Dogecoin is in a consolidation phase after a significant rally, with expectations of further gains. The stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether maintaining a dominant position, indicating ongoing demand for stable assets amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a lack of immediate buy signals, BTC's recent rally and strong on-chain activity support a moderately positive outlook. The potential for further gains remains, although dominance is shifting.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical indicators are favorable, with bullish momentum and positive news regarding scalability improvements, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — While recent price corrections suggest consolidation, the overall bullish trend and positive forecasts support a cautious increase in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout warrant a slight positive allocation, though the lack of strong technical signals suggests caution.

USDT: -0.2 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, maintaining high exposure to USDT is less attractive, though a complete shift away from stablecoins is not yet advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong November rally. However, its dominance is declining as capital shifts towards altcoins, suggesting the onset of an ""altseason."" Ethereum is seeing positive developments with scalability improvements, while Solana's price is consolidating after a recent dip, with forecasts predicting further upward momentum. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Tether continues to expand its supply to meet growing demand in DeFi and trading, highlighting the stablecoin's dominance in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite strong recent gains, Bitcoin's declining dominance suggests a shift towards altcoins. Maintain a moderate allocation to capture potential further upside while diversifying into other assets.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive developments in scalability and legal clarity around Tornado Cash support Ethereum's outlook. The technical buy signals also suggest a favorable environment for ETH.

SOL: +0.2 — Although Solana is consolidating, the overall bullish trend and positive forecasts warrant a slight increase in allocation to capture potential upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.1 — Dogecoin is trading near the upper end of its consolidation range, with potential for a breakout. A modest allocation increase is justified by its recent rally and bullish pattern.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of risk appetite and capital rotation into altcoins, reduce exposure to USDT to reallocate capital towards more volatile assets with growth potential."
2024-11-30 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing signs of scalability improvements with its Pectra upgrade, while Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing consolidation phases, suggesting potential for future gains. The stablecoin market remains robust, with Tether continuing to expand its supply to meet demand. Despite some technical indicators showing bearish signals, the broader market narrative remains positive, with potential for further growth in altcoins and continued interest in Bitcoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a lack of immediate buy signals, Bitcoin's strong November rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued optimism. However, the drop in dominance indicates a need for cautious allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's technical improvements and ongoing scalability efforts provide a positive outlook, though mixed momentum signals warrant a moderate allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — While experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions support a cautious buy stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent consolidation and potential for a breakout, the lack of strong technical signals and mixed market activity suggest a hold position.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance has slightly decreased as investors shift towards altcoins. Ethereum's recent technical upgrades and legal developments have bolstered its scalability and regulatory clarity, respectively. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase after a brief dip, but forecasts suggest continued upward momentum. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical trends. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet growing DeFi and trading demands, indicating strong stablecoin market growth.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight dip in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and nearing the $100K mark suggest continued upward momentum, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and legal clarity provide a supportive environment for growth, along with a consistent buy signal from trend indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — Although currently consolidating, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive forecasts justify a cautious buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains suggest a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stablecoin market expansion, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent as risk appetite remains moderate."
2024-11-30 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.3 — Although currently in a consolidation phase, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future forecasts justify a moderate positive allocation.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing positive developments with scalability improvements, while Solana is experiencing a slight pullback but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, suggesting potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether leading the charge, indicating strong demand in DeFi and trading sectors. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, which could support continued growth in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish momentum signal a favorable outlook. The recent surge in on-chain activity supports this positive sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical indicators are strong, with a consistent buy signal and improving scalability. The recent court ruling also provides a favorable regulatory environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's long-term bullish trend and positive news forecasts suggest potential for growth, warranting a moderate allocation increase.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a cautious increase in allocation, especially given the historical uptrend predictions.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullishness and increased risk appetite, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is decreasing as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing positive developments with scalability improvements, while Solana is experiencing a slight pullback but remains in a bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, indicating potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to grow, with Tether leading the charge, reflecting strong demand in DeFi and trading activities. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a favorable environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish momentum, combined with positive news, suggest continued upward potential, though its decreasing dominance warrants some caution.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and news about scalability improvements support a bullish outlook, making ETH relatively attractive in the current market environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite a slight price pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future forecasts justify a moderate allocation increase.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation after a significant rally and potential for further gains support a cautious positive signal, although the lack of strong technical indicators tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as risk appetite remains steady."
2024-11-30 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong rally in November, although its dominance has decreased as investors shift towards altcoins. Ethereum is showing positive developments with scalability improvements, while Solana is experiencing a price correction but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, indicating strong demand in DeFi and trading activities. Macroeconomic indicators such as a stable S&P 500 and low volatility suggest a relatively calm broader market environment, potentially supportive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish momentum signals suggest continued upside potential, warranting increased exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive technical indicators and scalability improvements contribute to a bullish outlook, though recent price decreases suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — While currently experiencing a price correction, Solana's long-term bullish trend and positive future predictions justify a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite consolidation and potential for future gains, current technical signals are mixed, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has slightly decreased as investors shift focus towards altcoins. Ethereum is showing signs of scalability improvements, which could bolster its long-term growth prospects. Solana is experiencing a temporary pullback, but forecasts suggest continued upward momentum. Dogecoin remains in a consolidation phase after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its market share, reflecting strong demand for stablecoins amid growing DeFi and trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and positive on-chain activity suggest continued upward potential, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and bullish momentum support a positive outlook, though the market is still digesting recent legal news.

SOL: 0.0 — Current technical indicators show no clear bullish signals, and the recent price pullback suggests a wait-and-see approach until more definitive trends emerge.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a slight positive bias, although caution is advised given recent volatility.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent in the current market environment."
2024-12-01 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish signals in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD, although BTC's momentum is waning. Institutional interest in BTC is rising, introducing potential risks due to its rapid price appreciation. ETH maintains a bullish technical setup but lacks significant news catalysts. SOL is underperforming with no buy signals, while DOGE shows some price recovery but lacks strong momentum. USDT remains stable, but its position as a safe haven is challenged by XRP's recent market cap surge, indicating a shift in capital flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bullish technicals, the news of increased institutional risks tempers enthusiasm. Maintain a moderate positive stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent bullish technical indicators and no negative news suggest a favorable outlook. Increase exposure slightly.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of bullish signals and no significant news suggest a neutral stance. Hold current position.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price increase warrants a slight positive adjustment, but lack of strong momentum keeps the score modest.

USDT: -0.2 — With the market showing some bullish tendencies, reduce exposure to stablecoins slightly, but maintain some allocation for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with a low volatility index (VIX) and steady interest rates, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. Bitcoin's recent price movements indicate some caution due to institutional involvement, which could introduce volatility. Ethereum shows consistent buy signals with bullish momentum, while Solana and Dogecoin lack strong technical or news-driven catalysts. USDT remains stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating potential shifts in capital flows within the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite a buy trend signal, the lack of bullish momentum and potential risks from institutional involvement suggest a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum make Ethereum relatively attractive, especially given the absence of negative news.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant technical or news-driven catalysts, Solana remains neutral in the current market environment.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price volatility and lack of strong momentum or news support suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the potential for market volatility and the recent shift in stablecoin market dynamics, maintaining some exposure to USDT could be prudent for risk management."
2024-12-01 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility (VIX at 13.4) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains high at 106.21, indicating potential pressure on risk assets. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility despite its recent price decline. Ethereum shows mixed signals with no significant news, while Solana and Dogecoin lack any major developments. Tether remains stable but has been surpassed by XRP in market capitalization, which could impact its perceived stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite institutional interest, Bitcoin's recent price decline and lack of bullish momentum suggest a cautious approach. The potential risks from institutional involvement warrant a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum maintains a buy signal on the short-term moving average, and its price is within a normal range. The lack of significant news suggests stability, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana shows no buy signal and has experienced a slight price decrease. The absence of bullish momentum and technical breakdown suggests reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin's recent price volatility and lack of bullish signals, combined with low on-chain activity, indicate a need to reduce exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — With the current market uncertainty and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against risk."
2024-12-01 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility as indicated by the VIX at 13.4, and the S&P 500 maintaining a high level. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong at 106.21, which could impact cryptocurrency flows. Bitcoin's market data indicates a mixed sentiment with increased institutional interest but also potential risks due to its rapid price appreciation. Ethereum shows consistent buy signals despite a lack of significant news, while Solana and Dogecoin exhibit no strong technical signals or news catalysts. Tether remains stable, but XRP's overtaking in market cap could influence perceptions of stablecoin utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest is a positive driver, but potential risks and lack of strong technical signals suggest a cautious approach. The mixed macro backdrop and increased on-chain activity support a moderate buy stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from technical indicators and a recent price increase suggest a favorable outlook. The absence of negative news allows for a slightly higher allocation preference.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and no strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance. The market data does not indicate any immediate opportunities or threats.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite recent price increases, the lack of strong technical or news-driven catalysts and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure slightly, given current holdings.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the mixed signals across other assets and the potential for increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT as a stable asset is prudent. The stablecoin's role as a safe haven is reinforced by the macroeconomic context."
2024-12-01 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce new risks despite its recent price appreciation. Ethereum shows a consistent buy signal in trend indicators, but lacks momentum support. Solana and Dogecoin have shown minor price fluctuations without significant news, while Tether remains stable but has been surpassed by XRP in market capitalization. The macroeconomic backdrop, with a relatively stable S&P 500 and low volatility index, suggests a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment, but the high U.S. Dollar Index indicates potential headwinds for crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest and price appreciation are positive, but potential risks and lack of technical buy signals suggest caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals in trend indicators and recent price recovery make ETH relatively attractive, despite lacking momentum.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant technical or news-driven signals; recent price stability suggests a hold position.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price decreases and low activity warrant a slight reduction in exposure to manage risk.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally neutral to slightly bullish market sentiment, a modest reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to allocate more capital to other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a stable environment with a relatively low volatility index (VIX) and a strong S&P 500, indicating a risk-on sentiment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains elevated, which could exert pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent price fluctuations and increased institutional interest suggest potential volatility, with risks associated with its rapid appreciation. Ethereum shows consistent buy signals despite a lack of significant news, indicating potential resilience. Solana and Dogecoin have shown mixed technical signals with no significant news, suggesting a neutral stance. Tether's stablecoin status remains unchanged, but the news of XRP surpassing it in market capitalization could influence its perceived stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, the lack of bullish technical signals and potential risks from rapid appreciation suggest caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity make Ethereum relatively attractive, despite the absence of news.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and no significant news warrant a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure.

DOGE: -0.1 — Slight technical improvements but low on-chain activity and lack of news suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the potential for increased volatility in other assets, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins for risk management is prudent."
2024-12-01 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a risk-on sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility despite the lack of immediate buy signals from technical indicators. Ethereum shows a consistent buy trend signal, although momentum remains weak. Solana and Dogecoin are lacking strong technical or news-driven catalysts. Tether remains stable but has been overtaken by XRP in market capitalization, which may influence its perceived stability and attractiveness.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the absence of immediate buy signals, the institutional interest could drive future price appreciation. The current market environment favors holding a moderate position in BTC.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy trend signals and a recent price increase suggest a favorable outlook. Although momentum is not yet strong, ETH appears relatively attractive compared to other assets.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant technical signals or news suggests a neutral stance. The slight price increases do not warrant a change in allocation at this time.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some price increases, the absence of strong technical signals and news keeps DOGE in a neutral position. No compelling reason to adjust holdings.

USDT: -0.2 — With a generally risk-on sentiment in the broader market, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets with potential upside."
2024-12-01 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

With a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility as indicated by the VIX, there is no immediate macroeconomic pressure on crypto markets. However, the S&P 500's high level suggests a risk-on sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into crypto assets. Bitcoin's recent price stability and institutional interest introduce both opportunities and risks, while Ethereum shows consistent, albeit low, buy signals without significant news catalysts. Solana and Dogecoin lack strong technical or news-driven signals, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's stablecoin status remains unchanged, but the news of XRP surpassing it in market cap may influence perceptions of stability and liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest suggests potential for future growth, but current technical indicators remain neutral. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators, though lacking strong momentum. Slightly positive allocation due to stable technicals.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant technical or news-driven signals to warrant a change in allocation. Maintain current exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a slight upward trend in price, the lack of significant news or technical signals suggests holding the current position.

USDT: -0.2 — With a generally risk-on sentiment and low volatility, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to reallocate capital to more volatile assets."
2024-12-01 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a positive risk-on sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into the crypto markets. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which can exert downward pressure on crypto assets. Recent market data for cryptocurrencies shows mixed signals: Bitcoin has shown a slight increase in price with bullish momentum, but institutional adoption introduces new risks. Ethereum maintains a buy trend signal, although momentum remains weak. Solana and Dogecoin have shown slight price increases, with Dogecoin showing bullish momentum. Tether's market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the bullish momentum and slight price increase, the risk from increased institutional adoption tempers enthusiasm. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy trend signals and stable price movements suggest a modest increase in allocation, despite the lack of significant news.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a significant price increase, the lack of buy signals and bullish momentum suggests holding the current position.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and consistent buy signals, combined with recent price increases, support a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stable market conditions, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is appropriate, especially given the capital rotation dynamics with XRP."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with a low volatility index (VIX at 13.4), suggesting a calm market. The S&P 500 is at a high level, indicating positive sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility but also suggests confidence in its long-term potential. Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin show mixed technical signals, with some bullish momentum but no significant news to drive strong moves. Tether's position has been slightly overshadowed by XRP's rise in market cap, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and recent bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains, though risks are noted.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity, though lacking strong news catalysts.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent price increase and normal on-chain activity warrant a cautious positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum, low on-chain activity and lack of news keep sentiment neutral.

USDT: -0.2 — With no current holdings, the preference is to rotate capital into other assets given the stable market environment and potential for gains elsewhere."
2024-12-01 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce both opportunities and risks due to its rapid price appreciation. Ethereum and Solana have no significant news, but technical indicators show mixed signals. Dogecoin has shown slight price increases but lacks strong momentum. Tether remains stable, but its position in market capitalization has been overtaken by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a strong buy signal from technical indicators, the bullish momentum and increased institutional interest suggest a moderate buy preference.

ETH: 0.0 — While there is a buy signal from the trend, the lack of bullish momentum and significant news keeps the outlook neutral.

SOL: +0.2 — Although technical indicators are mixed, the recent volume increase and normal on-chain activity suggest a slight positive bias.

DOGE: -0.1 — The recent price decrease and lack of strong momentum or news lead to a slight reduction in preference, given current holdings.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive market sentiment and the shift in market cap dynamics, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin exposure in favor of riskier assets."
2024-12-01 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by bullish technical indicators, despite concerns about increased institutional involvement introducing new risks. Ethereum and Solana exhibit mixed signals, with Ethereum maintaining a buy trend but lacking significant news to drive sentiment. Solana shows positive momentum but lacks a clear buy signal. Dogecoin's technical indicators suggest a buy, but low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin dominance. The macroeconomic context, with relatively low volatility and stable asset prices, suggests a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong bullish momentum and increased institutional interest support a positive outlook, though potential risks from institutional adoption should be monitored.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite a lack of significant news, the consistent buy trend and stable market cap suggest a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive momentum and normal on-chain activity indicate a favorable environment, though the absence of a buy trend tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: 0.0 — While technical indicators suggest a buy, low on-chain activity and lack of significant news result in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-12-01 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by both technical indicators and increased institutional interest, despite the potential risks highlighted in recent news. Ethereum, while lacking significant news, maintains a buy signal from trend indicators but lacks momentum confirmation. Solana shows bullish momentum but lacks a strong trend signal, indicating a mixed sentiment. Dogecoin, despite some buy signals, is experiencing low on-chain activity and lacks bullish momentum. USDT remains stable, but with the recent news of XRP surpassing it in market cap, there may be some shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.2 — While trend indicators are positive, the lack of momentum and significant news keeps the score modestly positive.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish momentum is present, but the absence of a strong trend signal tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite buy signals, low on-chain activity and lack of bullish momentum result in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish market sentiment and capital rotation likely towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by both price trends and on-chain activity, despite concerns about the risks associated with increased institutional involvement. Ethereum, while lacking significant news, maintains a positive trend signal but lacks bullish momentum. Solana shows consistent bullish momentum despite not having a buy signal from trend indicators. Dogecoin, despite a recent price increase, lacks strong momentum signals. Tether remains stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest a positive outlook despite institutional risk concerns.

ETH: +0.3 — While lacking bullish momentum, Ethereum's consistent trend signals and stable price movements justify a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a positive outlook, despite the absence of a trend buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, the lack of strong momentum signals and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of optimism and capital potentially rotating into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-12-01 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows relatively stable conditions with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a bullish sentiment in traditional markets, which could spill over into the crypto markets. Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and increased institutional interest, despite the potential risks highlighted by Bloomberg. Ethereum and Solana exhibit mixed signals with no significant news affecting their current outlook. Dogecoin's technical indicators are neutral, while Tether's stablecoin status remains unchanged despite being surpassed by XRP in market capitalization.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and increased on-chain activity, coupled with institutional interest, suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum lacks significant news and shows mixed momentum signals, its consistent buy trend and stable on-chain activity warrant a slight positive allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the absence of a buy trend signal, Solana's bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity suggest potential for upward movement.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in the broader market and the need to allocate more capital into riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable."
2024-12-01 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight price increases over the past few hours. Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, supported by increased institutional interest, although this also introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana are both experiencing stable price movements, with Ethereum lacking significant news to drive sentiment. Dogecoin has shown slight price increases, but without significant news or strong technical signals. Tether remains stable, but the recent news of XRP surpassing it in market capitalization could affect its perceived stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum shows positive price trends, the lack of significant news and mixed momentum signals warrant a cautious but positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the lack of a strong buy signal, Solana's consistent bullish momentum and stable price action suggest a modestly positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's technical indicators are mixed, and the absence of significant news leads to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Dogecoin displaying strong upward momentum in both price and on-chain activity. Bitcoin's price is supported by institutional interest, although this introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana show mixed signals, with Ethereum maintaining a stable trend but lacking significant news catalysts. Dogecoin has experienced a significant price increase, potentially indicating a breakout. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a risk-on environment, suggesting a shift away from stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong upward momentum and increased institutional interest suggest continued bullish potential, despite potential risks.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals in technicals, though lacking significant news catalysts. Stable on-chain activity supports a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent buy signal and bullish momentum, but no significant news to drive a stronger allocation.

DOGE: +0.8 — Significant price breakout and strong on-chain activity indicate a high potential for continued upward movement.

USDT: -0.4 — With a bullish sentiment across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish inclination for major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum supported by both technical indicators and increased institutional interest, although this also introduces new risks. Ethereum maintains a positive technical outlook, but lacks significant news catalysts. Solana and Dogecoin are showing bullish momentum signals, but lack substantial news or technical breakthroughs. Meanwhile, Tether has been overtaken by XRP in market capitalization, which might influence its perceived stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin exhibits strong bullish momentum with institutional interest, despite potential risks. Technical indicators support continued upward movement.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum shows bullish momentum and technical strength, though lacking news catalysts. It remains a solid choice given the overall market sentiment.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's technical indicators are positive, but without significant news, the score reflects moderate confidence in its potential for gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin shows bullish momentum, but with no significant news, the allocation reflects a cautious optimism based on technicals.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, USDT's attractiveness as a stable holding is reduced."
2024-12-01 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators, such as BTC and ETH, which have consistent buy signals from moving averages and bullish momentum from MACD. Bitcoin's increased institutional adoption is a double-edged sword, potentially introducing new risks despite its positive price movement. Meanwhile, DOGE has shown a recent price spike, but its technical indicators are mixed, suggesting caution. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively stable S&P 500 and low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on sentiment, though the high U.S. Dollar Index may temper some enthusiasm. The news of XRP surpassing Tether in market capitalization highlights the competitive and dynamic nature of the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with high on-chain activity, suggest continued upward potential despite institutional risk concerns.

ETH: +0.4 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, though lacking significant news, indicate a stable positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive technical indicators and stable on-chain activity support a modest bullish stance, though lacking news-driven catalysts.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, mixed technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-12-01 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators such as bullish momentum and buy signals from moving averages. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could lead to heightened volatility but also suggests confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum and Solana lack significant news, but their technical indicators remain positive. Dogecoin has shown a recent price increase, suggesting potential speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether's position as a stablecoin is challenged by XRP's rise in market capitalization, indicating a shift in capital allocation preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the potential risks from institutional adoption, Bitcoin's technical indicators are strong, and it remains a key asset in the portfolio.

ETH: +0.3 — Although there is no significant news, Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, supporting a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's technical indicators are favorable, but without significant news or volume spikes, a cautious positive stance is warranted.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price increases and positive technical indicators suggest some speculative interest, justifying a slight positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macroeconomic environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate as there is no clear signal to increase exposure."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The crypto market is experiencing bullish technical signals across most major assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong buy signals based on moving averages and momentum indicators. However, Bitcoin's rapid price appreciation and increased institutional involvement bring new risks, as highlighted by recent news. Ethereum and Solana maintain positive technical indicators, though Ethereum lacks significant news catalysts. Dogecoin shows bullish momentum, but its price movements are less significant. Tether remains stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and on-chain activity suggest continued bullish momentum, but caution is warranted due to potential risks from increased institutional involvement.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the lack of significant news, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive, supporting a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive technical signals and stable on-chain activity suggest a slight increase in exposure is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish technical signals, the lack of significant news or major changes in sentiment suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-12-01 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and positive price movements over the last few hours. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility but also suggests a growing acceptance of crypto assets. Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have shown consistent buy signals, although without significant news to drive sentiment. Dogecoin's recent price breakout above the Bollinger Bands indicates potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating a shift in capital allocation within the crypto space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum and institutional interest suggest potential for further gains, despite the risks associated with rapid appreciation.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum lacks significant news, its technical indicators remain positive, warranting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity support a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and breakout above the Bollinger Bands indicate strong upward momentum, justifying a higher allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins like USDT, suggesting a reduction in exposure."
2024-12-01 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mix of bullish and neutral signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by increased institutional interest, although this also introduces new risks. Ethereum remains relatively stable with no significant news or momentum changes. Solana shows consistent bullish momentum, though lacking strong news catalysts. Dogecoin has seen significant price fluctuations, indicating volatility but with underlying bullish momentum. Tether's position as a stablecoin remains unchanged, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, potentially affecting its attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with institutional interest, suggest a positive outlook despite potential risks.

ETH: +0.2 — Although technical indicators are neutral, Ethereum's stable price and market cap suggest a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity support a positive allocation, despite the absence of significant news.

DOGE: +0.1 — Despite recent price volatility, bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity warrant a slight positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market cap, USDT remains a neutral choice, serving as a potential hedge without immediate allocation changes."
2024-12-01 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Dogecoin showing strong upward momentum and positive news catalysts. Bitcoin benefits from continued institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum, while experiencing strong fund inflows, faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price declines. Solana is stabilizing after a supply chain attack, with analysts predicting a consolidation phase. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility but is buoyed by bullish sentiment and potential for a ""Santa Rally."" Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF-related developments support a bullish outlook. On-chain activity and technical indicators also suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, though technicals remain mixed.

SOL: 0.0 — Stabilizing price and recent security concerns suggest a cautious approach, with no strong buy or sell signals.

DOGE: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for a significant rally make DOGE attractive, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2024-12-02 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, bolstered by significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum, while seeing substantial fund inflows, faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price drops. Solana is stabilizing after a supply chain attack, with expectations of consolidation within a broad price range. Dogecoin is riding a wave of bullish momentum, with analysts predicting a potential 'Santa Rally.' Meanwhile, Tether remains stable with no significant news, suggesting a neutral stance in the absence of broader market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF-related developments provide a bullish outlook, supported by positive technical indicators and on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor interest, warranting a slightly positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — While technical indicators show bullish momentum, the recent security incident and expected price consolidation suggest a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and potential for a 'Santa Rally' support a positive outlook, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-12-02 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with bullish momentum signals in several major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum shows mixed signals with strong fund inflows but recent price declines due to momentum loss. Solana faces technical challenges with a recent supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend, with potential for a ""Santa Rally"" as analysts eye significant price gains. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option but lacks significant news or momentum to drive interest.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional interest, supported by ETF-related developments, make BTC a highly attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence, suggesting a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges and lack of clear momentum signals suggest a neutral stance until further clarity on price stabilization.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for significant price gains make DOGE an attractive option, though with inherent volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-12-02 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by relatively stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, with low volatility in the equity market as indicated by the VIX. This suggests a cautious but stable economic backdrop. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows strong institutional interest with MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, indicating a positive sentiment. Ethereum is seeing significant fund inflows, although recent price momentum has been weak. Solana faces technical challenges with a recent supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional interest and ETF developments provide strong bullish momentum, despite recent price fluctuations. The overall sentiment is positive, suggesting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant fund inflows indicate strong investor interest, but recent price momentum loss warrants a cautious approach. Maintain a moderate positive stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent security issues and price breakdown suggest caution. Despite potential stabilization, the current risks outweigh the benefits, recommending reduced exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — The potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent bullish momentum suggest a positive outlook. However, volatility remains high, warranting a balanced approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.34. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by positive news, including MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum, despite leading in fund inflows, faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price drops. Solana is under pressure from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend, with potential for a ""Santa Rally"" as analysts predict further gains. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news, such as MicroStrategy's accumulation and ETF options, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor interest, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent security concerns and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution, though potential stabilization offers some support.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" make DOGE attractive, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market signals and current portfolio status, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as it provides liquidity without immediate need for reallocation."
2024-12-02 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of investor interest despite recent price fluctuations. Bitcoin's recent accumulation by MicroStrategy and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options are positive developments, although on-chain activity remains low. Ethereum sees significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest, but recent price declines suggest short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces challenges due to a supply chain attack, which could impact developer confidence, although analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin exhibits bullish momentum, with potential for a 'Santa Rally,' while Tether remains stable without significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive news from MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and ETF options launch provide support, but low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, though recent price decline suggests caution in the short term.

SOL: -0.3 — Security concerns from the supply chain attack and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish sentiment from potential 'Santa Rally' and recent price momentum, but high volatility warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin status with no significant news; maintain current exposure as a hedge against market volatility."
2024-12-02 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a relatively risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin seeing continued institutional interest through MicroStrategy's purchases and new ETF options, while Ethereum faces short-term bearish sentiment despite strong fund inflows. Solana is dealing with a security issue, which could affect developer confidence, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of potential bullish momentum, possibly driven by speculative interest in a ""Santa Rally."" Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, strong institutional interest and new ETF options provide a bullish outlook. The overall macro environment supports risk-on assets.

ETH: +0.3 — While short-term bearish sentiment exists, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence. The macro environment supports a moderate risk-on stance.

SOL: -0.1 — Security concerns from the supply chain attack pose risks, and technical indicators do not show strong bullish signals. However, price stabilization expectations limit downside.

DOGE: +0.6 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and bullish momentum signals suggest upside potential, making it relatively attractive in the current market.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant news and a stable price, USDT remains a neutral asset, serving as a hedge against volatility without a clear directional bias."
2024-12-02 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin showing signs of strength due to continued institutional interest and new financial products, such as Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum, despite leading crypto fund inflows, is experiencing short-term bearish momentum and price declines. Solana faces technical challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is volatile, with potential for a ""Santa Rally"" but currently facing resistance. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with low volatility, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive news from institutional buying and ETF options, combined with a buy trend signal, suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin. Despite some technical indicators not being bullish, the overall sentiment and developments are supportive.

ETH: +0.2 — Although Ethereum has seen strong fund inflows, recent price declines and bearish momentum indicators warrant caution. However, the inflows indicate underlying interest, justifying a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.1 — The technical issues with the supply chain attack pose risks, and the lack of bullish signals in market data suggests a cautious approach. However, expected price stabilization provides some support.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite potential for a rally, recent price volatility and lack of strong bullish signals in the data suggest maintaining a neutral stance. The sentiment is mixed with no clear direction.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is warranted to capitalize on potential opportunities in other assets."
2024-12-02 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a general bearish trend observed in the recent price movements of major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a slight decrease in price, but there is positive news with MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide long-term support. Ethereum has experienced significant inflows into funds, indicating strong investor interest, but recent price declines suggest short-term bearish momentum. Solana is facing technical challenges with a security breach, while analysts predict price stabilization. Dogecoin shows potential for a bullish rally, but recent price volatility and breakdowns suggest caution. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, which might not significantly impact crypto markets in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF options provide a supportive backdrop, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, but recent price declines warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.1 — Security concerns from the supply chain attack and recent price breakdown suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with potential for a rally but recent volatility and breakdowns suggest holding current positions.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the overall bearish sentiment and recent price declines across assets, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins for risk management is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies, with a notable bearish sentiment in the short term. Bitcoin's recent ETF-related developments and MicroStrategy's continued accumulation provide a bullish backdrop, though technical indicators remain weak. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, suggesting investor interest, despite recent price declines. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin shows potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" though recent volatility suggests caution. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a cautious approach, with a potential preference for risk-off assets like USDT in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite weak technical indicators, positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF developments provide a supportive backdrop for potential upside.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, although recent price declines warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — The supply chain attack poses risks, but expected price stabilization suggests a neutral stance for now.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent price recovery indicate moderate bullish sentiment, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for further downside in risk assets, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation is prudent."
2024-12-02 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with a general bearish trend observed in the short-term technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Despite some positive news, such as MicroStrategy's continued BTC accumulation and significant inflows into ETH funds, the technical indicators suggest a lack of immediate bullish momentum. DOGE shows potential for a short-term rally, driven by speculative interest and news of a possible ""Santa Rally."" Meanwhile, macroeconomic indicators, such as a high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices, suggest a cautious approach to risk assets, potentially supporting a higher allocation to stablecoins like USDT in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bearish technical signals, the news of MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options provide a supportive backdrop for potential medium-term gains.

ETH: +0.1 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor interest, but recent price declines and bearish technicals warrant caution. A slight positive bias is maintained due to the inflows.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical indicators are bearish, and the recent security issue with the Solana library adds risk. However, price stabilization forecasts provide some balance, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — News of a potential ""Santa Rally"" and attempts to break resistance levels suggest speculative interest, warranting a moderate positive allocation despite recent volatility.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the overall bearish technical environment and macroeconomic caution, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-12-02 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index. However, the crypto market is experiencing a mixed sentiment. Bitcoin is seeing continued institutional interest with MicroStrategy's purchase and new ETF options, but technical indicators remain bearish. Ethereum is attracting significant fund inflows, yet its price has recently dropped, reflecting short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces security concerns from a supply chain attack, though analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin shows potential for a bullish rally, but recent price action remains volatile. Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and new ETF options provide a supportive backdrop, despite bearish technical signals. The potential for a positive shift in sentiment warrants a moderately positive score.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, though recent price declines suggest caution. The overall sentiment is mixed, but the inflows are a positive sign.

SOL: 0.0 — Security concerns from the supply chain attack offset any potential stabilization. The market is likely to remain cautious until more clarity is provided.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite volatility, the potential for a 'Santa Rally' and bullish analyst expectations provide a slight positive outlook. However, the recent price swings suggest caution.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent for risk management, though the overall market environment does not strongly favor USDT."
2024-12-02 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with some positive developments and ongoing uncertainties. Bitcoin continues to see strong institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which may provide a supportive backdrop for BTC. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, but recent price declines suggest short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin shows potential for a bullish rally, though it remains volatile. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a cautious but not overly defensive market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ETF developments are positive, but technical indicators remain neutral. A moderate buy signal reflects the potential for upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence. The score reflects cautious optimism given mixed technicals.

SOL: 0.0 — The supply chain attack introduces risk, counterbalancing potential price stabilization. A neutral score reflects the need for caution until more clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and increased on-chain activity provide a slightly positive outlook, though volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With mixed signals across other assets, maintaining some exposure to USDT for stability is prudent, but the overall risk appetite suggests reducing stablecoin holdings slightly."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's sentiment is bolstered by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, suggesting institutional interest. Ethereum has seen significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest, despite recent price declines. Solana faces technical challenges due to a supply chain attack but is expected to stabilize within a defined price range. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" while Tether remains stable without significant news. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward momentum in specific assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive news from institutional investments and ETF options support a bullish outlook, despite technical indicators showing no immediate buy signals.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows suggest investor confidence, though recent price declines warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite technical issues, the price is expected to stabilize, and no immediate buy signals are present.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish news and recent price increases indicate potential for further gains, aligning with the ""Santa Rally"" narrative.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-12-02 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin seeing positive news from institutional interest and new ETF options, which could drive further investment. Ethereum is witnessing strong fund inflows, although recent price momentum has been negative. Solana faces some technical challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends with potential for a significant rally, driven by positive sentiment. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and new ETF options provide a strong bullish case, despite technical indicators not yet signaling a buy. The news of continued accumulation by MicroStrategy further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest. The overall sentiment is mixed, but the inflows suggest potential for recovery.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent supply chain attack introduces uncertainty, but analysts expect price stabilization. Given the mixed signals, a neutral stance is prudent.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" suggest bullish momentum. The recent price increase and high transaction activity support a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive sentiment in the broader crypto market, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets."
2024-12-02 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of bullish momentum, particularly supported by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum is experiencing strong investor interest with significant fund inflows, although it has faced recent price pressure. Solana has been affected by a security incident, but analysts expect price stabilization within a defined range. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend, with potential for further gains as analysts predict a 'Santa Rally.' The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a moderate risk appetite, which might encourage some capital rotation from stablecoins to more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The combination of bullish momentum, strong on-chain activity, and supportive news from MicroStrategy and ETF options suggests a favorable outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price pressure, strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest, warranting a moderately positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent security incident and mixed price signals suggest a cautious approach, with no strong directional bias at this time.

DOGE: +0.6 — Volatile uptrend and positive sentiment around a potential 'Santa Rally' justify a moderately bullish stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall positive sentiment and potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent."
2024-12-02 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals and some volatility. Bitcoin shows signs of institutional interest with MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could support future price increases despite recent price decreases. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, but recent price declines suggest short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts predict price stabilization within a broad range. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" though recent price swings suggest caution. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward movement in some assets, but also risk factors that warrant careful allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ETF-related news are positive, but recent price declines suggest caution. Maintain a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, but recent price drops require a balanced approach. Slightly positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical risks from the supply chain attack offset potential price stabilization. Hold current position without increasing exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent analyst optimism suggest a slight positive bias, but volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive sentiment in risk assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential upward movements in other assets."
2024-12-02 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bullish tilt, driven by positive developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest, highlighted by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could drive further demand. Ethereum is seeing significant fund inflows, indicating robust investor interest despite recent price declines. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization within a defined range. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends, with potential for a ""Santa Rally"" to push prices higher. The macroeconomic context suggests a stable environment with moderate volatility, which may support risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF-related developments are likely to drive further demand, supported by bullish momentum signals.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, significant fund inflows indicate strong investor interest, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — While facing potential risks from a supply chain attack, the expected price stabilization suggests a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.2 — Volatile uptrends and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" provide a slight positive outlook, but the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-12-02 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment displays a mixed sentiment with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has seen significant institutional interest, highlighted by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide a supportive backdrop for BTC. Ethereum, despite leading in fund inflows, has experienced a recent price drop due to momentum loss, indicating short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces potential headwinds from a security breach in its development ecosystem, although analysts expect price stabilization within a broad range. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile price movements with potential for a bullish rally, while Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and new ETF options provide a supportive environment, despite recent price declines. The bullish momentum signal suggests potential recovery.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor interest, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — The security breach poses risks, but expected price stabilization suggests a neutral position until further clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.3 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and recent price volatility suggest a modest positive outlook, though risks remain.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for bullish moves in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is reasonable to capitalize on riskier assets."
2024-12-02 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish developments such as MicroStrategy's continued BTC accumulation and significant inflows into ETH funds, indicating strong investor interest. However, technical indicators for most assets remain bearish, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals generally not supportive of bullish trends. Notably, DOGE shows potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" suggesting possible short-term gains. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a moderate risk environment, but the high U.S. Dollar Index could exert downward pressure on crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite bearish technical indicators, the strong institutional interest and ETF-related news provide a supportive backdrop for potential gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant fund inflows indicate strong investor interest, although recent price drops and bearish technicals suggest caution.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent security concern in the Solana ecosystem and lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.6 — Positive news regarding potential bullish momentum and a possible ""Santa Rally"" make DOGE attractive for short-term gains.

USDT: -0.3 — With a moderate risk environment and some bullish signals in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of potential growth assets is advisable."
2024-12-02 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin's market activity remains stable, supported by positive news such as MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide a bullish backdrop. Ethereum has seen significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest, but recent price drops suggest short-term bearish momentum. Solana faces potential risks due to a supply chain attack, although analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin shows signs of a potential rally, driven by bullish sentiment and volatile price movements. The macroeconomic context, with relatively low volatility and stable commodity prices, suggests a cautious market environment, potentially favoring stablecoins like USDT for risk-averse investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, positive news from institutional adoption and ETF options support a moderate bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows and bullish momentum in the last hour suggest potential for recovery, despite recent price declines.

SOL: 0.0 — The supply chain attack introduces uncertainty, offsetting any potential bullish sentiment from price stabilization forecasts.

DOGE: +0.4 — Bullish momentum and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" provide a positive outlook, despite recent volatility.

USDT: -0.2 — While the macro environment remains cautious, the potential for bullish moves in other assets suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."
2024-12-02 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a risk-on sentiment in broader markets. Bitcoin is seeing positive momentum, bolstered by significant institutional interest and new financial products like ETF options. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, although recent price drops indicate some short-term bearish sentiment. Solana is facing technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts predict price stabilization within a broad range. Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential bullish rally, with analysts forecasting a possible price surge. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and new ETF options provide a bullish outlook. Positive momentum and on-chain activity support further capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest. However, short-term bearish sentiment tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical issues and a recent attack on its ecosystem create uncertainty, offsetting any potential price stabilization predictions.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a 'Santa Rally' suggest upside potential. However, volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the risk-on sentiment and positive developments in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
