2024-11-26 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K as indicated by weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum, however, shows some bullish sentiment with record-high open interest in derivatives, suggesting increased trader activity. Solana is under pressure due to a major sell-off and a broader market correction, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp drop, is seeing some bullish sentiment due to new financial products and perceived buying opportunities. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price declines and bearish news, Bitcoin's high transaction activity suggests some underlying interest, but caution is warranted due to potential further downside.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's strong derivatives activity and regained status as the leading USDT network indicate bullish sentiment, making it relatively attractive in the current market.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's recent price drop and significant whale sell-off create bearish pressure, but the asset's ecosystem potential warrants a cautious approach rather than a strong sell.

DOGE: +0.2 — The launch of a Dogecoin ETP and some bullish sentiment among traders provide a slight positive outlook, despite recent price volatility.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide flexibility for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns about weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on its network, indicating strong trader activity. Solana has faced a notable price drop due to a broader market correction and a significant whale sell-off, raising bearish pressure. Dogecoin, despite a recent sharp drop, has seen a positive development with the launch of a DOGE ETP, suggesting some bullish sentiment among traders. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and a strong U.S. dollar index, which may contribute to cautious trading behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and profit-taking suggest caution, especially with potential downside risks highlighted by analysts.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong derivatives activity and bullish sentiment from increased USDT supply on Ethereum support a positive outlook.

SOL: -0.3 — Price drop and significant whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure; however, watch for support at $200.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price decline, the launch of a DOGE ETP and trader optimism provide a slight bullish tilt.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of market uncertainty and potential downside in other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent."
2024-11-26 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant corrections observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin's recent drop from near $100K levels has sparked concerns of further downside, especially with weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on its network, suggesting strong trader activity. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a major sell-off and broader market corrections, while Dogecoin's recent price drop is seen as a potential buying opportunity by some traders. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high U.S. dollar index and stable gold prices, indicates a cautious market environment, favoring stability over risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent significant price drop and bearish news suggest further downside risk. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price stability, strong derivative activity and increased USDT supply indicate potential upward momentum.

SOL: -0.3 — Major sell-off and bearish sentiment, coupled with no current holdings, suggest caution.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite recent price drop, some bullish sentiment exists, but current holdings warrant a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish market sentiment and current holdings, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides stability and liquidity."
2024-11-26 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of profit-taking and bearish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing the $100K mark, coupled with warnings of further downside, indicates a potential cooling off period. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on its network. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off and market correction, while Dogecoin's recent ETP launch in the Nordics hasn't offset its price decline, though some traders remain optimistic. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amidst volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility and bearish news, the absence of a current holding and mixed signals suggest a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive developments in derivatives and USDT supply indicate bullish sentiment, justifying a moderate buy signal given current holdings.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure, but without current holdings, a neutral stance is maintained.

DOGE: -0.3 — Despite some bullish sentiment, the significant price drop and low on-chain activity warrant a cautious reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the market's cautious tone and potential for further downside in other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent."
2024-11-26 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with a notable pullback in Bitcoin after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K as indicated by a price gap between major exchanges. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale, while Dogecoin's recent ETP launch in the Nordics provides a positive development despite a recent price drop. The macroeconomic context suggests a stable environment with low volatility, but the high U.S. dollar index and elevated gold prices indicate a preference for safe-haven assets, which could impact riskier crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution, especially with no current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.5 — Record open interest and regained top spot for USDT supply on Ethereum indicate strong market interest and potential upside.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a recent price drop and whale sell-off, the market correction may provide a buying opportunity, but caution is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the ETP launch, the recent price drop and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of potential market volatility and a cautious macroeconomic environment, maintaining liquidity in USDT is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over a potential dip below $90K. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although its price has been relatively stable. Solana is under pressure due to a major sell-off and a broader market correction, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp decline, has seen some positive sentiment with the launch of a new ETP. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a risk-off environment, which could lead to higher allocations in stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not attractive for new allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate bullish sentiment, making it a relatively attractive asset to hold and potentially increase.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent price drop and bearish pressure from a whale sell-off, no current holdings to reduce. Awaiting clearer signals before considering new allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although there is some bullish sentiment with the ETP launch, the recent price drop and low on-chain activity suggest holding the current position without increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — In a cautious market environment with potential downside risks, maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-11-26 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable drop after approaching the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns about weakening demand. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment in the derivatives market, yet its price remains under pressure. Solana and Dogecoin have both faced significant declines, with Solana impacted by a large whale sell-off and Dogecoin seeing a sharp drop despite some bullish trader sentiment. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market volatility. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by high interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a more risk-averse market stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside amid profit-taking and weakening demand suggest caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite price pressure, rising open interest and bullish sentiment in derivatives indicate potential upside.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drop and bearish pressure from whale sell-off warrant reduced exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent price drop but some bullish sentiment; maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the market's cautious tone and potential for further downside in risk assets, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-11-26 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price corrections across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent drop from near $100K has led to profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, with analysts predicting potential further declines. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment in derivatives markets, but recent price action remains mixed. Solana faces pressure from a significant sell-off, while Dogecoin's recent decline is viewed by some as a buying opportunity. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further decline suggest caution. No current holdings allow for a neutral stance, but the market sentiment is bearish.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price decreases, the record open interest in derivatives suggests underlying bullish sentiment, warranting a slight positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off create uncertainty. Without current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

DOGE: +0.1 — Despite the recent price drop, the launch of a Dogecoin ETP and some bullish sentiment suggest a minor positive allocation.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-11-26 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop after approaching the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection. Ethereum, while seeing a surge in derivatives activity, is also facing downward pressure, with its price breaking below key technical levels. Solana and Dogecoin have both seen significant declines, exacerbated by large sell-offs and broader market weakness. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite previous bullish momentum, the recent sharp decline and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not a favorable buy.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with strong derivatives activity but recent price weakness and technical breakdown. Holding current position without increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Significant price drop presents a potential buying opportunity, but caution is warranted due to weak ecosystem performance and large sell-offs.

DOGE: -0.3 — Recent significant price decrease and technical breakdown below lower Bollinger Band suggest reducing exposure. Current holdings allow for a negative score.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of bearish conditions across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening demand. Ethereum, despite bullish derivatives activity, is facing technical breakdowns, while Solana is under pressure from large sell-offs and a broader market correction. Dogecoin, although experiencing a sharp decline, has seen some optimism due to new financial products. In this environment, USDT remains stable, reflecting a cautious approach as investors seek safety amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drops and bearish news suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction possible, but not a preferred buy.

ETH: -0.2 — Despite bullish derivatives activity, technical indicators and price action are weak. Hold existing position but avoid increasing exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price decline and whale sell-off indicate bearish sentiment. Reduce exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the price drop, new financial products and some bullish sentiment provide a mixed outlook. Hold current position.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining or increasing stablecoin exposure is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2024-11-26 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop after approaching the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a perceived weakening in U.S. demand. Ethereum, while seeing a record in derivatives open interest, is also under pressure, trading below key technical levels. Solana and Dogecoin have both seen significant sell-offs, with Solana facing additional bearish pressure from a whale's large sell order. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not favorable for new allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price weakness, the record open interest in derivatives indicates potential bullish sentiment. Maintain current holdings with a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and bearish sentiment from large sell-offs warrant caution. Reduce exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite some bullish sentiment, the sharp price decline and lack of strong technical support suggest reducing exposure.

USDT: +0.8 — Market volatility and bearish conditions make USDT an attractive safe haven, warranting increased allocation to preserve capital."
2024-11-26 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent drop after approaching the $100K mark indicates profit-taking and a potential weakening in demand, as suggested by the price gap between Coinbase and Binance. Ethereum, despite a record surge in derivatives open interest, is experiencing a price breakdown, reflecting cautious trader sentiment. Solana is facing downward pressure due to a major sell-off and broader market corrections, while Dogecoin's recent decline is seen by some as a buying opportunity despite the launch of a new ETP. In contrast, USDT remains stable with no significant news, suggesting its continued role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. The lack of bullish technical signals supports a reduced exposure stance.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the price breakdown, the record open interest in derivatives indicates underlying bullish sentiment. A slight increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price decline and bearish pressure from a major sell-off suggest reducing exposure until stability is observed.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with recent price drop and new ETP launch. Maintain current holdings without increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT as a stable asset is prudent to manage risk."
2024-11-26 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K indicates profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, with analysts warning of further potential declines. Ethereum shows mixed signals with a record open interest in derivatives, suggesting bullish sentiment, yet its price remains under pressure. Solana has experienced a substantial sell-off, contributing to bearish pressure, while Dogecoin, despite a recent drop, has seen some bullish sentiment due to new market access through an ETP. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a cautious approach, with USDT remaining a safe haven amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant price drop and potential for further downside suggest reducing exposure, especially with no current holdings.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite bearish price action, the record open interest and USDT supply increase on Ethereum indicate potential bullish sentiment, warranting a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.3 — The large sell-off and bearish market conditions suggest reducing exposure, especially given current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent price drop but some bullish sentiment due to new ETP access; maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and reduce risk."
2024-11-26 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening demand. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in its derivatives market, although it is still affected by the broader market correction. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a major sell-off, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp decline, has some traders viewing it as a buying opportunity. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stability over aggressive risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent price increase, the overall sentiment remains bearish due to profit-taking and potential further downside. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.2 — Record open interest and rising trader activity suggest a potential for recovery, but caution is warranted due to broader market conditions.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant sell-off and bearish pressure indicate a need to reduce exposure, especially given current holdings.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite some bullish sentiment, the recent sharp decline and lack of strong recovery signals suggest a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins provides a buffer against volatility and potential further downside in other assets."
2024-11-26 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and SOL. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K has raised concerns about potential further downside, especially with analysts warning of weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum, however, shows some bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale, while Dogecoin's recent price drop is seen by some as a buying opportunity, despite broader market weakness. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach, with potential capital rotation into stablecoins like USDT as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and warnings of further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not attractive for new allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price decrease, record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate positive sentiment and potential for recovery.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent price drop and new ETP launch. No clear direction for allocation change.

USDT: +0.5 — With market uncertainty and potential downside in other assets, increasing stablecoin exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2024-11-26 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently mixed, with some bullish momentum observed in price movements, particularly for BTC and ETH, despite recent corrections and profit-taking. Bitcoin's approach to $100K was met with resistance, leading to a pullback, while Ethereum's derivatives market shows strong trader interest, indicating potential bullish sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced notable price declines due to broader market corrections and specific sell-offs, yet some traders remain optimistic about Dogecoin's potential. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach, with volatility remaining relatively low.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent profit-taking and potential downside risks, the bullish momentum and high transaction activity suggest a cautious buy opportunity.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate bullish sentiment, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure, suggesting a cautious approach to maintaining current exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent price volatility and new ETP launch; maintain current holdings without increasing exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With some bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, consider reducing stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential upward movements in other assets."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with significant volatility and recent corrections across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K highlights profit-taking and a potential weakening in U.S. demand, as suggested by the price gap between major exchanges. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, but the broader market weakness tempers enthusiasm. Solana faces bearish pressure from a significant whale sell-off, while Dogecoin's launch of an ETP in the Nordics provides some positive sentiment despite recent price declines. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. Profit-taking and weakening demand indicators warrant reducing exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Record open interest and bullish sentiment in derivatives markets indicate potential upside, making it relatively attractive despite broader market weakness.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant sell-off by a whale and price drop suggest bearish pressure, though the potential for support at $200 could provide a floor.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price decline, the launch of a Dogecoin ETP and bullish sentiment among traders present a buying opportunity.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of market volatility and potential downside risks in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins provides a defensive position."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows relatively stable conditions with a low volatility index (VIX) and a strong U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which may exert pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has recently experienced a significant drop after approaching the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential weakening in U.S. demand. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with a record open interest in derivatives, although its price has been slightly volatile. Solana is under pressure due to a significant whale sell-off, while Dogecoin's recent launch of an ETP in the Nordics has not prevented its price from falling sharply. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, recent price drops and potential further downside suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.2 — Rising open interest and bullish sentiment in derivatives markets indicate potential upside, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant sell-off pressure and a bearish market outlook suggest reducing exposure to mitigate potential losses.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent price drop but some bullish sentiment among traders. Hold current position without changes.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets and the strong USD, increasing stablecoin exposure is prudent to preserve capital and reduce risk."
2024-11-26 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with recent price corrections across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC and SOL, while ETH shows signs of increased trader activity. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K suggests profit-taking and potential downside risks, as analysts warn of further declines. Ethereum's derivatives market indicates bullish sentiment, although its price has been volatile. Solana has faced significant selling pressure, with a notable whale sell-off contributing to its decline. Dogecoin remains volatile, with a recent ETP launch in the Nordics providing some positive sentiment despite a sharp price drop. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, which could support risk-taking in the near term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the significant price drop and potential for further downside suggest reducing exposure to manage risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Rising open interest and bullish sentiment in derivatives markets indicate potential for upside, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — The recent whale sell-off and broader market correction create bearish pressure, suggesting a cautious approach with reduced exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent ETP launch and price drop; maintain current holdings without significant changes.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the potential for further market corrections, increasing stablecoin exposure provides a hedge against volatility and downside risk."
2024-11-26 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and SOL indicating potential bearish trends. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, suggesting profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and a resurgence in USDT supply on its network. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a major sell-off and broader market correction. Dogecoin, despite a sharp drop, maintains some bullish sentiment with the launch of a new ETP. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady indicators, but the high U.S. dollar index could weigh on crypto prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside as indicated by news and technical signals suggest reducing exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment from record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a moderate buy signal.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and bearish news from whale sell-off indicate caution and a need to reduce exposure slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent volatility, the launch of a new ETP and mixed sentiment suggest holding the current position.

USDT: +0.5 — With potential bearish trends in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin exposure is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-11-26 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with recent price corrections across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and SOL. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K indicates profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K, as suggested by analysts. Ethereum, however, shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and a resurgence in USDT supply on its network. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off and a broader market correction. Dogecoin, despite a sharp drop, maintains some bullish sentiment due to new financial products and potential buying opportunities. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could influence risk-averse behavior and favor stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the potential for further downside and profit-taking suggests caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment from record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.4 — Recent price drop and significant sell-off by a whale indicate bearish pressure. Reducing exposure is prudent given current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent price drop but some bullish sentiment due to new financial products. Hold current position.

USDT: +0.4 — With potential market volatility and bearish signals in other assets, maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin holdings is advisable for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable decline after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K suggested by analysts. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and a significant increase in USDT supply on its network, indicating strong trader activity. Solana is under pressure from a major sell-off and a broader market correction, while Dogecoin, despite a recent drop, sees some optimism with the launch of a new ETP. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with low volatility, suggesting a cautious but stable environment for crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and bearish news sentiment suggest caution. Analysts warn of further downside, and current holdings justify reducing exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment from record derivatives open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicates potential upside, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and bearish pressure from a whale sell-off suggest reducing exposure, especially given current holdings.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price drop, the launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment provide a slight positive outlook, justifying a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.2 — In light of mixed market conditions and potential downside in major assets, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation for risk management is prudent."
2024-11-26 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns about weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although its price remains relatively stable. Solana is under pressure from a major sell-off and broader market correction, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp price drop, is buoyed by the launch of a new ETP, suggesting some bullish sentiment. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and no significant changes in traditional financial indicators, which might support a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and bearish news suggest caution. Potential for further downside as analysts warn of a dip below $90K.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment from record derivatives open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum. However, price stability suggests moderate allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — Price under pressure from a major whale sell-off and broader market correction. Watch for key support at $200.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price drop, the launch of a Dogecoin ETP and continued bullish sentiment among traders suggest a moderate buy signal.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of market volatility and potential downside in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT for stability and liquidity is prudent."
2024-11-27 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with signs of bullish momentum across several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding after a recent dip and nearing the $100K mark again, which has helped stabilize the broader market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to gain traction, with its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, indicating strong support and potential for further price appreciation. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired, reflecting regulatory adjustments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's rebound and stabilization efforts, coupled with renewed bullish sentiment, suggest a favorable environment for further gains. The recent market stabilization is a positive sign.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's strong futures interest and increased activity indicate robust market confidence, supporting a positive allocation despite recent price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's strong on-chain and derivatives data, along with its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, highlight its growing market presence and potential for further upside.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is approaching a key resistance level, its market cap growth and speculative interest provide some support for a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted, although USDT remains a key liquidity anchor."
2024-11-27 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again, and Ethereum showing significant bullish momentum with record futures open interest. Solana is also experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by high DEX volumes surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin has been buoyed by market cap growth and speculation, although it faces key resistance at $0.40. Meanwhile, Tether's dominance in the stablecoin market remains strong, but there is a notable shift in focus as the stablecoin market cap grows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, along with significant market support, suggest a favorable environment for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and record futures open interest indicate strong market confidence, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new highs and strong on-chain and derivatives support, along with leading DEX volumes, make it a compelling asset to increase exposure to.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin faces resistance at $0.40, its market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderate bullish signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stablecoin market that remains strong but stable, there is no immediate need to allocate capital to USDT."
2024-11-27 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several key cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin has rebounded sharply after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is also experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest reaching record levels, indicating growing market confidence. Solana continues to rally, driven by strong on-chain and derivatives data, and has seen significant activity on decentralized exchanges. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap growth fueled by speculation and high-profile endorsements. Meanwhile, Tether remains the dominant stablecoin, but with no significant bullish signals, it may see reduced demand as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and strong market support suggest continued upward momentum. The recent news of a massive BTC position stabilizing the market further supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong futures activity and bullish momentum indicate potential for further gains. The growing market confidence is a positive signal for ETH.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's rally and high DEX volume highlight strong market interest and potential for continued price appreciation. The asset remains attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE is testing a key resistance level, the lack of clear directional signals and mixed sentiment suggest a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and strong bullish signals in other assets, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-11-27 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of recovery and renewed optimism. Bitcoin has rebounded from a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has bolstered market confidence. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to perform well, driven by high DEX volumes and positive price action. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, supported by market speculation and high-profile endorsements. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, but the focus is shifting away from euro-denominated stablecoins as regulatory landscapes evolve.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's rebound and bullish sentiment, along with strong on-chain activity, suggest a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's strong bullish momentum, record futures interest, and price breakout signal a high confidence level for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive price action and high DEX volume indicate strong support, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the market cap boost and positive sentiment provide a moderate buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral. Despite increased supply, the current market environment favors risk assets over stablecoins."
2024-11-27 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark again, supported by a massive position that stabilized the market after a recent sell-off. Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels, reflecting growing market confidence. Solana is experiencing a rally, driven by strong on-chain and derivatives support, while Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level amid increased market cap and speculation. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with a slight increase in supply reinforcing its dominance in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with renewed optimism after a recent dip. The news of a massive position stabilizing the market further supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.9 — Ethereum's strong bullish momentum, record futures open interest, and increased activity indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's rally towards new highs and significant DEX volume support a positive allocation, reflecting strong market interest and potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's approach to a key resistance level, combined with increased market cap and positive sentiment, suggests potential for further gains, albeit with some caution due to resistance.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the stablecoin market's growth, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining a neutral position in USDT, as capital is likely to rotate into more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed investor confidence. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures interest and on-chain activity, indicating strong market confidence. Solana continues its upward trajectory, supported by high DEX volumes and positive on-chain data, while Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by speculative interest. In contrast, USDT remains stable but is seeing increased supply, reflecting its continued dominance in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with renewed investor confidence and significant market support, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's strong futures interest and increased on-chain activity suggest robust market confidence, supporting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong rally and high DEX volumes indicate continued bullish sentiment, warranting an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderate positive signal.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in allocation, serving as a liquidity reserve amidst bullish conditions in other assets."
2024-11-27 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a massive position that stabilized the market. Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum, with record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana is experiencing a rally, driven by high on-chain and derivatives data, and its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, boosted by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, Tether remains a dominant force in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and strong support from large positions indicate a bullish trend, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Record futures open interest and increased activity suggest strong market confidence, warranting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's rally and impressive DEX volume highlight its potential for further growth, supporting a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and speculation provide a moderate bullish signal.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite its dominance in the stablecoin market, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining a neutral position in USDT."
2024-11-27 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, indicating renewed investor confidence. Ethereum is also experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest reaching record levels, suggesting increased market confidence. Solana is showing robust growth, driven by high on-chain activity and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, indicating strong support and potential for further gains. Dogecoin's market cap has surged, driven by speculation and nearing a key resistance level, while Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, reflecting its continued importance as a liquidity anchor.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with bullish news and technical indicators. The recent rebound and large market position suggest continued confidence in BTC.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is experiencing significant bullish momentum with record futures interest and increased on-chain activity, indicating strong market confidence.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong price performance and high DEX volume suggest continued bullish sentiment, supported by positive on-chain and derivatives data.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Dogecoin's market cap growth and proximity to key resistance suggest potential for further gains, albeit with caution.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral. While it plays a crucial role in liquidity, current market conditions favor risk assets, reducing the need for stablecoin exposure."
2024-11-27 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip and nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed optimism among investors. Ethereum also shows strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels, indicating growing market confidence. Solana continues to perform well, reaching new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by speculation and increased market cap. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin, as the focus shifts under evolving EU regulations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with significant market stabilization efforts, suggest a positive outlook. The technical indicators also support further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased activity signal strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new highs and impressive DEX volume highlight its strong market position and potential for further growth, supported by positive technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the increased market cap and speculation provide a moderate positive outlook, though with some caution due to potential volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bullish market sentiment, there is no immediate need to allocate capital to USDT, maintaining a neutral stance."
2024-11-27 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with major cryptocurrencies showing strong upward momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong market confidence and optimism. Solana is also performing well, reaching new highs with significant support from on-chain activity and DEX volumes surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there is a notable shift in focus due to regulatory changes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong recovery and bullish momentum, with positive news supporting its upward trajectory. The recent rebound and stabilization efforts indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's strong futures interest and increased activity signal robust market confidence, making it an attractive asset to allocate more capital towards.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price breakout and high DEX volume highlight its strong market position and potential for continued growth, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the positive sentiment and market cap growth provide a moderate buy signal, though caution is advised due to potential volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the market showing bullish sentiment, there is no immediate need to increase USDT exposure. Maintaining a neutral stance allows for flexibility in reallocating capital to other assets."
2024-11-27 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a substantial $15 trillion position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong bullish momentum and increased market confidence. Solana continues to rally, driven by high on-chain activity and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level at $0.40, with market cap comparisons to major corporations like Porsche. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum with significant on-chain activity and positive news sentiment. The recent rebound and stabilization efforts suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with record futures open interest and increased activity. The positive sentiment supports further capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is showing strong upward momentum with a potential breakout, supported by high DEX volume and positive news. It remains an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level with positive market sentiment and significant on-chain activity. While not as strong as other assets, it still presents an opportunity for gains.

USDT: 0.0 — With the current bullish market sentiment, there is no immediate need to hold USDT. However, maintaining a neutral stance allows flexibility for future market shifts."
2024-11-27 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark again, driven by renewed bullish sentiment and a massive position stabilizing the market after a recent sell-off. Ethereum is experiencing record futures open interest, indicating strong market confidence, while Solana continues to rally with robust on-chain and derivatives support, even surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap growth fueled by speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin, EURt.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with price nearing $100K and significant market stabilization efforts. On-chain activity supports further upside.

ETH: +0.7 — Record futures open interest and increased activity signal strong bullish sentiment and potential for further price appreciation.

SOL: +0.9 — New highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight strong market interest and potential for continued growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with potential for breakout, supported by speculative interest and market cap growth.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite strong market dominance, current bullish conditions in other assets suggest maintaining a neutral stance on stablecoins."
2024-11-27 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum. Bitcoin has rebounded significantly, nearing the $100K mark, supported by a massive position that has stabilized the market after a recent sell-off. Ethereum is also experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong bullish momentum and renewed market confidence. Solana continues to gain traction, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there is a notable shift in focus due to regulatory changes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and a significant rebound in price, supported by positive news and market sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum with record futures open interest and increased market activity, indicating strong investor confidence.

SOL: +0.7 — Positive price action and high DEX volume, supported by strong on-chain and derivatives data, suggest continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance levels with positive news support, but potential for reversal warrants a cautious approach.

2024-11-27 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip and nearing the $100K mark again. This recovery has renewed optimism across the crypto market, as evidenced by the strong bullish momentum in Ethereum, which has seen record futures open interest. Solana continues its upward trajectory, driven by high DEX volumes and positive on-chain data, while Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level amid market cap gains. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although the focus is shifting due to regulatory changes in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong recovery and bullish momentum, supported by significant market interventions and renewed investor confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased activity signal strong bullish momentum, making it attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's strong price performance and high DEX volume indicate robust market interest, supporting further capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's market cap growth and testing of resistance levels suggest potential for upward movement, though with more caution compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in the market, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-11-27 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This recovery is supported by a significant $15 trillion Bitcoin position that stabilized the market following a large sell-off. Ethereum is also showing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels, indicating growing market confidence. Solana continues its upward trajectory, setting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, with market cap growth fueled by speculation and high-profile endorsements. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong recovery and bullish sentiment, supported by significant market stabilization efforts. Positive news flow and technical indicators suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Record futures open interest and increased activity signal strong bullish momentum, making ETH attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — New highs and strong DEX volume indicate robust demand and positive sentiment, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with potential for a breakout, supported by positive market cap developments and speculative interest.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin dominance remains strong, but the current bullish environment suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation."
2024-11-27 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This recovery has renewed optimism across the crypto space, supported by a significant $15 trillion Bitcoin position that stabilized the market after a substantial sell-off. Ethereum is also experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels, indicating growing market confidence. Solana continues to perform well, reaching new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there is a shift in focus due to regulatory changes in the EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and the stabilization of the market with a massive position indicate a renewed bullish sentiment, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased activity suggest strong bullish momentum, warranting a positive allocation score.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new highs and impressive DEX volume highlight its growing strength and potential for further gains, supporting a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and speculative interest provide some upside potential, though with less conviction than other assets.

USDT: 0.0 — As the market sentiment turns bullish, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, given the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with a strong rebound in Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark, supported by significant market stabilization efforts. Ethereum shows robust bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge past $95K, supported by ETF inflows and institutional interest, although there is some cautious sentiment due to the upcoming options expiry. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum with potential targets set higher, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting further gains. Solana is drawing attention with a new ETF filing and significant ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin is experiencing a resurgence in trading volume and price, indicating renewed investor interest. Tether remains stable, with strategic expansions in blockchain integrations despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional interest, supported by ETF inflows, make Bitcoin an attractive asset despite the upcoming options expiry.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, driven by ETF inflows and positive technical indicators, support a strong allocation to Ethereum.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments with ETF filing and significant ecosystem growth indicate strong investor confidence and potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Renewed investor interest and significant trading volume increase suggest potential for further gains, making Dogecoin an attractive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With a bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as capital is likely to rotate into more volatile assets."
2024-11-28 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant ETF inflows and strong institutional interest, particularly in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent price surge past $95K and Ethereum's break above $3,600 highlight the positive momentum. Solana is also gaining traction with increased TVL and ETF interest, while Dogecoin is experiencing a resurgence in trading volume and price. However, the macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could temper some of the bullish enthusiasm. Tether's expansion into the TON blockchain indicates ongoing efforts to enhance liquidity and accessibility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and ETF inflows support a bullish outlook. The upcoming options expiry may introduce some volatility, but overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains driven by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by the ETF filing and TVL increase, make Solana an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.5 — Renewed investor interest and significant trading volume increase suggest potential for further upside, though caution is warranted given its speculative nature.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as capital is better allocated to growth assets."
2024-11-28 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by ETF inflows and positive price action. Bitcoin's recent surge past $95K, bolstered by institutional interest, and Ethereum's push beyond $3,600 indicate strong market confidence. Solana also shows promising growth with increased TVL and ETF interest, while Dogecoin's trading volume and price have seen significant spikes, suggesting renewed investor interest. However, the macroeconomic backdrop remains mixed, with stable oil prices and a relatively low volatility index, which may temper aggressive risk-taking. The U.S. dollar index remains strong, which could pose a headwind for further gains in crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and positive price action suggest continued upward momentum. The upcoming options expiry could introduce volatility, but overall sentiment remains bullish.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators pointing to a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest via ETF filing and significant ecosystem growth enhance its attractiveness, despite recent price fluctuations.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price predictions indicate potential for further upside, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT serves as a neutral holding. Current market conditions do not strongly favor a shift towards or away from stablecoins."
2024-11-28 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving price surges in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent price surge past $95K, fueled by ETF inflows, indicates strong institutional backing, although the impending expiry of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as it targets $4,000 and beyond. Solana is gaining traction with a new ETF filing and substantial ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin sees renewed interest with a significant increase in trading volume. Meanwhile, Tether's strategic moves, including discontinuing EURT and launching USDT on the TON blockchain, reflect its focus on maintaining relevance and liquidity in the market.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and ETF inflows suggest potential for further price increases, with technical indicators pointing towards a possible climb to $4,500.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments with the Solana ETF filing and significant TVL growth indicate strong investor confidence and potential for price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed investor interest and a significant increase in trading volume suggest potential upside, although the asset remains speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, USDT remains neutral as a stablecoin amidst a market environment favoring risk assets."
2024-11-28 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price surges in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, bolstered by significant ETF inflows, although the impending expiry of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum has also shown bullish momentum, with analysts predicting further gains. Solana is experiencing increased institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by a new ETF filing and a substantial rise in total value locked. Dogecoin's trading volume has skyrocketed, indicating renewed investor interest, while Tether continues to expand its reach despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving Bitcoin's price upwards, despite some caution around options expiry. The overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with ETF inflows and potential for further gains, supported by technical indicators and analyst predictions.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's ecosystem growth and institutional interest, highlighted by the ETF filing and TVL increase, make it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — The significant increase in trading volume and optimistic price predictions suggest potential upside, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

2024-11-28 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of bullish momentum driven by ETF inflows and strong institutional interest. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, and Ethereum has broken the $3,600 mark, with analysts predicting further potential gains. Solana is experiencing increased attention due to a new ETF filing and significant ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin has seen a substantial increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and moderate interest rates, suggesting a conducive environment for risk assets. However, the presence of significant Bitcoin options expiry and cautious market sentiment could introduce some volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Bitcoin is benefiting from strong institutional inflows and ETF-related news, indicating potential for further price appreciation. However, the upcoming options expiry introduces some caution.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further gains, as highlighted by analysts, make it an attractive asset, though the market remains cautious.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments such as the ETF filing and robust ecosystem growth support a favorable outlook for Solana, despite recent price fluctuations.

DOGE: +0.3 — The significant increase in trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the current market conditions and the absence of USDT holdings, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent as risk appetite appears to be increasing."
2024-11-28 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish developments for Bitcoin and Ethereum driven by ETF inflows and institutional interest. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K is supported by significant ETF inflows, although the upcoming expiry of $13.6 billion in Bitcoin options suggests some market caution. Ethereum has broken past $3,600, with potential to reach $4,500, fueled by strong buying pressure and ETF inflows. Solana is experiencing growing institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by a new ETF filing and a 48% increase in total value locked. Dogecoin is seeing renewed investor interest with a significant increase in trading volume, although its future price predictions remain speculative. Tether continues to expand its reach despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and institutional interest are driving Bitcoin's price upward. Despite the cautious sentiment due to options expiry, the overall momentum remains positive.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from bullish momentum and ETF inflows, with technical indicators suggesting potential for further gains towards $4,500.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as indicated by the ETF filing and TVL increase, support a positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and renewed investor interest provide a moderate positive signal, though speculative future price predictions warrant caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With risk appetite increasing and capital rotating into more volatile assets, holding USDT is less attractive in the current market environment."
2024-11-28 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, bolstered by ETF inflows and strong institutional interest, although the impending expiry of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as it targets $4,000 and possibly $4,500. Solana is seeing increased institutional interest and ecosystem growth, highlighted by a new ETF filing and a 48% increase in total value locked. Dogecoin's trading volume has skyrocketed, indicating renewed investor interest and potential for substantial price gains. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and institutional interest support a bullish outlook, despite cautious sentiment around options expiry. The price surge past $95K indicates robust market confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and ETF inflows suggest potential for further gains, with technical indicators pointing to a possible rise towards $4,500. Positive sentiment and strong buying pressure are supportive.

SOL: +0.5 — Growing institutional interest and a significant increase in total value locked signal strong ecosystem growth, making Solana an attractive investment in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Surging trading volume and optimistic price predictions indicate renewed investor interest, though the lack of a strong technical buy signal suggests a moderate allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, USDT serves as a neutral position. While the market is showing risk appetite, the absence of USDT in the portfolio means no immediate action is needed."
2024-11-28 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum due to significant ETF inflows and bullish price targets. Bitcoin has seen a strong price surge past $95K, driven by ETF inflows and institutional interest, although the upcoming expiry of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with analysts predicting further price increases. Solana is gaining attention due to its ecosystem growth and ETF filing, while Dogecoin's trading volume has surged significantly, indicating renewed investor interest. Tether is expanding its USDT reach, although it faces challenges with its EURT stablecoin.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant increase in trading volume and optimistic price predictions suggest potential for further gains, although the market remains speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in the current environment. It serves as a safe haven but lacks the growth potential of other assets in a bullish market."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment shows mixed signals across the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable price surge, driven by ETF inflows and institutional interest, although the impending expiry of a large volume of options suggests cautious sentiment. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators. Solana is gaining attention due to a new ETF filing and significant ecosystem growth, indicating strong investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, hinting at renewed investor interest, although its price has recently declined. Tether remains stable, with recent developments focusing on expanding its reach through new blockchain integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the cautious sentiment from options expiry, strong ETF inflows and institutional interest support a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, driven by ETF inflows and technical indicators, make ETH attractive.

SOL: +0.4 — Growing institutional interest and robust ecosystem growth suggest a positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — While trading volume has surged, recent price declines and lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased interest in riskier assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL, maintaining a lower exposure to stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-28 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum driven by ETF inflows, suggesting potential upward momentum. Bitcoin's price has recently surged past $95K, supported by ETF inflows and institutional interest, although the upcoming expiry of significant options indicates some market caution. Ethereum has shown bullish momentum with potential targets of $4,000 and beyond, driven by strong buying pressure and ETF inflows. Solana is gaining attention due to a new ETF filing and significant ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. In contrast, Tether remains stable with strategic expansions, though its discontinuation of EURT reflects regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, the strong institutional interest and ETF inflows provide a positive outlook, suggesting potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential price targets above $4,000, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators, make Ethereum attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Growing institutional interest due to the ETF filing and robust ecosystem growth signal positive sentiment, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The significant increase in trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, though the lack of technical buy signals warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the current market optimism and potential for gains in other assets, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent, as it serves as a stable reserve without immediate need for reallocation."
2024-11-28 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the looming options expiry, strong ETF inflows and institutional interest suggest a positive outlook, supporting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, along with strong ETF inflows, make Ethereum an attractive asset for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive indicators, suggesting a favorable environment for Solana.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price predictions indicate potential upside, warranting a moderate buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stablecoin nature, maintain a neutral stance as risk appetite in the market increases."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge past $95K, supported by strong ETF inflows, although the upcoming expiration of $13.6 billion in options indicates some market caution. Ethereum has also broken past $3,600, with bullish momentum suggesting potential for further gains. Solana is seeing increased institutional interest and ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin's trading volume has surged, indicating renewed investor interest. Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive price momentum and strong ETF inflows suggest further upside potential, though caution is warranted due to the upcoming options expiry.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains towards $4,000, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators.

SOL: +0.4 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion, as evidenced by the ETF filing and TVL growth, support a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price projections indicate potential for further gains, though speculative nature warrants a moderate score.

USDT: 0.0 — No current holdings and stablecoin nature; maintain neutrality as risk appetite in the market appears to be increasing."
2024-11-28 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's price surge past $95,000, driven by ETF inflows and institutional interest, suggests strong market confidence, although the impending expiry of significant options indicates some caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential targets set higher due to ETF inflows and technical indicators. Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF filing highlight increasing institutional interest, while Dogecoin's trading volume surge reflects renewed investor enthusiasm. In contrast, Tether's recent developments focus on strategic adjustments rather than market sentiment shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving Bitcoin's price higher, indicating continued bullish momentum. The upcoming options expiry is a point of caution, but overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's price is buoyed by bullish momentum and ETF inflows, with technical indicators suggesting potential for further gains. The market sentiment is supportive of continued upward movement.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF filing are positive indicators of institutional interest and confidence in the asset, suggesting potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the recent surge in trading volume and price, the speculative nature of Dogecoin warrants a more cautious approach. However, the renewed interest could lead to short-term gains.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, especially given the broader bullish sentiment across other assets."
2024-11-28 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing significant psychological levels and Ethereum seeing substantial ETF inflows. Bitcoin's recent gains and institutional mining activity suggest a strong bullish sentiment, although technical indicators remain neutral. Ethereum's ETF inflows indicate growing institutional interest, but recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the DeFi space, which is a positive sign for its ecosystem. Dogecoin's massive rally in November reflects speculative interest, but its technical indicators do not support a continued uptrend. Meanwhile, Tether's large minting activity highlights its role in liquidity provision, though recent news about its use in illicit activities could raise regulatory concerns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite neutral technical signals, strong monthly gains and institutional mining activity suggest a continued bullish outlook. However, caution is warranted as it approaches $100K.

ETH: +0.3 — Record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate positive sentiment, though mixed signals from founders suggest some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Resumption of U.S. trading and strong DeFi activity provide a bullish case, supported by positive momentum signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a significant rally, low on-chain activity and lack of technical support suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, holding USDT is less attractive, but it remains a necessary liquidity tool."
2024-11-29 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing significant psychological levels and Ethereum seeing substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi volume surpasses Ethereum, highlighting its growing ecosystem. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by speculative interest and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether remains a critical liquidity provider, despite some negative news regarding its use in illicit activities. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a supportive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and nearing of the $100K mark, coupled with positive mining activity, suggest continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from its founder, the significant ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — The resumption of U.S. trading and impressive DeFi activity position Solana as a strong contender for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While speculative, the massive price rally and upcoming discussions with lawmakers provide a potential catalyst for further gains.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the current market optimism, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as capital is likely to rotate into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark and experiencing its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, although mixed signals from its founder have tempered enthusiasm. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, while Dogecoin's massive rally in November highlights its speculative appeal. Despite these positive developments, macroeconomic indicators such as a high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices suggest a cautious approach may still be warranted. In this context, maintaining a balanced portfolio with some exposure to stablecoins like USDT could be prudent, even as risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news on institutional mining and price gains support a bullish outlook. The potential breakout above the Bollinger Bands further reinforces this view.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are mixed, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a moderate bullish stance is appropriate.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive news from Bitstamp and strong DeFi activity provide a bullish signal, supported by technical indicators showing a potential breakout.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the recent rally, low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm. However, the involvement of high-profile figures like Musk in discussions adds speculative appeal.

USDT: -0.3 — As market sentiment turns bullish, there is a moderate preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, though some exposure is maintained for risk management."
2024-11-29 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant price increases and positive news across several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has shown strong upward momentum, nearing the $100K mark, driven by bullish sentiment and institutional mining activity. Ethereum has experienced substantial ETF inflows, although mixed signals from its founder have introduced some caution. Solana has benefited from renewed trading activity and impressive DeFi volume, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, supported by broader market gains and potential political discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with positive news and technical indicators, suggesting continued growth potential.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite positive ETF inflows, mixed signals from the founder and sideways technicals warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and renewed trading interest in the U.S. support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price gains and potential political support provide a positive outlook, though the asset remains volatile.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, exposure to stablecoins should be reduced."
2024-11-29 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with notable gains across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant rally, nearing $98K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, although recent price movements have been mixed. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, pushing its price higher. Dogecoin has surged significantly, buoyed by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see strong demand, evidenced by large minting activities, although it faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with significant price gains and positive news on institutional mining. The technical indicators support further upside potential.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has seen strong ETF inflows, its technical indicators are neutral. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, warranting a modest positive score.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price is supported by increased DeFi activity and renewed trading opportunities, indicating a favorable environment for further gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite a massive rally, Dogecoin's low on-chain activity suggests caution. However, the potential regulatory discussions could provide further upside.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bullish market environment, there is no immediate need to hold USDT. However, given its role as a stablecoin, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent."
2024-11-29 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $98K and experiencing its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum also saw significant inflows into ETFs, although it faced a slight pullback after reaching a five-month high. Solana is benefiting from renewed trading activity in the U.S. and a surge in DeFi activity, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven by broader crypto gains and potential discussions involving Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by substantial minting activity, although it faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and institutional mining activity, suggests continued bullish sentiment. The technical indicators also support a buy signal.

**ETH: +0.3** — Despite a slight pullback, Ethereum's record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate a positive outlook, although caution is warranted due to mixed signals from its founder.

**SOL: +0.6** — Solana's re-enabled trading in the U.S. and impressive DeFi activity provide strong bullish signals, making it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

**DOGE: +0.2** — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential regulatory discussions provide some bullish sentiment, but the low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

**USDT: -0.5** — With the market showing a strong risk-on sentiment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing significant psychological levels and Ethereum experiencing substantial ETF inflows. Bitcoin's strong monthly performance and institutional mining activity suggest robust interest, although recent price decreases may indicate some profit-taking. Ethereum's ETF inflows highlight growing institutional interest, but mixed signals from its founders have introduced caution. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on major exchanges, while Dogecoin's dramatic rally in November reflects speculative interest, albeit with low on-chain activity. Tether's recent minting activity indicates strong demand for stablecoins, but its involvement in money laundering cases raises concerns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price decreases, Bitcoin's strong monthly performance and institutional interest suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant ETF inflows indicate growing institutional interest, but caution is warranted due to mixed signals from its founders.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in DeFi activity and renewed trading on major platforms support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — While recent gains are impressive, low on-chain activity suggests caution; however, potential regulatory discussions could impact future sentiment.

USDT: 0.0 — While demand for stablecoins remains strong, potential regulatory issues and market optimism suggest maintaining current exposure."
2024-11-29 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a substantial rally, nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen record inflows into its ETFs, indicating growing investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, further boosting its price. Dogecoin has also surged significantly, buoyed by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by substantial minting activity, although it faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news and technical indicators supporting further gains. The proximity to the $100K milestone adds to its bullish appeal.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some caution from mixed founder signals, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and the resumption of U.S. trading on Bitstamp provide a solid foundation for continued growth, justifying a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has surged significantly, the lack of substantial on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm, suggesting a cautious but positive stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall market sentiment leaning bullish, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, prompting a slight decrease in USDT allocation to free up capital for other assets."

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward trends observed across several major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has seen a notable increase, nearing $98K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum, while experiencing record ETF inflows, has shown mixed signals with a slight pullback after reaching a five-month high. Solana's market activity is robust, with substantial DEX volume and renewed trading interest in the U.S. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, reflecting broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, though recent news highlights its involvement in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by significant institutional mining activity and bullish market sentiment, makes it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite record ETF inflows, Ethereum's technical indicators remain sideways, and recent mixed signals suggest a cautious approach, though it still holds potential for growth.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's positive developments, including increased DEX volume and renewed trading interest, indicate strong momentum and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's substantial rally and ongoing discussions with lawmakers suggest continued interest and potential for further appreciation.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether remains stable, the current bullish market sentiment reduces the need for stablecoin exposure, though recent news warrants caution."
2024-11-29 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and a substantial monthly gain. Ethereum has seen record inflows into its ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although some caution remains due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana has benefited from increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp, showing robust growth. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, fueled by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting new USDT to meet demand, despite some negative news regarding its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with bullish technical indicators and positive news on institutional mining, suggesting continued growth potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed signals, the record ETF inflows and recent price gains indicate a positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to founder-related news.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and positive news from Bitstamp support a bullish stance, with technical indicators also showing upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's significant rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive outlook, though the recent price surge suggests a need for cautious optimism.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether is actively minting to meet demand, the stablecoin's role in money laundering raises concerns, balancing the need for liquidity with potential risks."
2024-11-29 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, supported by strong institutional mining activity and a notable monthly gain. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although mixed signals from its founder have introduced some caution. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi volume has surpassed Ethereum's, highlighting its growing ecosystem. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to play a critical role in the market, with significant minting activity to meet demand, despite some negative news regarding its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, coupled with positive news and institutional interest, makes it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, mixed signals from its founder suggest a more cautious approach, though the overall trend remains positive.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive technical indicators and increased trading activity, especially in the DeFi space, support a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Despite some recent volatility, Dogecoin's massive rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the bullish market conditions, maintaining a neutral position on USDT is prudent, as it serves as a liquidity buffer without immediate need for reduction."
2024-11-29 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, bolstered by institutional mining and nearing a psychological price milestone, makes it a highly attractive asset in the current market environment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed signals from its founders, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, though with some caution warranted.

SOL: +0.6 — The resumption of U.S. trading and strong DeFi activity provide a robust bullish case for Solana, making it a favorable asset to increase exposure to.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has seen significant gains, the lack of substantial on-chain activity and the potential volatility from upcoming discussions suggest a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-29 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Meanwhile, Tether continues to play a crucial role in liquidity, despite concerns over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum and positive news about institutional mining support a bullish outlook. The asset is nearing a significant psychological level, which could attract further buying interest.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a favorable environment, although mixed founder signals warrant some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price gains are supported by increased DeFi activity and renewed trading access in the U.S., indicating strong demand and potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's significant rally and increased transaction activity suggest continued interest, but the potential for regulatory scrutiny introduces some uncertainty.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT remains crucial for liquidity, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests a neutral stance, as capital is likely to flow into riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing substantial inflows into its ETFs, indicating growing investor interest, although there are mixed signals from its founders. Solana has seen a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi activity has surpassed Ethereum's, highlighting its growing ecosystem. Dogecoin has also seen a massive rally, fueled by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Tether continues to see high demand, with significant minting activity, although it faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and nearing a significant psychological price level. Institutional mining activity supports further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong interest, despite mixed signals from founders.

SOL: +0.6 — Re-enabled trading in the U.S. and strong DeFi activity suggest continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive outlook, but caution is warranted due to volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite high demand and minting activity, the overall bullish market reduces the need for stablecoin exposure."
2024-11-29 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the DeFi space, with Bitstamp resuming trading in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, fueled by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with significant on-chain activity and positive news, suggesting continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite a slight pullback, Ethereum's ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong investor interest and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's increased trading activity and positive news from Bitstamp support a bullish outlook, although the recent price decrease warrants some caution.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent rally and upcoming discussions involving influential figures suggest potential for further price appreciation, though the current low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — While demand for USDT remains high, the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation."
2024-11-29 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen record inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and has surpassed Ethereum in DeFi activity. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, fueled by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Tether continues to see high demand, with significant minting activity, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and significant on-chain activity. The approach toward $100K and institutional interest make it highly attractive.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite a slight pullback, Ethereum's record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest continued investor interest, warranting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increased trading activity and dominance in DeFi volumes indicate strong market interest, especially with the resumption of U.S. trading.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of substantial new developments in the last few hours suggests a more cautious approach, though sentiment remains positive.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT, despite its recent minting activity."
2024-11-29 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and showing strong on-chain activity and institutional interest. Ethereum is experiencing significant inflows into ETFs, indicating growing investor confidence, although technical signals are mixed. Solana is gaining traction with increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest, while Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by speculative interest and potential regulatory discussions. Tether remains stable but has been involved in negative news related to money laundering, though it continues to see high demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with significant on-chain activity and positive news, suggesting further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical signals, the substantial ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in trading activity and DeFi engagement support a bullish stance on Solana.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the speculative nature and low on-chain activity warrant a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite its stability, the negative news and overall bullish market sentiment suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation."
2024-11-29 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with notable gains across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen a significant rise, nearing $100K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has also experienced substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana has benefited from increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on Bitstamp, boosting its price. Dogecoin has surged significantly, supported by broader market gains and potential discussions with lawmakers. However, Tether's involvement in money laundering highlights some underlying risks in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and institutional interest, with positive news and technical indicators supporting further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed founder signals, strong ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest continued investor interest and potential for growth.

SOL: +0.6 — Resumed trading on Bitstamp and increased DeFi activity provide a strong foundation for further price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant recent gains and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive outlook, but the volatility warrants cautious optimism.

USDT: 0.0 — While stablecoin demand remains, the broader market's bullish sentiment and Tether's involvement in money laundering suggest maintaining a neutral stance."
2024-11-29 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant price increases observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable rise, nearing $98K, supported by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating growing investor interest, although some caution remains due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana has benefited from increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp, leading to a surge in its price. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, with significant minting activity, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional interest, along with positive news, suggest continued bullish potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from founders, strong ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on major platforms support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop, though caution is warranted due to volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — While demand remains strong, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests a rotation into riskier assets, balancing the need for liquidity."
2024-11-29 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark and experiencing its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution.

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, significant price gains, and positive mining activity suggest continued bullishness. The nearing of the $100K mark further supports a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from founders, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate a positive outlook, warranting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp contribute to its bullish sentiment, justifying a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of substantial on-chain activity and the potential for regulatory discussions suggest a cautious approach, though the overall sentiment remains positive.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the bullish market conditions, there is no immediate need to hold stablecoins, but the lack of USDT in the portfolio means no reduction is possible."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The crypto market is experiencing a bullish sentiment, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark, marking its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum has seen significant inflows into its ETFs, indicating strong institutional interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from renewed trading activity in the U.S. and a surge in DeFi activity, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Tether continues to see high demand, with significant minting activity, although it faces scrutiny due to its alleged use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, significant price gains, and increased institutional mining activity suggest a continued bullish trend. The market sentiment is highly supportive of further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some caution, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate a positive outlook. The technicals are not as strong as Bitcoin, but the institutional interest is a positive driver.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's resurgence in U.S. trading and its impressive DeFi activity position it well for further gains. The recent price increases and trading volume support a bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop. However, the low on-chain activity tempers the enthusiasm slightly.

USDT: 0.0 — While there is ongoing demand for USDT, the broader market's bullish sentiment suggests a preference for riskier assets. However, given the lack of USDT holdings, no reduction is possible."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive sentiment, marking one of its best monthly performances since 2021. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although there are mixed signals from its founders. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi activity is surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin has surged significantly, buoyed by broader market gains and potential discussions with lawmakers. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although there are concerns about its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, nearing $100K, and positive institutional activity suggest continued bullishness. The macroeconomic environment supports risk-on sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from founders, the record ETF inflows indicate strong investor interest, warranting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Resumed trading in the U.S. and surpassing Ethereum in DeFi activity highlight Solana's growing appeal, justifying increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, the lack of significant new developments in the past few hours suggests a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and ongoing demand for USDT, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the broader market's risk-on environment."
2024-11-30 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, though its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is making strides in scalability with its Pectra upgrade, while Solana is experiencing a price correction amidst a generally bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to grow, with Tether maintaining a dominant position. Macroeconomic indicators show a stable environment with low volatility, suggesting a balanced risk appetite in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent rally and high transaction activity indicate strong market interest, though the drop in dominance suggests some capital rotation into altcoins.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and stable on-chain activity support a moderate buy signal, despite mixed momentum signals.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite a recent price dip, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive news outlook justify a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin shows bullish momentum, the recent price consolidation and high transaction activity suggest a hold position as the market digests recent gains.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is decreasing as altcoins gain traction, suggesting a potential altseason. Ethereum is focusing on scalability improvements, while Solana shows signs of consolidation despite a bullish long-term forecast. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with analysts predicting further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its market presence, reflecting strong demand in the DeFi space. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and no significant shifts in major indices or commodities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in price, Bitcoin's strong November rally and increased on-chain activity suggest continued interest. However, the drop in dominance indicates a shift towards altcoins, warranting a balanced approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's focus on scalability and recent price stability provide a positive outlook, though the lack of strong momentum signals suggests a moderate allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price consolidation and positive long-term forecasts, coupled with normal on-chain activity, support a higher allocation as it remains attractive in the current market.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains suggest a cautious increase in allocation, though the recent price decrease warrants some restraint.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as capital rotation into riskier assets is not yet fully supported by market conditions."
2024-11-30 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and proximity to the $100K mark suggest continued bullish sentiment, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — The Pectra upgrade and legal clarity around Tornado Cash provide a positive outlook for Ethereum, supporting a slightly higher allocation preference.

SOL: +0.4 — Although experiencing a recent dip, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive AI predictions suggest a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains justify a cautious buy signal, though less aggressive than other altcoins.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent to allow for capital rotation into more promising opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has decreased as investors shift towards altcoins. Ethereum is showing signs of scalability improvements with the Pectra upgrade, while Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase despite a bullish trend. Dogecoin remains in a bullish pattern after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to grow, led by USDT, which remains a key player in the DeFi space. Overall, the macroeconomic indicators suggest a stable environment, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, supporting a moderate risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, BTC's strong November rally and proximity to $100K indicate continued investor interest. However, the lack of a clear bullish momentum signal suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and bullish momentum signal provide a positive outlook, supported by recent price increases and technical upgrades.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a price correction, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future price predictions warrant a moderate allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains suggest a slight increase in allocation, but caution is advised due to recent volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With a growing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's dominance has slightly decreased, indicating a shift towards altcoins, suggesting a potential altseason. Ethereum shows bullish momentum with its scalability improvements and favorable court rulings, while Solana continues to exhibit a bullish trend despite minor pullbacks. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, remains robust, reflecting strong demand in DeFi and trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued bullish sentiment. However, caution is warranted due to the shift towards altcoins.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish momentum, driven by scalability improvements and favorable legal news, makes it highly attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's overall bullish trend and positive price forecasts support a favorable allocation, despite recent minor pullbacks.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains justify a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the current market optimism and shift towards riskier assets, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent to allow for capital rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-11-30 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its market dominance has decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum continues to show bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, suggesting potential for further gains. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains a bullish outlook, supported by positive AI predictions. Dogecoin, after a significant rally, is consolidating within a bullish pattern, indicating potential for further upside. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion reflects growing demand in the DeFi space, but its role as a stablecoin suggests limited upside in a bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued bullish sentiment, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and bullish momentum, along with favorable legal developments, support a strong buy signal as it shows potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a price correction, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions justify a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout support a moderate buy signal, reflecting optimism for further price increases.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in a bullish market, serving as a safe haven rather than a growth asset."
2024-11-30 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum shows bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, while Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase with a positive long-term outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to grow, led by USDT, which remains a key player in the DeFi space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a recent rally, Bitcoin's dominance is declining, and technical indicators do not show strong buy signals. However, the overall market sentiment remains positive, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum exhibits strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding scalability improvements. It is currently experiencing a breakout, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana is in a consolidation phase but maintains a bullish long-term trend. Recent price corrections provide a potential buying opportunity, albeit with caution.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin is consolidating within a bullish pattern, and analysts predict further upside. The potential for a breakout supports a moderate buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, there is no immediate need to allocate capital to USDT, especially as risk appetite increases."
2024-11-30 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong November rally, although its dominance has decreased as capital shifts towards altcoins. Ethereum continues to show bullish momentum, supported by technical upgrades and favorable legal news. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains a bullish outlook with predictions of further price increases. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical trends. Meanwhile, USDT remains a dominant force in the stablecoin market, although the current environment suggests a potential shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's recent rally and strong price levels suggest continued interest. However, the lack of buy signals from technical indicators tempers the score.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum with consistent buy signals and favorable news regarding scalability improvements, making it an attractive asset.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consolidation phase and positive long-term predictions support a moderate buy signal, although current technical indicators are mixed.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for significant gains justify a positive score, despite low on-chain activity.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, USDT's relative attractiveness decreases, warranting a slight reduction in exposure."
2024-11-30 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, though its dominance has decreased as investors shift towards altcoins, indicating a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum shows bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal rulings, while Solana's price correction suggests consolidation within a broader upward trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical patterns. Tether's expansion in the stablecoin market highlights growing demand, though its role as a safe haven may diminish if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and recent price levels indicate continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and favorable news regarding scalability and legal rulings support a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall trend remains bullish, supported by positive forecasts and technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains based on historical trends suggest a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-30 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum is benefiting from technical upgrades and legal clarity, maintaining bullish momentum. Solana, despite a recent price dip, remains in a bullish trend with positive future forecasts. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion reflects strong demand in the DeFi space, but its stable nature makes it less attractive in a bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a recent rally, Bitcoin's dominance is declining, indicating a shift towards altcoins. However, strong on-chain activity supports a modest positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and bullish momentum suggest a strong position, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's bullish trend and positive future predictions, despite short-term volatility, make it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While consolidating, Dogecoin's potential for a breakout and historical uptrend support a slightly positive stance.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in a bullish market, serving as a safe haven rather than a growth opportunity."
2024-11-30 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum shows bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, while Solana and Dogecoin are consolidating but remain in a bullish pattern. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains high, which could temper risk-on sentiment. Tether's expansion indicates strong demand for stablecoins, reflecting a mixed risk appetite in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a recent rally, BTC's dominance is declining, and technical indicators are neutral. However, strong on-chain activity and proximity to $100K support a modest positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and recent technical upgrades, combined with favorable legal news, make it an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.4 — While experiencing a price correction, SOL's overall bullish trend and positive news forecast continued upward momentum, justifying a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent rally and potential for a breakout, DOGE's low on-chain activity and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.2 — With increasing interest in altcoins and a relatively stable macro environment, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance is decreasing as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing bullish signals with technical upgrades and legal clarity on Tornado Cash, while Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains an upward trajectory. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a risk-on sentiment that could favor cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, Bitcoin's strong November performance and the potential for continued gains make it attractive, especially as it approaches the psychological $100K level.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's bullish technical indicators and positive news regarding scalability improvements and legal clarity provide a strong case for increased allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's consolidation phase and positive future price predictions suggest a stable upward trend, making it a favorable asset, albeit with some caution due to recent price corrections.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for significant upside based on historical trends justify a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market and the shift towards riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-30 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance has decreased as altcoins gain traction, indicating a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum shows bullish momentum, supported by technical upgrades and favorable legal news. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains an overall bullish trend, with predictions of further price increases. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its market presence, reflecting strong demand for stablecoins in DeFi and trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and high transaction activity suggest continued interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is supported by technical upgrades and positive legal news, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — While experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive price forecasts indicate potential for future appreciation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout suggest moderate upside potential.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT as the market shows a preference for riskier assets."
2024-11-30 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is decreasing as investors shift towards altcoins, indicating a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing positive developments with scalability improvements, though recent legal challenges may introduce some uncertainty. Solana is experiencing a minor pullback but maintains a bullish outlook, supported by positive AI predictions. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet demand, highlighting the stablecoin's leading role in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's recent rally and strong on-chain activity suggest continued interest, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and scalability improvements support a bullish outlook, making Ethereum an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions justify a modest buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains suggest a slight increase in allocation, though with caution.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the market's bullish sentiment and potential capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable."
2024-11-30 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is decreasing as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum shows promising developments with scalability improvements, while Solana's price correction indicates consolidation within a bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a balanced approach to risk assets. However, the stablecoin market remains robust, indicating ongoing demand for liquidity and safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and on-chain activity suggest continued interest, warranting moderate allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and scalability enhancements make Ethereum attractive, especially given its strong market position and recent bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a price pullback, Solana's long-term bullish outlook and AI predictions support a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stablecoin market that remains strong, maintaining a neutral position aligns with a balanced risk strategy."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has slightly decreased as capital rotates into altcoins. Ethereum is showing positive technical developments with its scalability improvements, although legal challenges around Tornado Cash present some uncertainty. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains a bullish outlook, supported by AI predictions. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, reflecting ongoing demand in DeFi and trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued bullish sentiment. On-chain activity remains robust, supporting a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and bullish trend signals provide a strong case for increased allocation, despite mixed momentum signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consolidation phase and positive long-term predictions suggest a moderate buy signal, though current technical indicators are neutral.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a slight positive bias, although on-chain activity is low.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other cryptocurrencies, a reduced allocation to USDT is warranted."
2024-11-30 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing promising developments with scalability improvements, while Solana is consolidating after a brief dip, with forecasts suggesting continued upward momentum. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical trends. Tether continues to expand, reflecting strong demand in the DeFi space, although its role as a stablecoin suggests a more defensive position in the portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a decline in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued positive sentiment. However, the lack of a buy signal in technical indicators tempers the enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's scalability upgrades and legal clarity around Tornado Cash are positive, but mixed technical signals suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — While currently consolidating, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive forecasts indicate potential for growth, albeit with some caution due to recent price corrections.

DOGE: +0.1 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a modest positive outlook, though the lack of strong technical signals suggests restraint.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing exposure to USDT aligns with a strategy to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's market dominance is decreasing, indicating a shift towards altcoins, which might suggest an emerging ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing signs of scalability improvements with the Pectra upgrade, while Solana and Dogecoin are both experiencing consolidation phases with potential for upward movement. The stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether leading the charge, reflecting ongoing demand in DeFi and trading sectors. Overall, the market is showing signs of bullishness, but with some caution as investors diversify into altcoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent rally and bullish momentum, Bitcoin's decreasing dominance suggests a cautious approach. However, the overall market sentiment remains positive, supporting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and consistent buy signals indicate a favorable outlook. The potential for scalability improvements adds to its attractiveness.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consolidation below $240 and predictions of future gains suggest potential for growth, though the current technicals remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin is consolidating within a bullish pattern, and analyst predictions of a significant price increase support a slight positive bias.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the stablecoin market expanding, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent as capital rotates into riskier assets."
2024-11-30 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a strong rally, Bitcoin's dominance is decreasing, suggesting a shift towards altcoins. However, its proximity to the $100K mark and recent bullish momentum warrant a modest positive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and the court ruling on Tornado Cash are positive developments. The consistent buy signal from trend indicators supports a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana is in a consolidation phase with a bullish long-term forecast. Although technical signals are neutral, the overall sentiment remains positive.

2024-11-30 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's dominance is decreasing as investors shift interest towards altcoins, potentially signaling an ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing positive developments with scalability improvements, while Solana and Dogecoin are both experiencing consolidation after recent gains, with forecasts suggesting continued upward momentum. Tether remains a strong player in the stablecoin market, expanding its supply to meet growing demand in DeFi and trading.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish momentum, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest continued growth potential, although the drop in dominance warrants some caution.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and scalability improvements support Ethereum's attractiveness, despite mixed momentum indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite a recent price dip, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future forecasts justify a moderate allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout support a slight increase in allocation, though recent gains suggest caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's market dominance has decreased, indicating a shift towards altcoins, suggesting a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing signs of scalability improvements with its Pectra upgrade, while Solana's price correction reflects a consolidation phase amid a bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its market presence, leading the stablecoin sector. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, supporting a balanced risk-on approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight dip in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish momentum suggest continued upward potential. However, the shift towards altcoins warrants a balanced approach.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and strong technical signals provide a positive outlook. The recent court ruling also reduces regulatory uncertainty.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consolidation phase and AI-driven positive forecasts indicate potential for growth, though current technicals are neutral.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a modest positive allocation, though momentum signals are currently lacking.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of risk-on sentiment and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-11-30 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with technical upgrades, while Solana is experiencing a slight pullback but maintains a positive long-term outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, indicating potential for further gains. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether leading the charge, suggesting a robust demand for liquidity and stability in the crypto ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and bullish momentum indicators suggest continued growth potential. However, the lack of a clear buy signal tempers the score.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and bullish momentum, coupled with positive news about scalability improvements, make it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a minor pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts support a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation after a significant rally and potential for further gains based on historical trends justify a cautious positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the stablecoin market expanding, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent as risk appetite in the broader market increases."
2024-11-30 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment reflects a mixed environment with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong rally in November, though its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum's ecosystem is seeing technical upgrades, which could enhance its scalability, while Solana is experiencing a price correction amidst an overall bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by Tether, continues to expand, indicating sustained demand for liquidity and stability in the crypto space. Macroeconomic indicators such as a stable U.S. dollar and low volatility suggest a cautiously optimistic environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish technical signals suggest continued upward momentum, though the decrease in market dominance warrants a balanced approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and bullish momentum support a positive outlook, but the impact of recent legal news tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite a recent price dip, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts justify a modestly positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains suggest a slight increase in allocation, though caution is advised due to recent volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent given the stablecoin's role as a liquidity provider in a mixed market environment."
2024-12-01 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin experiencing increased institutional interest, which introduces both potential upside and new risks. Ethereum and Solana lack significant news, but technical indicators suggest a generally bullish sentiment for Ethereum, while Solana remains neutral. Dogecoin has shown a recent price increase but lacks strong momentum signals. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish environment. Tether's stablecoin status remains critical for liquidity, although its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating shifts in market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and a consistent buy signal from technical indicators suggest moderate bullishness, though potential risks from increased institutional involvement warrant caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the lack of significant news, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive, supporting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana does not present a strong case for allocation changes at this time.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite a recent price increase, the lack of bullish momentum and significant news suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall cautious but not bearish market sentiment, some capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets is warranted."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with slight bearish tendencies in Bitcoin and Solana, while Ethereum shows some bullish momentum. Bitcoin's price has been decreasing slightly, and the recent news about institutional adoption introduces new risks, which might contribute to increased volatility. Ethereum maintains a buy signal with bullish momentum, suggesting potential for upward movement. Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant bullish signals, with Solana remaining below its long-term moving average. USDT remains stable, but the news of XRP surpassing it in market capitalization could impact its perceived stability. The macroeconomic context, with relatively low volatility and stable oil and gold prices, suggests a cautious approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, the recent price decline and lack of bullish momentum suggest caution. The potential risks from increased institutional involvement also warrant a conservative stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum indicate a favorable outlook, making it relatively attractive in the current market environment.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of buy signals and no significant news suggest a neutral position, with no compelling reason to increase or decrease exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, the lack of bullish momentum and significant news keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market signals and potential volatility in other assets, maintaining some exposure to USDT as a stable asset is prudent, despite the news about XRP's market cap."
2024-12-01 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility in traditional markets as indicated by the VIX. However, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing some fluctuations, particularly with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential breakdown despite institutional interest. Ethereum maintains a positive trend signal but lacks significant news to drive momentum. Solana and Dogecoin are both experiencing slight declines, with no strong buy signals. Tether remains stable, but its position as a safe haven is challenged by XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, which may affect its attractiveness.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential breakdown with declining prices and low on-chain activity. Caution is advised.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum maintains a positive trend signal, and while there's no significant news, its technicals suggest a moderate buy opportunity.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana is experiencing a slight decline with no strong buy signals or news, suggesting a hold position is appropriate.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin has seen a recent price decrease with low on-chain activity, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed signals in the market and the potential for further volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT as a stable asset is prudent."
2024-12-01 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility (VIX at 13.4) and a strong U.S. dollar (DXY at 106.21). The cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing increased institutional interest but also facing potential risks due to its rapid price appreciation. Ethereum and Solana have no significant news, while Dogecoin has seen some price volatility. Tether remains stable, although its market cap has been surpassed by XRP. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with some assets showing potential for growth, while others remain stable or slightly bearish.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of a clear buy signal from technical indicators, the increased institutional interest suggests potential for future growth. However, the risks associated with rapid appreciation warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators and a recent price increase suggest a moderate positive outlook, although the absence of significant news keeps the score conservative.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical indicators do not provide a clear buy signal, and the absence of significant news or volume changes suggests a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price volatility and lack of significant news or technical signals suggest a slight reduction in exposure, especially given current holdings.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the mixed signals across other assets and the stable macroeconomic environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2024-12-01 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility (VIX at 13.4) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a favorable risk appetite. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains elevated at 106.21, which can exert pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent price movements indicate a lack of strong bullish momentum, despite increased institutional interest, which introduces both opportunities and risks. Ethereum shows some positive technical signals, while Solana and Dogecoin lack clear directional trends. Tether's stablecoin status remains strong, but recent news of XRP surpassing it in market capitalization could influence investor sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, Bitcoin's technical indicators are weak, with no clear buy signals and a potential breakdown risk. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum maintains a buy signal on its trend, and its price stability amidst market fluctuations suggests a relatively stronger position. Incremental increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana lacks clear technical signals and significant news, suggesting a neutral stance. No changes in allocation are recommended.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's price volatility and lack of positive momentum signals suggest a cautious reduction in exposure, given current holdings.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of uncertain trends in other assets and the stable macro environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed backdrop for cryptocurrencies. The relatively low volatility in the S&P 500 and a stable U.S. Dollar Index suggest a calm broader market, but the high 10-Year Treasury Yield indicates potential pressure on risk assets. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility and new risks. Ethereum and Solana show no significant news, while Dogecoin remains quiet. Tether's market cap has been surpassed by XRP, highlighting shifts in the stablecoin market. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious with slight bearish undertones, as reflected in the technical indicators and recent price movements.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, Bitcoin's technical indicators are weak, with no buy signals and a recent price breakdown. The potential risks from increased institutional involvement warrant caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Ethereum maintains a buy signal on the trend, but lacks momentum. The absence of significant news suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook, given its stable technical position.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's technical indicators show no clear buy signals, and without significant news, it remains in a holding pattern. The lack of momentum suggests a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin shows a slight positive trend signal but lacks momentum and significant news. Given its recent price decrease, a slightly reduced exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the cautious market sentiment and recent price volatility in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against potential downside risks."
2024-12-01 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility (VIX at 13.4) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains high at 106.21, which could exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent institutional interest introduces both opportunities and risks, as rapid price appreciation could lead to volatility. Ethereum shows consistent buy signals from technical indicators, though no significant news has emerged. Solana and Dogecoin lack strong technical or news-driven catalysts. Tether remains stable, but its position as a safe haven is challenged by XRP's recent market cap surpassing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, the lack of technical buy signals and potential volatility from rapid price appreciation suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from technical indicators and a stable macro environment make ETH relatively attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant technical or news-driven catalysts, SOL remains neutral. Current holdings should be maintained.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, the lack of strong technical signals and news keeps DOGE in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the potential for volatility in other assets and the stable macro backdrop, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT is prudent for liquidity and risk management."
2024-12-01 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong at 106.21, which could exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which introduces both opportunities and risks. Ethereum and Solana show no significant news, while Dogecoin's technical indicators suggest a neutral stance. Tether's position as a stablecoin remains strong, though it has been surpassed by XRP in market capitalization, indicating potential shifts in capital allocation within the crypto space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest is a positive long-term signal, but current technical indicators are neutral. The macro environment is stable, supporting a modest positive allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, Ethereum's consistent buy signal from trend indicators suggests a slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to suggest a change in allocation. Maintain current exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a slight increase in price, there are no strong technical or news-driven signals to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the stable macro environment and the absence of strong buy signals for other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT as a defensive position is prudent."
2024-12-01 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 performance. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains high, suggesting a strong dollar environment which could weigh on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which introduces both opportunities and risks due to potential regulatory scrutiny. Ethereum shows consistent buy signals from trend indicators, although momentum remains weak. Solana and Dogecoin are showing slight price increases but lack strong momentum signals. Tether's market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest is a positive long-term signal, but current technicals are mixed with low on-chain activity. The strong dollar environment may limit upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators and a stable price increase suggest moderate confidence in further gains, despite the lack of significant news.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent price increase and normal on-chain activity indicate some positive sentiment, but lack of strong momentum signals limits confidence.

DOGE: +0.1 — Slight price increase and bullish momentum signal suggest a cautious positive outlook, though low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing some bullish tendencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with low volatility (VIX at 13.4) and a strong S&P 500 index, indicating a generally positive risk sentiment. Bitcoin shows signs of institutional interest, which could introduce both opportunities and risks. Ethereum and Solana lack significant news, but both show some technical strength. Dogecoin has bullish momentum, though its on-chain activity remains low. Tether's market cap has been surpassed by XRP, which might suggest a shift in stablecoin preference or liquidity dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of a strong buy signal from technical indicators, the institutional interest and bullish momentum suggest a positive outlook. However, the potential risks from increased institutional involvement warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators and normal on-chain activity support a modestly positive stance, though the absence of significant news keeps enthusiasm in check.

SOL: +0.2 — While lacking strong technical signals, the recent price increase and stable on-chain activity suggest a cautiously optimistic view.

DOGE: +0.1 — Bullish momentum is present, but low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm, leading to a slightly positive allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive market sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent, though the lack of USDT holdings limits the impact of this score."
2024-12-01 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX at 13.4, and the S&P 500 showing strength. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility despite its recent price appreciation. Ethereum and Solana show mixed technical signals, with Ethereum maintaining a buy trend but lacking momentum, while Solana's price has been volatile without clear buy signals. Dogecoin has shown some positive momentum but faced a recent price decrease. Tether remains stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite institutional interest introducing potential risks, Bitcoin's technical indicators show bullish momentum, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.1 — Ethereum maintains a buy trend, but the lack of momentum and significant news keeps the signal cautious.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's technical indicators are mixed, with no strong buy signals, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price decrease and lack of bullish momentum suggest a slight reduction in exposure, given current holdings.

USDT: +0.2 — With some uncertainty in the market and no current holdings, a slight preference for increasing stablecoin exposure is prudent to manage risk."
2024-12-01 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals present for most assets, particularly BTC and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce new volatility risks despite its current upward momentum. Ethereum shows consistent buy signals, though lacking significant news catalysts. Solana's technical indicators are mixed, with no major news developments. Dogecoin maintains bullish momentum, but its low on-chain activity suggests caution. USDT remains stable, but its relative attractiveness may decrease as investors seek higher returns in a bullish environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Strong momentum and institutional interest support a positive outlook, but potential risks from increased institutional involvement warrant a moderate score.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and stable market conditions, though lacking significant news catalysts to drive strong upward movement.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed technical indicators with no significant news, but slight positive price movement suggests cautious optimism.

DOGE: +0.1 — Bullish momentum persists, but low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm, leading to a modest positive score.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment leans bullish, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-12-01 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by technical indicators and increased on-chain activity. However, the news of increased institutional involvement introduces potential risks. Ethereum is experiencing sideways movement with no significant news or technical momentum, suggesting a neutral stance. Solana's technical indicators are mixed, with bullish momentum but lacking a buy signal from trend indicators. Dogecoin shows low activity and lacks bullish momentum despite a buy signal from trend indicators. Tether remains stable, but the news of XRP surpassing it in market cap could influence perceptions of its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity suggest a bullish outlook, though institutional involvement introduces some risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and sideways technical indicators suggest a hold position.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the lack of a trend buy signal, bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity provide a slightly positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Low activity and lack of bullish momentum suggest a neutral stance despite a buy signal from trend indicators.

USDT: -0.2 — While maintaining stability, the market's cautious bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 performance. The crypto market shows mixed signals, with Bitcoin experiencing strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum, despite concerns about institutional adoption risks. Ethereum's technical indicators are neutral, lacking significant news to drive sentiment. Solana shows bullish momentum but lacks a buy signal from trend indicators. Dogecoin has seen a recent increase in on-chain activity but lacks strong momentum signals. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum suggest continued interest, though institutional risks warrant caution.

ETH: 0.0 — Neutral technical indicators and lack of significant news suggest holding current positions without increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a moderate positive outlook, though trend signals remain neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite increased on-chain activity, lack of momentum and significant news keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With the broader market showing some bullish signals, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of risk assets seems appropriate."
2024-12-01 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish inclination. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility but also signifies growing acceptance. Ethereum and Solana show stable activity without significant news, while Dogecoin remains relatively quiet. Tether's position is slightly weakened by XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, indicating a potential shift in stablecoin dynamics. Overall, the macroeconomic context remains stable with low volatility, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and strong on-chain activity suggest potential for further gains, though new risks are present.

ETH: +0.2 — Stable technical indicators and no significant news, maintaining a slightly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Consistent bullish momentum signals and stable on-chain activity support a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or strong technical signals leads to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive market sentiment, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-12-01 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by increased institutional interest, despite the associated risks.

Dogecoin's technical indicators suggest a lack of clear direction, while Tether remains stable but has been surpassed by XRP in market capitalization, indicating a potential shift in investor preference. The macroeconomic environment, with moderate volatility and stable commodity prices, supports a balanced approach to risk, favoring growth assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with institutional interest, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin investment.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are mixed, Ethereum's stable performance and potential for growth in a bullish market warrant a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite a lack of buy signals, Solana's consistent bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity suggest a slight preference for increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and no significant news lead to a neutral stance on Dogecoin, suggesting a hold strategy.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies and XRP surpassing Tether in market cap, there is a reduced need for stablecoin exposure, prompting a shift towards more volatile assets."
2024-12-01 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum maintaining upward momentum in both price and on-chain activity. Bitcoin's recent institutional interest, despite introducing new risks, indicates a growing acceptance and potential for further price appreciation. Ethereum, while lacking significant news, shows strong technical indicators. Solana's technicals have improved, showing bullish momentum, while Dogecoin has experienced a significant price increase, indicating a potential breakout. Tether remains stable, but the recent overtaking by XRP in market capitalization suggests a shift in investor interest towards other assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and increased institutional interest suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, despite the lack of significant news, indicate a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and improved technical indicators suggest potential for price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price increase and breakout potential, but cautious due to lack of supporting news.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, holding USDT is less attractive in the current market environment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and buy signals from trend indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce new risks but also suggests a growing acceptance and potential for price appreciation. Ethereum and Solana show consistent buy signals, although without significant news, their movements are driven primarily by technical indicators. Dogecoin has shown a recent price increase and bullish momentum, but lacks significant news to drive further sentiment. Tether remains stable, but the recent overtaking by XRP in market capitalization might influence its perceived stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with institutional interest, suggest potential for further price appreciation despite associated risks.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, although lacking significant news, indicate a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish momentum and buy signals from trend indicators suggest a positive outlook, despite the absence of significant news.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price increase and bullish momentum provide a slight positive signal, though lacking strong news support.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals across other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-12-01 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum both exhibiting strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity. Bitcoin's price is supported by institutional interest, although this brings potential risks. Ethereum lacks significant news but maintains a positive technical outlook. Solana and Dogecoin also show bullish momentum, with Solana having consistent buy signals and Dogecoin experiencing a recent price surge. Tether remains stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating a shift in capital allocation within the crypto space. Overall, the market appears to be in a risk-on phase, with a preference for growth-oriented assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, despite the absence of significant news, support a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Persistent buy signals and bullish momentum, along with stable on-chain activity, make Solana an attractive option.

DOGE: +0.3 — Recent price surge and bullish momentum provide a moderate buy signal, although the lack of significant news tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — With the market in a risk-on phase, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as capital rotates into more volatile assets."
2024-12-01 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility in the S&P 500 and a moderate U.S. Dollar Index. Cryptocurrency markets are showing bullish momentum across major assets, with technical indicators suggesting buy signals for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's institutional adoption is increasing, which could introduce new risks but also signifies growing acceptance.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential risks from increased institutional involvement, Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and bullish momentum support a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, though the lack of significant news and slight recent price declines warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's consistent bullish momentum and technical signals, along with stable on-chain activity, make it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin shows bullish technical signals, the recent price fluctuations and lack of significant news suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies and capital rotating into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic indicators suggest a stable environment with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4, and a strong S&P 500 index at 6042.23. The cryptocurrency market is showing bullish momentum across most assets, with BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE all exhibiting positive technical signals, such as short-term moving averages being above long-term ones and MACD indicators showing bullish momentum. However, institutional interest in BTC is introducing new risks, as highlighted by recent news. USDT remains stable, but its relative attractiveness has decreased with XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, indicating a shift in market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite strong technical signals and on-chain activity, the news of increased institutional involvement introduces potential risks. Maintain a moderate positive stance.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are positive, the lack of significant news and recent price decreases suggest a cautious approach. Maintain a slight positive allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent bullish technical indicators and stable on-chain activity support a positive outlook. No significant news, but maintain a moderate positive stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Technical indicators are positive, and recent price increases suggest some upward momentum. However, without significant news, maintain a cautious positive allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With a bullish sentiment in the broader market and capital rotation into riskier assets, reduce exposure to stablecoins."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin all exhibiting positive technical indicators, such as bullish momentum and buy signals from short-term moving averages. Bitcoin's recent price increase and on-chain activity surge suggest strong interest, although institutional adoption introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana maintain positive trends, though without significant news catalysts. Dogecoin has experienced a notable price breakout, indicating heightened interest. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, but the news of XRP surpassing Tether in market capitalization may influence perceptions of stablecoin utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and increased institutional interest, despite potential risks, suggest continued bullishness. High transaction activity supports this view.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and stable on-chain activity, though lacking significant news, maintain a moderate bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite lacking a buy signal, Solana's consistent volume and bullish momentum suggest moderate potential for gains.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price increase and bullish momentum indicate strong interest and potential for further gains, despite no major news.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral, with no immediate need for increased allocation given the bullish sentiment in other assets."
2024-12-01 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with a low VIX indicating reduced market volatility, and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum with increased institutional interest, although this introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana show positive technical signals but lack significant news catalysts. Dogecoin has shown strong price momentum recently, but its volatility remains high. Tether is stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and increased institutional interest suggest continued upward momentum, despite potential risks from rapid price appreciation.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical signals are positive, the lack of significant news and mixed momentum suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive technical signals and stable on-chain activity support a moderate buy, but the absence of news limits stronger confidence.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price momentum is positive, but high volatility and lack of news warrant a cautious stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With a risk-on environment and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is prudent."
2024-12-01 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by both technical indicators and increased on-chain activity. However, the news of increased institutional involvement introduces potential risks, which could lead to volatility. Ethereum, while maintaining a buy signal from trend indicators, lacks significant news or momentum, suggesting a more neutral stance. Solana shows bullish momentum but lacks a buy signal from trend indicators, indicating mixed sentiment. Dogecoin has experienced a recent price increase and maintains bullish momentum, but without significant news, the outlook remains neutral. Tether remains stable, but the news of XRP surpassing it in market capitalization could indicate a shift in investor preference away from stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and on-chain activity support a bullish stance, but institutional risk news tempers enthusiasm slightly.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite buy signals from trend indicators, the lack of momentum and significant news suggests a neutral position.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish momentum is present, but the absence of a trend buy signal and significant news tempers the score.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price increase and bullish momentum are positive, but lack of significant news keeps the score modest.

USDT: -0.4 — With risk appetite increasing, capital is likely rotating out of stablecoins, especially given the news of XRP surpassing Tether in market cap."

Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum, while experiencing strong fund inflows, faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price drops. Solana is stabilizing after a supply chain attack, with analysts predicting a consolidation phase. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend with potential for a significant rally, driven by bullish sentiment and speculative interest. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT are less attractive as investors seek higher returns from more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum, supported by positive news such as institutional buying and ETF developments, making it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor interest, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana is stabilizing, the recent security issues and lack of strong bullish signals suggest a neutral stance for now.

DOGE: +0.5 — The potential for a 'Santa Rally' and current bullish momentum justify a positive allocation, though the volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-12-02 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing strong bullish momentum, supported by significant institutional interest and positive news regarding ETF options. Ethereum, despite recent inflows, faces mixed sentiment due to recent price drops. Solana is stabilizing after a security scare, while Dogecoin is experiencing volatile bullish momentum with potential for a significant rally. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional accumulation and ETF-related news create a favorable environment for continued upward momentum, supported by bullish technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows suggest underlying investor confidence, though technicals remain mixed.

SOL: +0.2 — While technical signals are not strongly bullish, the price is stabilizing within a forecasted range, and the ecosystem is recovering from recent security issues.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a 'Santa Rally' make DOGE attractive, though volatility remains high.

USDT: -0.5 — With a risk-on sentiment prevailing, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-12-02 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin and Dogecoin showing strong upward momentum and positive news catalysts. Bitcoin is benefiting from continued institutional interest and new financial products, while Dogecoin is experiencing a potential ""Santa Rally"" with significant price gains. Ethereum, despite leading in fund inflows, faces mixed sentiment due to recent price declines. Solana is under pressure from a security issue but is expected to stabilize within a broad price range. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a risk-on sentiment, reducing the attractiveness of stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and new ETF options are driving bullish momentum. On-chain activity supports further price increases.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, significant fund inflows indicate strong investor interest, suggesting potential for recovery.

SOL: -0.1 — Security concerns and recent price declines create uncertainty, but expected stabilization provides some support.

DOGE: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and positive news about a potential rally make it an attractive short-term investment.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, holding USDT is less favorable."
2024-12-02 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with notable developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price is showing bullish momentum supported by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, which could drive further institutional interest. Ethereum, despite recent inflows into ETH funds, is experiencing short-term bearish sentiment due to a recent price drop. Solana faces technical challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization within a broad range. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend with potential for a significant rally, while Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news from institutional adoption and ETF options support a bullish outlook. The current on-chain activity, although low, does not detract from the overall positive sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, the strong inflows into ETH funds indicate underlying investor interest. The technical indicators are mixed, suggesting a cautious but positive stance.

SOL: -0.2 — The recent supply chain attack introduces risk, and technical indicators show no clear buy signal. However, the expected price stabilization provides some support, warranting a slightly negative score.

DOGE: +0.5 — The potential for a 'Santa Rally' and current bullish momentum support a positive outlook. Despite some volatility, the overall sentiment is optimistic.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing continued institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide a supportive backdrop. However, Bitcoin's recent price action shows a lack of bullish momentum. Ethereum is seeing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, but recent price declines suggest caution. Solana is facing technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, which could hinder its recovery despite analysts' forecasts of price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential rally, driven by bullish sentiment and attempts to break resistance levels. Tether remains stable with no significant developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ETF developments provide a supportive backdrop, but recent price action lacks strong momentum. Maintain a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong fund inflows, recent price declines and momentum loss suggest a cautious stance. Hold current position without increasing exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Technical challenges from the supply chain attack and lack of bullish signals warrant reducing exposure. Focus on risk management.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment and potential for a rally justify a slight increase in exposure, but volatility remains a concern.

USDT: +0.1 — Maintain some exposure to stablecoins for risk management, given the mixed market sentiment and potential for further volatility."
2024-12-02 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 13.34. The crypto market has experienced some recent downward pressure, particularly in BTC and ETH, with both assets showing price decreases and low on-chain activity. However, BTC has received positive news with MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide a bullish underpinning. ETH has seen significant fund inflows, suggesting strong investor interest despite recent price drops. SOL is facing technical challenges with a compromised library, but analysts expect price stabilization. DOGE is experiencing volatile price movements with potential bullish momentum as analysts anticipate a ""Santa Rally."" USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines and low on-chain activity, positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF developments provide a bullish outlook, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence, though recent price declines and momentum loss warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical issues and lack of clear bullish signals suggest a neutral stance, awaiting further stabilization or positive developments.

DOGE: +0.4 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and bullish momentum indicators support a modestly positive outlook, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.2 — With some positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings may be prudent to capitalize on potential upward movements in riskier assets."
2024-12-02 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with low volatility (VIX at 13.34) and a strong S&P 500 index, indicating a generally risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin's market data presents mixed signals, with a recent price decline and low on-chain activity, but positive news from MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and new ETF options. Ethereum shows strong investor interest with significant fund inflows, despite recent price declines. Solana faces technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin's recent price drop contrasts with bullish news suggesting potential for a ""Santa Rally."" Tether remains stable without significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines and low on-chain activity, positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF options support a moderately bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, though recent price declines suggest caution. Overall, ETH remains attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges from a supply chain attack and mixed price signals suggest a neutral stance until further clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.2 — While recent price declines are concerning, bullish news about a potential ""Santa Rally"" provides some optimism for upward movement.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the generally risk-on sentiment and potential for bullish movements in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable."
2024-12-02 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin's recent price decline is countered by positive news such as MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could support future price stability. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, but faces short-term bearish momentum. Solana is dealing with security concerns due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is highly volatile, with potential for a ""Santa Rally"" but also significant recent price drops. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven during market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, positive news such as MicroStrategy's purchase and ETF options launch provide a supportive backdrop for potential recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, although recent price momentum is weak. The overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

SOL: 0.0 — Security concerns from the supply chain attack create uncertainty, but expected price stabilization suggests a hold position for now.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent significant price drop and volatility suggest caution. While a potential rally is possible, the current environment is unstable.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the overall market uncertainty and recent declines in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals with recent declines in major assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL, though DOGE shows potential for a rally. Bitcoin's recent ETF-related developments and MicroStrategy's continued accumulation are positive, but technical indicators remain bearish. Ethereum's significant fund inflows contrast with its recent price drop, indicating potential for recovery. Solana faces technical challenges but is expected to stabilize, while Dogecoin is poised for a potential rally. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bearish technicals, positive news from ETF options and institutional buying provides a supportive backdrop for potential recovery.

ETH: +0.1 — Strong fund inflows suggest underlying investor interest, though recent price declines warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical issues and a lack of strong bullish signals suggest a neutral stance, awaiting further stabilization.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment and potential for a 'Santa Rally' make DOGE relatively attractive in the current environment.

USDT: -0.2 — Slight reduction in stablecoin holdings as risk appetite increases, though maintaining some exposure for stability."
2024-12-02 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a series of price declines despite positive news about MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum is seeing strong investor interest with significant fund inflows, yet it faces short-term bearish momentum. Solana is stabilizing after a supply chain attack on its library, with analysts expecting a consolidation phase. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with potential for a bullish rally, although recent price action has been negative. The macroeconomic context, with relatively low volatility and stable gold and oil prices, suggests a neutral to slightly risk-averse environment, which could favor holding stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF developments provide a supportive backdrop. However, technical indicators remain bearish, suggesting caution.

ETH: +0.1 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor interest, but short-term bearish momentum and recent price drops warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — While price is stabilizing, recent security concerns and lack of strong bullish signals suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Volatility and potential for a 'Santa Rally' provide some upside potential, but recent price declines and technical weakness suggest moderation.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the overall cautious market sentiment and recent declines in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2024-12-02 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing positive news with MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, which could support its price. Ethereum is seeing strong investor interest with significant fund inflows, although recent price declines indicate short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts predict price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of potential bullish momentum with expectations of a 'Santa Rally'. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets, though caution is warranted due to recent technical indicators showing bearish signals across most assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF options introduction supports a moderate buy signal, despite technical indicators showing no bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, but recent price declines suggest caution. A moderate buy signal is appropriate given the mixed sentiment.

SOL: -0.1 — The supply chain attack poses risks, and technical indicators are not supportive. However, analyst forecasts of price stabilization warrant only a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and recent volatile uptrend suggest a cautious buy signal, though technical indicators remain bearish.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish signals in other assets and no significant news, reducing stablecoin exposure is reasonable as risk appetite increases slightly."
2024-12-02 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some bullish developments in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin continues to see strong institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could drive further demand. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor confidence, despite recent price declines. Solana faces technical challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts predict price stabilization. Dogecoin is gaining attention with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" suggesting bullish sentiment. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, which could support risk-on behavior in crypto.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional interest and ETF developments are strong bullish signals, suggesting potential for upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges and a lack of clear bullish signals suggest a neutral stance until more clarity on the security issues.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment around a potential ""Santa Rally"" and increased on-chain activity support a moderately bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-12-02 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some bullish developments, particularly for Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin's continued accumulation by institutional players like MicroStrategy and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options suggest growing institutional interest and potential upward momentum. Ethereum, despite leading fund inflows, faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price drops. Solana is experiencing some technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential rally, driven by speculative interest and bullish momentum. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a moderate risk-on environment, though caution remains due to mixed technical signals across assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Institutional interest and ETF-related news provide a strong bullish backdrop, despite mixed technical signals. Continued accumulation by MicroStrategy is a positive indicator.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows suggest investor confidence, although recent price drops warrant caution. Overall, the long-term outlook remains positive.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges from the supply chain attack create uncertainty, offsetting any potential bullish sentiment from price stabilization forecasts.

DOGE: +0.5 — Speculative interest and potential for a 'Santa Rally' support a bullish outlook, despite recent volatility. The asset is showing signs of upward momentum.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, holding USDT is less attractive in the current environment."
2024-12-02 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments across several assets. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest, highlighted by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could drive further demand. Ethereum shows mixed signals; while it leads in fund inflows, it faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price declines. Solana is stabilizing after a supply chain attack, with analysts expecting consolidation within a defined range. Dogecoin is witnessing a volatile uptrend, with potential for a ""Santa Rally"" that could push prices higher. In contrast, Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting a neutral stance in the current market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Strong institutional accumulation and the introduction of ETF options suggest a bullish outlook. The recent bullish momentum signal further supports increasing exposure.

**ETH: +0.3** — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence. The potential for recovery justifies a moderate positive allocation.

**SOL: +0.2** — Price stabilization and expected consolidation within a defined range suggest a cautious but positive outlook, despite recent security concerns.

**DOGE: +0.5** — The potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent price increases indicate growing bullish sentiment, warranting increased exposure.

**USDT: 0.0** — With no significant news and a stable market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate as other assets show more potential for growth."
2024-12-02 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish with some mixed signals. Bitcoin continues to see strong institutional interest, evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could drive further demand. Ethereum, despite recent inflows into funds, faces short-term bearish sentiment due to a recent price drop. Solana is experiencing some technical challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization.

DOGE: +0.5 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and recent price volatility indicate a speculative opportunity, though with caution due to inherent volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is prudent."

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment reflects mixed sentiment across the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin continues to see institutional interest with MicroStrategy's ongoing purchases and new ETF options, suggesting a supportive backdrop despite recent price volatility. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, but recent price declines highlight short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces technical risks due to a supply chain attack, though analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is volatile, with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" but faces resistance challenges. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish environment, favoring selective risk-taking over stablecoin holdings.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and ETF developments provide a supportive backdrop, despite recent price volatility. The overall sentiment remains cautiously bullish.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows suggest underlying investor confidence, though recent price declines warrant a moderate approach.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical risks from the supply chain attack and recent price fluctuations suggest a neutral stance until more stability is observed.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent price volatility indicate a cautiously optimistic outlook, though resistance levels remain a concern.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing interest in risk assets and a stable macro environment, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential upside in other assets."
2024-12-02 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic indicators suggest a relatively stable environment with a moderate level of volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market shows mixed signals with Bitcoin experiencing bullish momentum supported by significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum is seeing strong fund inflows, although recent price drops indicate short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend with potential for a 'Santa Rally'. There is no significant news for Tether, which remains stable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF-related developments are supportive, coupled with bullish momentum signals, making BTC an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — While price stabilization is expected, the recent supply chain attack introduces uncertainty, warranting a hold position until more clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from potential 'Santa Rally' and recent price increases suggest a moderate buy signal, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable."
2024-12-02 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish developments such as MicroStrategy's continued BTC accumulation and Ethereum leading crypto fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest. However, technical indicators show a lack of clear buy signals across most assets, and recent price movements have been volatile. Bitcoin's introduction of ETF options could provide a regulated exposure boost, while Ethereum's recent price drop reflects short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive news from MicroStrategy's accumulation and ETF options introduction supports a moderate buy signal, despite mixed technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows suggest investor confidence, but recent price drop and lack of bullish technical signals warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: 0.0 — The supply chain attack introduces risk, balancing out the potential for price stabilization. Maintain current exposure without increasing.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and volatile uptrend suggests a slight increase in allocation, but remain cautious due to high volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With some positive sentiment in risk assets, reduce exposure to stablecoins to capitalize on potential upward movements in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-12-02 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Solana is stabilizing after a supply chain attack, with expectations of consolidation within a defined price range. Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential rally, with analysts predicting a possible price surge. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with no significant changes in traditional financial indicators that would impact the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive sentiment from institutional buying and ETF options introduction supports a bullish outlook. Despite recent price volatility, the long-term trend remains favorable.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, but recent price decline suggests caution. Overall, the asset remains attractive for gradual accumulation.

SOL: 0.0 — Stabilization after security concerns and expected price consolidation suggest a neutral stance. No immediate catalysts for significant price movement.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a 'Santa Rally' provide a positive outlook. However, high volatility warrants a moderate approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2024-12-02 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment. Bitcoin continues to see institutional interest with MicroStrategy's ongoing accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide a supportive backdrop for BTC. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating robust investor interest despite recent price declines. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin shows signs of a potential rally, driven by bullish sentiment and speculative interest. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ETF developments are positive, but technical indicators are neutral. Maintain moderate exposure to capitalize on potential upside.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows suggest investor confidence, but recent price declines warrant caution. Slightly increase exposure to capture potential recovery.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite potential price stabilization, the recent security concerns pose risks. Hold current position until more clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish sentiment and potential for a 'Santa Rally' suggest a slight increase in exposure, but volatility remains high.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally positive sentiment across other assets, reduce reliance on stablecoins to allocate more capital towards growth opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context presents a mixed environment, with relatively stable interest rates, a strong U.S. dollar, and low volatility in the S&P 500. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing significant institutional interest, highlighted by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum is attracting strong fund inflows, although it recently faced a price drop due to momentum loss. Solana is dealing with security concerns following a supply chain attack, yet analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing potential for a bullish rally, driven by speculative interest. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a focus on strategic accumulation and potential bullish trends in certain assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional interest and ETF developments provide strong support. Despite mixed technicals, the news is highly positive, suggesting potential for upward movement.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, although recent price drop suggests caution. Overall, the sentiment leans positive with potential for recovery.

SOL: 0.0 — Security concerns from the supply chain attack balance out the potential for price stabilization. Neutral stance until further clarity on security issues.

DOGE: +0.5 — Speculative interest and potential for a 'Santa Rally' provide a bullish outlook. Despite volatility, the sentiment is positive with room for gains.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-12-02 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum is seeing strong fund inflows, suggesting investor confidence, despite recent price volatility. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack but is expected to stabilize within a defined price range. Dogecoin is riding on bullish sentiment with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" but remains volatile. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Strong institutional interest and ETF-related developments provide a bullish outlook. Positive momentum and on-chain activity support increased allocation.

**ETH: +0.5** — Despite recent price volatility, strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence. Bullish momentum is emerging, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

**DOGE: +0.2** — Bullish sentiment and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" support a slight increase in allocation, though volatility remains a concern.

**USDT: -0.5** — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential gains."
