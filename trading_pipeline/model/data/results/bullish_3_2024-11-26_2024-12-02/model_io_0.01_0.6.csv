2024-11-26 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin's recent drop after approaching the $100K mark has been attributed to profit-taking and a potential weakening in U.S. demand, as indicated by the Coinbase-Binance price gap. Ethereum, however, shows some bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, suggesting increased trader activity. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a major sell-off, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp decline, sees some traders viewing it as a buying opportunity. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices, suggests a cautious approach, potentially favoring stablecoins like USDT in the current environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent price drop and potential for further downside, as suggested by analysts, indicate a cautious approach. With no current holdings, a slight negative score reflects the decision to avoid exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price decreases, the record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on Ethereum suggest potential for upward movement, warranting a modest positive score.

SOL: -0.2 — The significant price drop and bearish sentiment from a major sell-off suggest caution. With no current holdings, a slight negative score reflects the decision to avoid exposure.

DOGE: +0.1 — While DOGE has experienced a sharp decline, the launch of the first DOGE ETP and some traders viewing the dip as a buying opportunity justify a cautious positive score.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the current bearish market sentiment and the absence of significant news, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent, as it provides stability amidst market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a mix of profit-taking and bearish signals, particularly for Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K and potential further downside suggests a cautious approach, while Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity. Solana faces bearish pressure from a significant sell-off and broader market corrections. Dogecoin, despite its recent drop, has some bullish sentiment due to new investment products. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong dollar, suggests a preference for risk management, potentially favoring stablecoins like USDT in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not favorable for new allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum. Current holdings support a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off create uncertainty. No current holdings, so no reduction needed, but not attractive for new allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price drop, the launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment balance the outlook. Current holdings suggest holding position.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of market uncertainty and potential downside risks, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2024-11-26 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with recent volatility and profit-taking seen across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, indicating potential further downside as analysts warn of weakening demand. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on its network. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a major sell-off and broader market corrections, while Dogecoin's recent ETP launch in the Nordics has not prevented a price drop, though some traders remain optimistic. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution, especially with no current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish sentiment from record derivatives open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent price drop and bearish pressure, no current holdings to adjust, and the market correction suggests a wait-and-see approach.

DOGE: +0.2 — While the price has dropped, the launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment provide a slight positive outlook.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market volatility and potential downside in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-11-26 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing the $100K mark, along with analysts predicting potential further downside, indicates a risk-off sentiment in BTC. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, suggesting increased trader activity and confidence. Solana is under pressure from a significant price drop and a major whale sell-off, which could indicate further bearishness. Dogecoin, despite a recent price drop, sees some bullish sentiment with the launch of a new ETP, suggesting potential buying interest. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential downside risk suggest caution. No current holdings allow for a neutral stance, but the bearish sentiment warrants a negative score if held.

ETH: +0.5 — Record open interest and strong on-chain activity indicate bullish sentiment, supporting increased allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off suggest bearish pressure. No current holdings, but if held, a reduction would be prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price drop, the launch of a new ETP provides some bullish sentiment, balancing the outlook.

USDT: +0.2 — In light of the cautious market sentiment, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2024-11-26 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline after approaching the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K, indicating weakening demand. Ethereum, however, shows some bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although it is also affected by the broader market correction. Solana and Dogecoin are both experiencing downward pressure, with Solana facing a significant sell-off and Dogecoin's recent price drop being seen as a potential buying opportunity by some traders. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during volatile market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite recent price increases, the significant drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. With no current holdings, a negative score is not applicable.

ETH: +0.3 — Rising open interest in derivatives indicates bullish sentiment, though the overall market correction tempers enthusiasm. Current holdings justify a moderate positive score.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent sell-off and lack of strong buy signals suggest a neutral stance, especially with no current holdings.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite some traders viewing the drop as a buying opportunity, the lack of strong technical signals and low on-chain activity warrant a cautious reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the bearish market sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bearish with a recent correction across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent attempt to breach the $100K mark was met with significant profit-taking, leading to a sharp decline and concerns about further downside. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with a record in derivatives open interest, though its price has been relatively stable. Solana experienced a notable drop due to a large sell-off, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in its ecosystem. Dogecoin, despite a recent price drop, maintains some bullish sentiment due to new financial products and continued interest. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option amidst volatility, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. Lack of current holdings supports a neutral to slightly negative stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate bullish sentiment, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent sell-off and weak ecosystem performance suggest caution. No current holdings justify a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the price drop, new financial products and continued interest provide a slight bullish tilt. Current holdings support maintaining exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the overall market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher stablecoin position is prudent for risk management."
2024-11-26 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently cautious, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential weakening in U.S. demand. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although its price remains under pressure. Solana has faced a notable decline due to a major sell-off and broader market correction, while Dogecoin's recent drop is seen by some as a buying opportunity, supported by the launch of a new ETP. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets, with volatility remaining relatively low.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the significant drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.3 — Rising open interest and bullish sentiment in derivatives markets indicate potential upside, though price remains under pressure.

SOL: -0.4 — Recent sell-off and weak ecosystem performance warrant caution. No current holdings to reduce.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent price drop and new ETP launch; no clear direction for immediate action.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the cautious market sentiment and potential for further downside in major assets, maintaining liquidity in USDT is prudent."
2024-11-26 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be bearish with significant price corrections across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum, despite setting a record in derivatives open interest, is also facing downward pressure. Solana and Dogecoin have both seen substantial price drops, with Solana affected by a major whale sell-off and Dogecoin experiencing a sharp decline despite the launch of a new ETP. In this environment, USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and bearish news suggest potential further downside. No current holdings to reduce, but caution is warranted.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the price decline, the record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate underlying bullish sentiment, warranting a modest positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Significant price drop and bearish news from whale activity suggest caution, but no current holdings to adjust.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite the recent ETP launch, the significant price drop and low transaction activity suggest reducing exposure to manage risk.

USDT: +0.4 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2024-11-26 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with notable declines across major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Bitcoin's recent drop from near $100K has triggered profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, with analysts suggesting potential further declines. Ethereum, despite a record open interest in derivatives, is experiencing a price decrease, indicating mixed sentiment.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite price decline, record open interest in derivatives indicates potential for recovery. Maintain current exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Significant price drop and bearish sentiment from whale sell-off. No current holdings to reduce.

DOGE: -0.2 — Significant price decline and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

USDT: +0.4 — In a bearish market, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant pullback after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening demand in the U.S. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, despite a slight price decline. Solana is under pressure due to a major sell-off and broader market correction, while Dogecoin's recent drop is met with mixed sentiment, as some traders see it as a buying opportunity. The macroeconomic context, with a strong U.S. Dollar Index and stable S&P 500, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets, with volatility remaining relatively low. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price decline and concerns over demand suggest caution; no current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite slight price weakness, strong derivatives activity indicates potential upside; maintain exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price drop and bearish sentiment from whale sell-off warrant caution; no current holdings to reduce.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent price drop but potential buying interest; maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given market uncertainty and recent declines in other assets, increasing stablecoin exposure provides a safe haven."
2024-11-26 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop from near $100K has triggered profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, with analysts suggesting potential further declines. Ethereum shows mixed signals; while derivatives activity suggests bullish sentiment, its price remains under pressure. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced notable declines, with Solana facing additional bearish pressure from large sell-offs. Despite the downturn, some traders see buying opportunities, particularly in DOGE. The macroeconomic context, with a high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices, suggests a cautious market environment, favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and bearish news sentiment suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction possible.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish derivatives activity, the price remains under pressure with no clear buy signals. Hold current position.

SOL: +0.2 — Significant price drop presents a potential buying opportunity, but caution is warranted due to bearish sentiment and whale sell-offs.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the price drop, some traders view it as a buying opportunity. Maintain current position without increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to manage risk."
2024-11-26 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K as suggested by analysts. Ethereum, despite a record high in derivatives open interest indicating bullish sentiment, is facing downward pressure, reflected in its price breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen substantial declines, with Solana impacted by a large whale sell-off and Dogecoin experiencing a sharp drop despite some traders viewing it as a buying opportunity. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. The lack of current holdings allows for a negative score, reflecting a preference to avoid exposure until stabilization.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the bearish price action, the record open interest in derivatives indicates potential bullish sentiment. Maintaining a slight positive bias due to existing holdings and market interest.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off create a bearish outlook. Current holdings justify a reduction in exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.2 — The sharp decline and bearish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, although some traders remain optimistic about future recovery.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish market environment, increasing USDT holdings provides a safe haven, reflecting a preference for stability and capital preservation."
2024-11-26 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent attempt to breach the $100K mark was met with profit-taking, leading to a sharp decline, and analysts are wary of further downside risks. Ethereum, despite witnessing record open interest in derivatives, has also faced price pressure, though the increased USDT supply on its network is a positive sign. Solana has experienced a notable price drop due to a major sell-off, raising concerns about its support levels. Dogecoin has similarly seen a sharp decline, although some traders remain optimistic about its potential recovery. In this environment, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst the volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sharp decline and potential for further downside suggest caution. Without current holdings, no reduction is possible, but a negative outlook remains.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite price pressure, the record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate underlying strength, warranting a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.3 — The significant price drop and bearish sentiment from a whale sell-off suggest reducing exposure, given current holdings.

DOGE: -0.1 — Although some traders are optimistic, the sharp decline and lack of strong positive catalysts suggest a cautious approach with existing holdings.

USDT: +0.7 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and mitigate risk."

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop after approaching the $100K mark, coupled with warnings of potential further downside, indicates a cautious outlook. Ethereum shows some bullish sentiment with a record open interest in derivatives, yet its price remains under pressure. Solana and Dogecoin have both experienced notable declines, with Solana facing additional bearish pressure from a large sell-off. In contrast, the stablecoin USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by a high U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious approach, potentially favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines and bearish news, Bitcoin's high transaction activity suggests underlying interest. However, the potential for further downside warrants a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum's price has faced pressure, the record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on its network indicate some bullish sentiment, justifying a slight positive allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — The significant price drop and large sell-off by a whale suggest bearish sentiment, warranting a reduction in exposure to Solana.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite a sharp decline, some traders remain bullish. However, given the broader market weakness, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and potential for further declines in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."
2024-11-26 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin recently experienced a significant drop after approaching the $100K mark, indicating potential profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection. Analysts are cautious about further declines, particularly with a price gap suggesting weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although the broader market correction affects its price. Solana and Dogecoin have both faced price declines, with Solana experiencing a notable whale sell-off and Dogecoin seeing a sharp drop despite bullish trader sentiment. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating a neutral stance in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. Lack of current holdings allows for a neutral to slightly negative stance.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the broader market correction, the record open interest in derivatives indicates bullish sentiment, justifying a slight positive allocation.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure. Current holdings suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent price drop but bullish sentiment among traders. Maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish tilt in the market and potential for further declines, increasing stablecoin holdings provides a safe haven and capital preservation strategy."
2024-11-26 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin recently experiencing a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity. Solana is under bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale, while Dogecoin, despite a recent sharp drop, is seen by some as a buying opportunity. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, but the high U.S. Dollar Index suggests a strong dollar, which could impact crypto demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside as indicated by analysts suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not attractive for new allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Record open interest and bullish sentiment in derivatives markets indicate potential for upward movement. Current holdings should be maintained or slightly increased.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent whale sell-off and price drop suggest bearish pressure. Current holdings should be cautiously maintained, with no additional allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent volatility, the launch of a DOGE ETP and mixed sentiment provide no clear directional bias. Maintain current holdings.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for further downside in other assets, maintaining or slightly increasing USDT holdings provides a hedge against volatility."
2024-11-26 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure. Current holdings suggest a cautious reduction.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with recent price drop and new ETP launch. Maintain current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential for further downside in BTC, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation for risk management is prudent."
2024-11-26 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin, after nearing the $100K mark, has experienced a significant pullback, with analysts warning of further downside risks. Ethereum, on the other hand, shows bullish sentiment with a record open interest in derivatives, indicating rising trader activity. Solana is under pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale and broader market correction, while Dogecoin's recent drop is seen by some as a buying opportunity despite the broader market weakness. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Recent price drop and potential further downside suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction possible.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong derivatives activity and USDT supply increase on Ethereum indicate bullish sentiment and potential for upward movement.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent whale sell-off and price drop suggest bearish pressure. Current holdings should be reduced cautiously.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the price drop, some view it as a buying opportunity, but mixed sentiment warrants a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential downside risks in other assets, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin exposure is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a recent downturn in prices across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K highlights profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, signaling potential bearish sentiment. Ethereum shows mixed signals with a record high in derivatives open interest, suggesting bullish sentiment, but recent price declines indicate caution. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced significant price drops, with Solana facing additional bearish pressure from a large whale sell-off. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction possible.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price declines, the record open interest in derivatives indicates potential bullish sentiment, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure. Current holdings suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite some bullish sentiment, the recent sharp price drop and low on-chain activity suggest caution. Current holdings allow for a slight reduction.

USDT: +0.5 — Market volatility and bearish sentiment across other assets increase the attractiveness of holding stablecoins for capital preservation."
2024-11-26 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum, despite a record in open interest, shows mixed signals with a recent price decrease. Solana is facing bearish pressure due to a major sell-off and weak ecosystem performance. Dogecoin, despite launching a new ETP, has seen a sharp decline, although some traders remain optimistic. In this environment, Tether (USDT) remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings allow for a conservative stance.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price decline, the record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate potential for recovery.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and bearish pressure from a whale sell-off suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.1 — While there's optimism from the ETP launch, the recent sharp decline warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins is prudent to preserve capital."
2024-11-26 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has recently experienced a sharp drop after approaching the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K is being eyed by analysts. Ethereum shows mixed signals with a record in derivatives open interest, indicating increased trader activity, but its price remains volatile. Solana is facing bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale, while Dogecoin, despite its recent price drop, has seen some positive developments with the launch of a new ETP. In contrast, USDT remains stable with no significant news, but its market position on Ethereum has strengthened.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the risk of further downside due to profit-taking and weakening demand suggests caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Rising open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate potential bullish sentiment, although price volatility remains a concern.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant sell-off by a whale and broader market correction create bearish pressure, making it less attractive in the short term.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent drop, the launch of a new ETP and bullish trader sentiment suggest a neutral stance as the market digests these developments.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-11-26 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bearish and bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand, which could lead to further downside. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with a record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity. However, Solana is under pressure due to a major sell-off and broader market correction. Dogecoin, despite a sharp decline, has seen some positive sentiment with the launch of a new ETP, suggesting potential buying interest. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent significant price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. Lack of current holdings allows for a negative score.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from record derivatives open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a positive outlook.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent price drop and major sell-off by a whale indicate bearish pressure, though current holdings limit the negative score.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility, the launch of a new ETP provides some positive sentiment, balancing the outlook.

USDT: +0.2 — In light of market uncertainty and potential downside in other assets, maintaining a stable position in USDT is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant drop after approaching the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although it is not immune to the broader market correction. Solana faces bearish pressure due to a major sell-off and a weak ecosystem performance, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp decline, sees some traders viewing it as a buying opportunity. The macroeconomic context, with a high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices, suggests cautious market conditions, favoring safe-haven assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Given the recent sharp decline and potential for further downside, it's prudent to avoid exposure to BTC at this time.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the broader market correction, the record open interest in ETH derivatives indicates bullish sentiment, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — The significant sell-off and bearish news suggest reducing exposure to SOL, especially with key support levels being tested.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the launch of a DOGE ETP, the recent price drop and mixed sentiment suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT as a safe-haven asset is advisable."
2024-11-26 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with significant volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop after nearing the $100K mark, with analysts predicting further downside potential. Ethereum, however, is seeing increased activity in its derivatives market, indicating bullish sentiment despite the broader market correction. Solana is under pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale, while Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline but maintains some bullish sentiment due to new financial products. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction is possible, but not a priority for new allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the broader market correction, the record open interest in derivatives indicates bullish sentiment, making it a relatively attractive option.

SOL: -0.2 — The significant sell-off and bearish pressure suggest caution. Current holdings are minimal, so a slight reduction is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent volatility, the launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment provide a balanced outlook. Hold current position.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of market volatility and potential downside in other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation is prudent for stability and liquidity."
2024-11-27 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana is also showing strength, with new highs and significant DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, indicating robust market interest. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap gains driven by speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether maintains its dominance in the stablecoin market, with a focus on regulatory compliance in the EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, supported by significant market stabilization efforts, suggest a favorable environment for BTC allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Record futures open interest and increased activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making ETH an attractive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price action and significant DEX volume highlight strong market interest, supporting a moderate increase in SOL allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative interest and market cap gains, DOGE faces resistance at $0.40, warranting a neutral stance until clearer direction emerges.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-11-27 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This recovery has renewed bullish sentiment, supported by significant market interventions that stabilized the market after a large sell-off. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity, reflecting growing market confidence. Solana continues to show strength, with new highs and significant decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surpassing Ethereum's, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired, signaling a shift in focus under evolving regulations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, along with significant market stabilization efforts, suggest a positive outlook. However, the lack of a clear buy signal from technical indicators tempers the score slightly.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new highs and impressive DEX volume highlight its growing market presence and positive momentum, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: 0.2 — While Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, the lack of a clear breakout or reversal signal suggests a cautious approach, maintaining a neutral to slightly positive stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, there is a strategic opportunity to rotate some capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher growth potential."
2024-11-27 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is also showing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest reaching record levels, indicating growing market confidence. Solana continues to perform well, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains a dominant force in the stablecoin market, though its focus is shifting due to regulatory changes in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and strong market support following a significant sell-off suggest a bullish outlook. The renewed sentiment and large market positions provide confidence in further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures interest and increased activity signal strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's continued rally and impressive DEX volume indicate robust market interest and potential for further price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderate bullish signal, warranting cautious optimism.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT aligns with the current market sentiment."
2024-11-27 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding significantly after a recent dip and nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed optimism among investors. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures activity and open interest, indicating strong bullish momentum and market confidence. Solana continues to perform well, with significant on-chain and derivatives support, pushing its price higher and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, driven by market cap growth and speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired, reflecting a shift in focus due to regulatory changes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and the stabilization of the market after a significant sell-off indicate a renewed bullish sentiment. The positive news and on-chain activity support further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market confidence suggest strong bullish momentum. The recent price breakout above the upper Bollinger Band further supports a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong performance, supported by high DEX volume and positive on-chain data, indicates continued bullish momentum. The potential to reach new highs adds to its attractiveness.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's approach to a key resistance level, combined with increased market cap and speculative interest, suggests potential for further gains, though with some caution due to resistance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market showing bullish tendencies, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT and into more volatile assets to capture potential upside."
2024-11-27 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-27 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strong upward momentum. Bitcoin has rebounded significantly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed investor confidence. Ethereum is also experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong bullish sentiment and increased market activity. Solana continues to gain traction, with its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, highlighting its growing ecosystem. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with speculation around its market cap surpassing major companies. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite regulatory shifts in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and strong on-chain activity, coupled with positive news, suggest a continued upward trajectory. The recent stabilization after a sell-off further supports a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.9 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and price breakout above the upper Bollinger Band indicate strong bullish momentum. The surge in market confidence and activity supports a high allocation score.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new price highs and significant DEX volume underscore its growing market presence and bullish sentiment. The technical indicators also support further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the positive sentiment from market cap achievements and speculative interest suggests potential for further upside, albeit with caution.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT holdings in the portfolio."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with notable upward momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing significant growth in futures open interest, indicating strong market confidence. Solana continues to rally, supported by robust on-chain and derivatives data, and is eyeing a new high. Dogecoin is also gaining traction, testing a key resistance level with potential for a breakout. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its dominance in the stablecoin market reinforced by a supply increase.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong rebound and bullish sentiment, with significant on-chain activity and positive news supporting further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Record futures open interest and increased market confidence suggest continued upward momentum.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong rally supported by on-chain data and increased DEX volume, indicating further potential for growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with potential for a breakout, supported by positive market cap developments.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation away from stablecoins like USDT is likely, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-11-27 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a significant $15T position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting a record high, indicating growing market confidence. Solana is also performing well, reaching new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with its market cap boosted by speculation and interest from high-profile figures. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin, EURt, as the focus shifts under new EU regulations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and renewed bullish sentiment, supported by significant market stabilization efforts. Positive news and technical indicators suggest further potential for growth.

ETH: +0.7 — Record futures open interest and increased activity indicate strong bullish momentum. The asset is well-positioned for continued gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive on-chain and derivatives data, along with high DEX volume, support a bullish outlook. The asset is showing strong performance and potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with potential for a breakout. Market cap growth and positive sentiment from influential figures add to its appeal.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment turns bullish, there is a rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-11-27 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a significant $15T position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues its upward trajectory, driven by high DEX volumes and strong on-chain support, while Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its focus is shifting due to regulatory changes. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong S&P 500, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's recent rebound and strong market support, along with positive news, indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's record futures interest and increased activity suggest strong bullish momentum, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.9 — Solana's new highs and leading DEX volume highlight its strong performance, making it highly attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, its market cap growth and speculative interest provide moderate upside potential.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a shift away from stablecoins, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2024-11-27 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding towards the $100K mark after a recent dip, supported by significant market interventions. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to show strength, reaching new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, indicating robust demand. Dogecoin, buoyed by speculative interest and celebrity endorsements, is testing key resistance levels. Meanwhile, Tether remains a stable cornerstone in the market, with its supply increasing as it maintains dominance among stablecoins. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, providing a supportive backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and strong market intervention signal renewed bullish sentiment, supported by positive news and technical indicators.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased activity suggest strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's strong performance, new highs, and leading DEX volume highlight its growing market presence and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price fluctuations, Dogecoin's market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderate bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, maintaining high USDT exposure is less attractive in the current environment."
2024-11-27 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by significant market stabilization efforts. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues its upward trajectory, driven by strong on-chain support and high DEX volumes, even surpassing Ethereum in this regard. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap growth fueled by speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there is a noticeable shift towards riskier assets as market confidence grows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum with renewed market confidence and significant stabilization efforts. The positive news and technical indicators support further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's strong futures activity and increased on-chain activity indicate a bullish trend, although slightly less pronounced than Bitcoin's current momentum.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's strong on-chain support and high DEX volumes suggest continued upward movement, with potential to reach new highs.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, the speculative interest and market cap growth provide some positive sentiment, though not as strong as other assets.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market shifts towards riskier assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected, reducing its relative attractiveness in the current bullish environment."
2024-11-27 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-27 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark again, supported by a large position that stabilized the market after a recent sell-off. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong bullish momentum and renewed optimism. Solana continues to rally, with its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, highlighting strong market interest. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, USDT remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there is a noticeable shift towards riskier assets as market confidence grows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with a potential breakout nearing $100K, supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.7 — Record futures open interest and increased market confidence signal strong bullish sentiment, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive price action and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume indicate strong market support and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with potential for a breakout, supported by market cap growth and speculative interest.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment turns bullish, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into riskier assets, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-11-27 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong market confidence and bullish momentum. Solana continues to perform well, with its price nearing $300 and DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, driven by increased memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap growth fueled by speculation and support from influential figures. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although the focus is shifting due to regulatory changes in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong rebound and bullish news sentiment, along with positive technical indicators, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Record futures open interest and strong market confidence support further gains, despite slightly less aggressive momentum compared to BTC.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong price action and DEX volume growth indicate robust demand and potential for further price increases.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with potential for a breakout, but less certainty compared to other assets due to speculative nature.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-27 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a bullish sentiment, with significant upward momentum across major assets. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly, nearing the $100K mark, supported by substantial market interventions that stabilized recent volatility. Ethereum is also showing robust growth, with record futures open interest indicating strong market confidence. Solana continues to gain traction, reaching new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, driven by increased trading activity. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by speculative interest, while Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite regulatory shifts affecting its euro counterpart.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with positive news and technical indicators, suggesting further upside potential. The recent rebound and stabilization efforts enhance confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures interest and increased on-chain activity signal strong market confidence, supporting a positive outlook despite recent price stability.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new highs and leading DEX volume highlight its growing market presence and potential for continued gains, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance, speculative interest and market cap growth provide a moderately positive outlook, warranting cautious optimism.

USDT: -0.5 — In a bullish market environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT, as investors seek higher returns in appreciating assets."
2024-11-27 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to rally, driven by high DEX volumes and strong technical indicators, while Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by speculative interest. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, which supports the current bullish sentiment. However, the U.S. dollar index remains strong, which could pose a risk to further upside in crypto prices.

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with significant on-chain activity and positive news sentiment. The potential for a breakout above $100K is high, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is supported by record futures open interest and increased market confidence. The asset is well-positioned for further gains, justifying a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong technical indicators and high DEX volumes suggest continued upward momentum. The asset's potential to reach new highs supports a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, speculative interest and market cap growth provide a moderate positive outlook, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the current bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-27 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This recovery is supported by a significant $15 trillion Bitcoin position that stabilized the market following a substantial sell-off. Ethereum is also experiencing a surge in activity and futures interest, indicating strong bullish momentum. Solana continues to gain traction, with its DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, and its price rallying towards $300. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level at $0.40, with market cap gains driven by speculation and high-profile endorsements. Meanwhile, USDT remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there is a slight shift in focus due to regulatory changes in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with significant market support and positive news sentiment, suggesting continued bullishness.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures interest and increased activity signal strong market confidence and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong on-chain and derivatives data, coupled with high DEX volume, support its upward trajectory.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderately positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, USDT's relative attractiveness decreases, though it remains a stable option."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a significant $15 trillion bet that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, reflected in record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana is also showing strength, with a new high in price and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, potentially poised for a breakout, while Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market as its supply continues to rise. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a risk-on environment conducive to growth in crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery and bullish sentiment, supported by significant market stabilization efforts, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased activity indicate strong market confidence and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new price highs and leading DEX volume highlight its growing market presence and potential for continued appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's approach to a key resistance level, coupled with positive market cap developments, suggests potential for a breakout.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into growth assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent in this bullish environment."
2024-11-27 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market is showing signs of bullish momentum, with Bitcoin rebounding towards the $100K mark after a recent dip, supported by significant market interventions. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest and on-chain activity, indicating strong market confidence. Solana continues to rally, driven by high DEX volumes and positive on-chain data, while Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels amid increased market cap and speculative interest. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired, reflecting regulatory adjustments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with renewed market confidence and significant buy signals from both technical indicators and recent news. The rebound towards $100K and stabilization after a sell-off suggest a favorable environment for increased allocation.

**ETH: +0.6** — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity reflect strong bullish sentiment. The price climb and market confidence warrant a positive allocation score, although slightly less aggressive than BTC due to its already high price levels.

**SOL: +0.7** — Solana's strong rally and high DEX volume, surpassing Ethereum, indicate robust market interest and potential for further gains. The positive technical indicators support an increased allocation.

**DOGE: +0.3** — Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level with a significant market cap boost. While speculative interest is high, the potential for a breakout justifies a moderate positive score, balancing the risk of reversal.

**USDT: -0.4** — With the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is appropriate. The focus on growth assets suggests a decreased need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-27 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting a record high, indicating growing market confidence. Solana continues to show strength, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there's a shift in focus due to regulatory changes in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and the stabilization of the market after a significant sell-off indicate a bullish trend, supported by positive news and technical indicators.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market activity suggest a strong bullish sentiment, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new highs and impressive DEX volume highlight its growing appeal, supported by robust on-chain and derivatives data.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, its market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderately positive outlook.

2024-11-27 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, supported by significant ETF inflows, while Ethereum is showing potential to reach $4,500 due to strong buying pressure. Solana is also experiencing positive momentum with a notable increase in total value locked and growing institutional interest. Dogecoin has seen a significant increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the TON blockchain suggests a strategic move to enhance liquidity, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving Bitcoin's price upward. The bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity support a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum is benefiting from bullish momentum and ETF inflows, with technical indicators suggesting further upside potential. The possibility of a short squeeze adds to the positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's ecosystem growth and the filing of a Solana-focused ETF indicate strong institutional interest and confidence, supporting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.4 — The significant increase in trading volume and positive price momentum suggest renewed investor interest, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-11-28 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, bolstered by ETF inflows and robust on-chain activity, although the impending options expiry suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with price targets set higher due to strong buying pressure and potential short squeezes. Solana is gaining traction with an ETF filing and significant growth in its ecosystem's total value locked, indicating increased investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a substantial increase in trading volume and price, reflecting renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the TON blockchain suggests a strategic move to enhance liquidity, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum, ETF inflows, and increased on-chain activity support a bullish outlook, despite cautious sentiment around options expiry.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum and positive news on potential price targets support increased allocation, with strong buying pressure evident.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest through ETF filings and significant ecosystem growth make Solana an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant trading volume increase and bullish price predictions suggest potential for further gains, warranting a positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-11-28 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent surge past $95K and Ethereum's break above $3,600 are supported by strong buying pressure and technical indicators suggesting further upside potential. Solana's ecosystem is experiencing robust growth, reflected in increased total value locked and interest from traditional investors through ETF filings. Dogecoin is also seeing renewed investor interest, with trading volumes and price predictions indicating potential for substantial gains. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with strategic expansions like launching USDT on the TON blockchain to enhance liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and institutional interest. The upcoming options expiry indicates cautious sentiment, but the overall trend remains positive.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, driven by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting a climb towards $4,500.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments with ETF interest and significant ecosystem growth, indicating strong investor confidence and potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Renewed investor interest and significant trading volume increase, with optimistic price predictions suggesting potential upside.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, though USDT remains a stable asset for liquidity management."
2024-11-28 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs indicating strong institutional interest. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K and Ethereum's break above $3,600 are supported by positive technical indicators and bullish news, suggesting potential for further gains. Solana is also experiencing positive momentum, driven by ecosystem growth and ETF interest. Dogecoin is seeing renewed investor interest with a significant increase in trading volume, although its price has recently seen a slight decline. Tether remains stable, with recent developments aimed at expanding its reach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and bullish technical indicators support a positive outlook. The recent ETF news further boosts confidence in Bitcoin's upward trajectory.

ETH: +0.7 — Positive momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and bullish technical indicators. The potential for a short squeeze adds to the positive sentiment.

SOL: +0.5 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion support Solana's positive outlook. The recent ETF filing is a significant bullish signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite a recent price decline, the surge in trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential for future gains. However, caution is warranted due to its volatile nature.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-28 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, supported by strong ETF inflows, although the impending expiry of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential to reach higher price targets. Solana is seeing increased institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by a new ETF filing and a 48% increase in total value locked. Dogecoin has witnessed a substantial increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, although it faces challenges with its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving upward momentum, although cautious sentiment around options expiry tempers enthusiasm slightly.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains are supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.4 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion, as reflected by the ETF filing and TVL growth, make Solana attractive.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant increase in trading volume and positive price projections suggest potential for further gains, despite low on-chain activity.

USDT: -0.3 — As market sentiment leans bullish, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-28 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving prices higher for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has surged past $95K, buoyed by significant ETF inflows, while Ethereum has broken the $3,600 mark, with potential to reach higher levels. Solana is gaining traction with a new ETF filing and substantial ecosystem growth, indicating strong investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed interest, although its price remains volatile. Tether continues to expand its reach despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin, reflecting a strategic focus on USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving Bitcoin's price higher, supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is benefiting from bullish momentum and ETF inflows, with potential for further gains as technical indicators suggest a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ecosystem growth and new ETF filing are positive indicators, suggesting increased institutional interest and potential for price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, the surge in trading volume and optimistic price predictions indicate potential upside, though caution is warranted.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, maintaining a lower exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-28 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K, despite the looming expiry of substantial options, suggests strong institutional backing. Ethereum is also showing bullish potential, with predictions of further price increases supported by ETF inflows and potential short squeezes. Solana's ecosystem growth and the filing for a Solana-focused ETF reflect increasing institutional interest, while Dogecoin's trading volume surge indicates renewed investor enthusiasm. However, the macroeconomic environment remains mixed, with stable U.S. dollar strength and moderate volatility, suggesting a need for balanced risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving Bitcoin's price upward, indicating a favorable environment for further gains. The market sentiment is positive despite the upcoming options expiry.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum is experiencing bullish momentum with potential for further price increases, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ecosystem growth and the filing for a Solana-focused ETF highlight increasing institutional interest, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — The significant increase in trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent in the current market environment."
2024-11-28 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant developments in both Bitcoin and Ethereum driving positive momentum. Bitcoin has seen a notable price surge past $95K, supported by strong ETF inflows and institutional interest, although a large options expiry looms, suggesting some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, breaking past $3,600 with potential to reach higher targets, backed by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting further gains. Solana is gaining attention due to a new ETF filing and a substantial increase in its ecosystem's total value locked, indicating growing confidence. Dogecoin's trading volume has skyrocketed, reflecting renewed investor interest, while Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong price surge and ETF inflows indicate positive momentum. However, the upcoming options expiry suggests maintaining some caution.

ETH: +0.7 — Breaking significant price levels with strong buying pressure and potential for further gains. Positive sentiment from ETF inflows supports allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive indicators. The new ETF filing could further boost investor confidence.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price projections suggest potential upside, though speculative nature warrants moderate allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital shifting towards other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-11-28 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K, supported by ETF inflows, indicates strong institutional backing, although the impending expiry of significant options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum with potential upside targets, supported by technical indicators and ETF inflows. Solana is gaining attention due to a new ETF filing and significant growth in its ecosystem, while Dogecoin sees renewed interest with a substantial increase in trading volume. Tether remains stable, with strategic expansions on new blockchains despite discontinuing EURT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are positive, although the options expiry introduces some caution. The overall trend is supportive of further gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further price increases make it attractive, especially with strong buying pressure and ETF inflows.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF filing are positive indicators, though recent price decreases suggest some caution is warranted.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price fluctuations, the significant increase in trading volume and optimistic price predictions provide a modestly positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, holding a large position in USDT is less attractive in the current environment."
2024-11-28 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have bolstered their prices and attracted institutional interest. Bitcoin has surged past $95K, and Ethereum is targeting $4,000, with potential for further gains. Solana is experiencing growth in its ecosystem and institutional interest, while Dogecoin has seen a substantial increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and strong equity markets, which may support risk-on behavior in the crypto space. However, the upcoming expiration of a large volume of Bitcoin options introduces some uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and price momentum, coupled with high on-chain activity, indicate a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and ETF inflows, along with positive technical indicators, suggest potential for price appreciation towards $4,000.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest through ETF filings and significant ecosystem growth support a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive sentiment from price predictions suggest potential upside, but with higher volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-28 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K, fueled by ETF inflows, indicates strong institutional backing, although the looming expiration of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also showing bullish momentum, with technical indicators suggesting potential for further gains. Solana is gaining attention due to a new ETF filing and substantial ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin's trading volume surge reflects renewed investor interest. Tether's strategic expansion of USDT on the TON blockchain indicates efforts to enhance liquidity, despite regulatory challenges affecting its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive ETF inflows and price surge signal strong institutional interest, though options expiry suggests some caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators.

SOL: +0.4 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion, as indicated by ETF filing and TVL growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price projections suggest potential upside, despite recent slight price decrease.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, USDT exposure should be reduced slightly."
2024-11-28 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Tether continues to expand its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving positive momentum. The market is optimistic despite the upcoming options expiry, suggesting potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and ETF inflows support further price increases, with technical indicators suggesting potential for a rise to $4,500.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive ecosystem developments and institutional interest, as indicated by the ETF filing and TVL growth, support a favorable outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price predictions indicate renewed investor interest, although the market remains speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, especially with positive developments in other crypto assets."
2024-11-28 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum due to significant ETF inflows and institutional interest. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, driven by ETF inflows, though the market remains cautious with a large volume of options set to expire. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as it targets $4,000 and beyond. Solana is gaining attention with a new ETF filing and substantial growth in its ecosystem's total value locked, reflecting increased investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, indicating renewed interest, though its price remains volatile. Tether is expanding its USDT offerings while discontinuing its EURT stablecoin, highlighting strategic shifts in response to regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving price momentum, making Bitcoin an attractive asset despite cautious market sentiment due to options expiry.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further price gains, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest is growing with the new ETF filing, and the ecosystem's robust growth enhances its attractiveness.

DOGE: +0.2 — Significant increase in trading volume suggests potential upside, but the asset remains speculative and volatile.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, maintaining a slightly reduced exposure to stablecoins is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has seen significant ETF inflows, pushing its price past $95K, although the upcoming expiry of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with predictions of further price increases supported by strong buying pressure. Solana's ecosystem is growing, as evidenced by a 48% increase in total value locked and a new ETF filing, indicating rising institutional interest. Dogecoin has seen a substantial increase in trading volume, hinting at renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but is expanding its reach to new blockchains, reflecting strategic growth despite regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving positive sentiment, although the upcoming options expiry suggests some caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.3 — Growing ecosystem and institutional interest, as indicated by the ETF filing and TVL growth, support a modest positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased trading volume and optimistic price predictions indicate potential upside, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of optimism, there is a slight preference for reallocating capital from stablecoins to more volatile assets."
2024-11-28 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price movements in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K, supported by ETF inflows, suggests strong institutional backing, although the upcoming $13.6 billion options expiry introduces some uncertainty. Ethereum is also showing bullish potential with strong buying pressure and predictions of further price increases. Solana is gaining traction with ETF filings and significant ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin's trading volume surge indicates renewed investor interest. In contrast, Tether's focus on expanding USDT's reach highlights its strategic pivot amid regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving positive sentiment, despite the looming options expiry. The market appears bullish, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong buying pressure and bullish predictions support a positive outlook, although technical indicators remain mixed. The potential for a short squeeze adds to the upside.

SOL: +0.4 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion are positive indicators. The recent ETF filing and TVL growth suggest increasing confidence in Solana.

DOGE: +0.2 — Significant trading volume and optimistic price predictions indicate potential upside, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing USDT exposure seems prudent, though maintaining some stablecoin holdings for liquidity is advisable."
2024-11-28 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum driven by ETF inflows. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, supported by significant ETF inflows, though the upcoming expiry of $13.6 billion in options may introduce volatility. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with analysts predicting further gains. Solana is gaining traction with a new ETF filing and substantial growth in its ecosystem's total value locked. Dogecoin has seen a remarkable increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of short-term technical buy signals, strong ETF inflows and institutional interest suggest a positive outlook. The upcoming options expiry warrants a cautious approach, but the overall trend remains supportive.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further gains, as indicated by ETF inflows and analyst predictions, make it an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.4 — The interest from the Solana ETF filing and significant growth in ecosystem TVL highlight strong institutional and investor confidence, supporting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — The surge in trading volume and optimistic price predictions suggest potential upside, warranting a moderate positive allocation despite recent volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — In light of the positive sentiment and potential for gains in other cryptocurrencies, it is prudent to reduce stablecoin exposure to capitalize on the current risk-on environment."
2024-11-28 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Solana is gaining attention due to a new ETF filing and significant growth in its ecosystem's total value locked, indicating robust investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest and potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, although it is discontinuing its EURT stablecoin due to regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.7 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving positive sentiment, despite cautious market sentiment due to options expiry.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and strong buying pressure.

SOL: +0.6 — Growing institutional interest and significant ecosystem growth suggest strong potential for further appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Increased trading volume and positive price predictions indicate renewed investor interest, though speculative in nature.

USDT: -0.3 — Capital rotation into riskier assets as market sentiment improves, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-28 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant increase in trading volume and optimistic future price predictions suggest potential for gains, although the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment towards other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to reallocate capital towards growth assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent surge past $95K, fueled by ETF inflows, indicates strong institutional backing, although the upcoming expiration of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as it targets higher price levels. Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF filing reflect increasing institutional interest, while Dogecoin's trading volume surge suggests renewed investor enthusiasm. Despite these positive developments, the macroeconomic context, including a high U.S. dollar index and stable gold prices, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving positive sentiment, though caution is warranted due to upcoming options expiry.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators pointing to higher price targets.

SOL: +0.4 — Growing institutional interest and robust ecosystem growth make Solana an attractive option, though technical indicators remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant increase in trading volume and positive price predictions suggest potential upside, though technical signals are currently neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, maintaining a lower exposure to stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-28 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has seen a notable price surge past $95K, supported by ETF inflows, though the impending expiry of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with analysts predicting further gains. Solana is gaining traction with institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by a recent ETF filing and a substantial increase in total value locked. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume and price, reflecting renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, although it has discontinued its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The strong ETF inflows and price surge indicate positive sentiment, but caution is warranted due to the upcoming options expiry.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains make Ethereum attractive, supported by strong buying pressure and ETF inflows.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as shown by the ETF filing and TVL increase, support a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — The significant increase in trading volume and price suggests renewed interest, but the speculative nature warrants a moderate score.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains neutral in the current environment, serving as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations."
2024-11-28 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K, fueled by ETF inflows, indicates strong institutional demand, although the upcoming options expiry suggests some market caution. Ethereum has broken the $3,600 mark, with potential for further gains as technical indicators point towards a possible short squeeze. Solana is experiencing robust ecosystem growth, evidenced by a 48% increase in total value locked and interest in a Solana-focused ETF. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether's strategic moves, including discontinuing EURT and launching USDT on the TON blockchain, reflect its efforts to adapt to regulatory challenges and expand its reach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving price increases, with positive news supporting further gains despite cautious sentiment around options expiry.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for a short squeeze, coupled with ETF inflows, suggest further upside potential, making it an attractive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments in ecosystem growth and ETF interest indicate strong investor confidence, supporting a favorable allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant trading volume increase and positive price predictions suggest potential for further gains, warranting a moderate allocation increase.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a strategic shift away from stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-11-28 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum is also showing bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as it targets $4,000 and beyond, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators. Solana is experiencing growing institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by a recent ETF filing and a 48% increase in total value locked. Dogecoin has seen a significant increase in trading volume, reflecting renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and institutional interest. Despite the looming options expiry, the overall sentiment remains bullish.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains driven by ETF inflows and technical indicators suggesting a move towards $4,500.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments with the Solana ETF filing and significant ecosystem growth, indicating increased investor confidence.

DOGE: +0.3 — Renewed investor interest and increased trading volume suggest potential upside, although the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets with growth potential."
2024-11-29 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable gains in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by strong institutional interest and positive news. Bitcoin's price is nearing $98K, marking one of its best monthly performances since 2021, while Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating robust investor interest. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in DeFi activity, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, and Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, likely fueled by speculative interest and high-profile endorsements. Despite these gains, technical indicators remain mixed, with most assets showing no clear buy signals, suggesting a need for careful allocation. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and no significant shifts in major indices or commodities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's strong monthly performance and nearing of the $100K mark, combined with increased institutional mining activity, suggest continued upward potential, though technical indicators are not yet fully supportive.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, the significant inflows into Ethereum ETFs and its recent price highs indicate a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and the resumption of U.S. trading on Bitstamp provide a bullish backdrop, supported by positive momentum signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of strong technical signals and its speculative nature suggest a cautious approach, though high-profile discussions could sustain interest.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent, though maintaining a stable reserve is still necessary for flexibility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and experiencing its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum is also seeing strong inflows into ETFs, indicating growing institutional interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see significant minting activity, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and bullish sentiment, supported by significant price gains and institutional mining activity. The potential to reach $100K makes it highly attractive.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong institutional interest, though mixed signals from the founder warrant some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Benefiting from increased DeFi activity and resumed U.S. trading, showing strong bullish momentum and price support.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant price rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive outlook, though low on-chain activity suggests caution.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and SOL."
2024-11-29 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and experiencing one of its best monthly gains since 2021. Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, although technical signals remain mixed. Solana is gaining traction with increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, while Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, which is conducive to risk-on behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with positive news and technical indicators, suggesting continued bullishness.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, the significant ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increased DEX activity and positive news from Bitstamp support a bullish outlook, with technical indicators confirming momentum.

DOGE: +0.5 — The recent rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop, although low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm slightly.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a shift away from stablecoins as investors seek higher returns in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-29 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

The overall crypto market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and experiencing one of its best monthly gains since 2021. Institutional interest is strong, as evidenced by significant mining activity and ETF inflows. Ethereum also shows positive momentum with substantial ETF inflows, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest in the U.S., pushing its price higher. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although recent news highlights its involvement in illicit activities, which could pose regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and bullish sentiment, supported by significant institutional mining activity and nearing a key psychological price level.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest potential for further gains, despite some caution from mixed signals.

SOL: +0.6 — Benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed U.S. trading interest, indicating strong upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.2 — Significant rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop, though caution is warranted due to its volatile nature.

2024-11-29 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, the significant ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to recent pullbacks.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive news from Bitstamp and strong DeFi activity, along with bullish technical indicators, make it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of strong technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a more cautious approach despite positive sentiment.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets to capitalize on potential gains."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, which have seen substantial gains in November. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum, while experiencing a slight pullback, has seen record inflows into its ETFs, indicating strong investor interest. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp, further boosting its price. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, partly fueled by discussions involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news sentiment, with Bitcoin nearing a significant psychological level of $100K. Institutional interest remains high.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite a slight pullback, the record inflows into Ethereum ETFs suggest strong investor confidence, warranting a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments with increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on Bitstamp support continued upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant rally in November and ongoing discussions involving influential figures provide strong bullish sentiment.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a rotation out of stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-29 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and recording its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021. Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi volume has surpassed Ethereum's, highlighting its growing ecosystem. Dogecoin has rallied significantly, driven by broader crypto gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with bullish technical indicators and positive news about institutional mining activity. Its recent price surge suggests continued capital inflow.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price pullbacks, the significant ETF inflows indicate strong institutional interest, supporting a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's re-enabled trading in the U.S. and its impressive DeFi activity provide a strong bullish case, supported by technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, the lack of strong technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a cautious approach despite positive news.

USDT: -0.5 — With the overall bullish sentiment in the market, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2024-11-29 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant gains in Bitcoin and Dogecoin over November. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, though recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana's DeFi activity is robust, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, and recent trading resumption on Bitstamp has bolstered its price. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, largely driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Tether continues to see high demand, with substantial minting activity, although recent news highlights its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional mining activity support a positive outlook. The potential to reach $100K further enhances its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent pullbacks, strong ETF inflows and reaching a five-month high suggest a cautiously optimistic stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive developments from Bitstamp and strong DeFi activity make Solana an attractive option in the current market.

DOGE: +0.2 — Significant rally in November and potential regulatory discussions provide a moderate positive outlook, though the recent price decrease warrants caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent."
2024-11-29 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the potential regulatory discussions add some uncertainty. However, the overall market sentiment remains positive.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark and recording one of its best monthly gains since 2021. Institutional interest is evident with significant mining activity and ETF inflows, particularly for Ethereum, which saw record inflows. Solana's resurgence is marked by increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp, while Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Despite these bullish trends, the macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, suggesting a favorable backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional interest, coupled with positive news, suggest continued bullishness.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are neutral, significant ETF inflows and recent price highs support a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in trading activity and DeFi volume, along with bullish technical indicators, warrant increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a bullish outlook, despite low on-chain activity.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the strong bullish sentiment across other assets, a rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has experienced a notable increase, nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, although its price movement remains cautious due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest in the U.S., while Dogecoin has surged significantly, fueled by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns arise from its involvement in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, coupled with positive news on mining activity and nearing a significant psychological price level, suggests further potential gains.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite strong ETF inflows, Ethereum's price movement is cautious, and technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive developments in DeFi activity and resumed trading in the U.S. provide a strong case for increased allocation, supported by bullish technical signals.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's significant price surge and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive outlook, though the low on-chain activity tempers the score slightly.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher return potential."
2024-11-29 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and showing strong upward momentum, supported by institutional mining activity. Ethereum has seen significant ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, though recent mixed signals from its founder have introduced some caution. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum's DEX volume. Dogecoin has had a massive rally, driven by broader crypto gains and potential regulatory discussions involving Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although recent news of its use in illicit activities could pose a reputational risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, coupled with positive news and on-chain activity, makes it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite strong ETF inflows, mixed signals from the founder and less bullish technicals suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — The resumption of trading on Bitstamp and strong DeFi activity support a positive outlook, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — While the recent rally is impressive, the lack of significant on-chain activity and potential regulatory discussions suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With a bullish market sentiment, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."
2024-11-29 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing a psychological milestone of $100K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating growing institutional interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana has seen a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the DeFi space, outperforming Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, buoyed by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Tether remains stable but faces scrutiny over its involvement in illicit activities, although demand for USDT remains high. The macroeconomic environment, with relatively low volatility and stable interest rates, supports a risk-on sentiment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, nearing a significant price milestone, and positive institutional mining news suggest continued bullishness.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite a slight pullback, the record ETF inflows highlight strong institutional interest, supporting a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's re-enabled trading on Bitstamp and impressive DeFi activity provide a strong bullish signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — While DOGE has rallied significantly, the potential regulatory discussions introduce some uncertainty, warranting a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing risk-on behavior, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive sentiment, marking one of its best monthly performances since 2021. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although mixed signals from its founders have introduced some caution. Solana's DeFi activity has surged, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, and recent trading resumption on Bitstamp has further boosted its price. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, with notable interest from influential figures like Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, despite some negative news regarding its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by institutional mining and nearing a significant psychological price level, makes it highly attractive.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed founder signals, the substantial ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, though with some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — The resumption of trading on Bitstamp and strong DeFi activity provide a solid bullish case for Solana.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the potential for volatility and lack of sustained on-chain activity suggest a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum and positive news across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and a substantial monthly gain. Ethereum has seen record inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although there are mixed signals from its founders. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi volume has surpassed Ethereum's. Dogecoin has rallied significantly, supported by potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although it faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, significant price gains, and positive institutional activity suggest a continued bullish trend. The approach towards $100K further supports increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from its founders, Ethereum's ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate a favorable outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's re-enabled trading in the U.S. and impressive DeFi activity provide a strong bullish case, justifying a higher allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, the lack of substantial new developments in the past hour suggests a cautious but positive stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the current bullish market sentiment, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on growth opportunities in other assets."
2024-11-29 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and robust market sentiment. Ethereum has seen record inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founder. Solana is experiencing a resurgence with increased DeFi activity and renewed trading in the U.S., while Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, buoyed by potential discussions with lawmakers. Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although there are concerns about its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with significant on-chain activity and positive news, making it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite a slight pullback, Ethereum's ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increased DeFi activity and renewed trading in the U.S. provide a strong case for capital allocation, supported by positive technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the potential regulatory discussions introduce some uncertainty, suggesting a cautious but positive stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on the current risk-on environment."
2024-11-29 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and a notable monthly gain. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating robust investor interest, although there are mixed signals from its founders. Solana is experiencing increased activity, particularly in DeFi, with Bitstamp resuming its trading in the U.S., further boosting its price. Dogecoin has also seen a massive rally, partly due to high-profile discussions involving Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to play a crucial role in liquidity, despite concerns over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional interest, along with a significant monthly gain, suggest continued bullishness.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate a favorable outlook, though mixed founder signals warrant some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Resumed trading in the U.S. and strong DeFi activity provide a bullish backdrop, supporting further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite a recent surge, ongoing discussions and potential regulatory attention suggest a moderate approach.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment shifts towards risk-on, there is a tendency to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-11-29 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with notable gains across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin, which have shown significant price increases in November. Bitcoin's approach to the $100K mark and Ethereum's strong ETF inflows highlight a robust appetite for risk assets. Solana's resurgence in DeFi activity and trading volume further supports the positive sentiment, while Dogecoin's rally reflects speculative interest. However, the macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could temper some of the bullish momentum. Tether's continued minting suggests ongoing demand for liquidity, although its involvement in illicit activities could pose risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by bullish news and significant on-chain activity, suggests further upside potential. The approach to $100K is psychologically significant, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite a slight pullback, Ethereum's ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate positive sentiment. The asset remains attractive, though slightly less so than Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive developments, including increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on Bitstamp, support a favorable outlook. The asset is well-positioned for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, its speculative nature and recent political discussions suggest a more cautious approach. However, the momentum warrants a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing strong bullish signals, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings. Capital rotation into more volatile assets is advisable, though maintaining some liquidity is prudent."

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and Ethereum ETFs seeing significant inflows, indicating strong investor interest. Bitcoin's price and on-chain activity show robust upward momentum, supported by positive news on institutional mining. Ethereum, while experiencing a slight pullback, remains strong with ETF inflows. Solana benefits from renewed trading activity and impressive DeFi volumes, suggesting a healthy ecosystem. Dogecoin has seen a substantial rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, though it faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin exhibits strong upward momentum and positive on-chain activity, supported by bullish news and nearing a significant psychological price level.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite a slight pullback, Ethereum's strong ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive news on trading resumption and high DeFi activity indicate strong market interest and potential for price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's significant rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive outlook, though its speculative nature warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With the current bullish market sentiment, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, despite high demand and recent minting activity."
2024-11-29 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, supported by strong institutional mining activity and a notable monthly gain. Ethereum is experiencing record ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp, which has bolstered its price. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by substantial minting activity, although there are concerns about its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is displaying strong bullish momentum with significant price gains and increased on-chain activity. Positive news regarding institutional mining further supports an upward allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from its founders, Ethereum's record ETF inflows and recent price performance suggest a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and the resumption of U.S. trading on Bitstamp provide a favorable environment for growth, justifying a positive allocation score.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's substantial rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive sentiment, though its high volatility suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing a bullish trend, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, prompting a slight decrease in USDT allocation to free up capital for higher-growth assets."
2024-11-29 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable rally, nearing $98K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi activity has surpassed Ethereum, highlighting its growing ecosystem. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader crypto gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to play a crucial role in liquidity, despite some negative news regarding its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, coupled with positive institutional activity and nearing a significant price milestone, makes it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed founder signals, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, though with some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — The resumption of U.S. trading and significant DeFi volume highlight Solana's growing market presence, making it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the potential for regulatory discussions introduces some uncertainty, warranting a moderate positive score.

USDT: -0.4 — With the bullish sentiment across cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark and showing strong institutional mining activity. Ethereum has seen significant inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is experiencing a resurgence, with Bitstamp resuming trading in the U.S. and its DeFi activity surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin has had a massive rally, driven by broader crypto gains and potential regulatory discussions involving Elon Musk. Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting, although it faces scrutiny due to its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news on mining activity and price gains suggest continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Significant ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong investor interest, despite some cautionary signals.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments with U.S. trading resumption and strong DeFi activity support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Massive recent gains and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop, though the rally may be overextended.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and Ethereum ETFs seeing significant inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. Solana's DeFi activity is surpassing Ethereum, and Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally. However, some caution is warranted due to mixed signals and potential pullbacks. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, which supports risk-on sentiment across cryptocurrencies. Tether continues to see high demand, although recent news highlights its use in illicit activities, which could impact its perceived safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with significant on-chain activity and positive news around price gains and institutional mining. The macro environment supports continued bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a favorable outlook. However, caution is advised due to potential pullbacks.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp in the U.S. are positive indicators, supporting capital allocation to SOL.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the low on-chain activity and recent price volatility suggest a more cautious approach. News of discussions with lawmakers could provide future support.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark and Ethereum experiencing significant ETF inflows. Solana is also seeing positive developments with increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on major platforms. Dogecoin has rallied significantly, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and supportive conditions for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong bullish momentum with significant price gains and positive institutional mining activity, suggesting further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong demand, though mixed signals from founders suggest some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on Bitstamp are positive indicators, supporting a bullish stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent gains, Dogecoin's low on-chain activity and potential regulatory discussions warrant a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins is advisable."
2024-11-30 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, though its dominance is decreasing as investors shift towards altcoins, indicating a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum is focusing on scalability improvements, which could enhance its long-term value proposition. Solana is experiencing a price correction but maintains a bullish outlook, supported by positive AI forecasts. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet DeFi and trading demands, highlighting the growing importance of stablecoins in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to the $100K mark indicate continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's focus on scalability with the Pectra upgrade and stable price movements suggest a positive outlook, though momentum signals remain neutral.

SOL: +0.2 — Although experiencing a price correction, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive forecasts support a modest allocation increase.

DOGE: +0.1 — While consolidating, Dogecoin's potential for a breakout and historical uptrend analysis suggest a slight positive bias.

USDT: 0.0 — With stablecoin demand remaining strong, maintaining current USDT levels is prudent given the market's cautious optimism and potential for increased volatility."
2024-11-30 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's dominance has decreased, indicating a shift towards altcoins, suggesting the possibility of an ""altseason."" Ethereum continues to make strides in scalability improvements, while Solana shows signs of consolidation despite a recent dip. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market remains robust, with Tether leading the charge, reflecting strong demand in DeFi and trading sectors. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, supports a risk-on sentiment, albeit with caution due to the high U.S. dollar index.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in price, Bitcoin's strong November rally and increased on-chain activity suggest continued interest, although the drop in dominance warrants caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and stable on-chain activity provide a positive outlook, though momentum indicators are currently neutral.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's recent price dip presents a buying opportunity within a generally bullish trend, supported by positive long-term forecasts.

DOGE: +0.1 — While consolidating, Dogecoin's historical uptrend potential and bullish pattern suggest moderate upside, but recent price decreases advise caution.

USDT: -0.4 — The shift towards altcoins and the overall bullish sentiment in the market suggest a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, prompting a slight reduction in USDT allocation."
2024-11-30 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is experiencing positive developments with its scalability upgrade, while Solana is consolidating after a slight dip, maintaining an overall bullish trend. Dogecoin is showing signs of potential breakout after a significant rally, and Tether continues to expand its market presence with new minting activities. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable S&P 500 and low volatility index, suggest a relatively stable risk environment, which may support continued interest in cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight pullback, Bitcoin's strong rally and the potential for further gains make it attractive, though its decreasing dominance suggests caution.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and bullish momentum signal a favorable outlook, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consolidation phase and positive long-term forecasts support a modestly bullish stance, though recent price dips suggest some caution.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a positive allocation, supported by optimistic price forecasts.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent."
2024-11-30 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has decreased as capital rotates into altcoins. Ethereum shows bullish momentum with ongoing scalability improvements and favorable legal news. Solana is consolidating but maintains a bullish outlook, supported by positive price forecasts. Dogecoin is trading within a bullish pattern, suggesting potential for further gains. Meanwhile, USDT continues to expand its supply to meet growing demand in the DeFi space, reflecting a stable and supportive environment for risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's proximity to $100K and strong November rally indicate continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum and technical upgrades provide a strong foundation for growth, supported by bullish news and potential breakout signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive price forecasts suggest continued upward potential.

DOGE: +0.2 — Trading within a bullish pattern and potential breakout, Dogecoin shows promise for further gains, supported by historical uptrend analysis.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into altcoins, maintaining a slightly reduced exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent."
2024-11-30 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, though its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is experiencing bullish momentum, bolstered by scalability improvements and favorable legal rulings. Solana shows signs of consolidation but maintains a bullish outlook, supported by positive forecasts. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, reflecting sustained demand in DeFi and trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent rally and positive sentiment, BTC's dominance is decreasing, suggesting a shift towards altcoins. However, its strong performance and proximity to $100K warrant a moderately positive outlook.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's technical indicators and recent upgrades suggest strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — While experiencing some consolidation, Solana's overall trend remains positive, supported by optimistic forecasts and stable on-chain activity.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains justify a slight positive bias, though caution is advised due to its volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent."
2024-11-30 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-30 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction, indicating a potential shift towards an ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing bullish momentum, supported by technical upgrades and favorable court rulings. Solana is consolidating after a brief dip, with predictions of continued upward momentum. Dogecoin is also consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, USDT continues to expand its market presence, reflecting strong demand in the stablecoin sector.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a strong rally, BTC's dominance is decreasing, suggesting a shift towards altcoins. However, its proximity to $100K and strong November performance warrant a moderate positive allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical upgrades provide a strong buy signal, supported by favorable news and market conditions.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive sentiment and technical signals, along with bullish forecasts, suggest potential for further gains. The recent consolidation phase offers a good entry point.

DOGE: +0.2 — While consolidating, DOGE shows potential for a breakout, supported by bullish patterns and optimistic forecasts. However, low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.2 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is advisable, though its market expansion remains robust."
2024-11-30 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall crypto market is experiencing a mixed sentiment with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its market dominance has decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with technical upgrades and legal clarity on Tornado Cash, while Solana is consolidating after a slight dip, with forecasts predicting upward momentum. Dogecoin is consolidating after a massive rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, reflecting strong demand in DeFi and trading sectors. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and no significant shifts in major indices or commodities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to the $100K mark indicate continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is supported by technical upgrades and favorable legal news, suggesting a strong position for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a slight correction, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive forecasts support a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation after a significant rally and potential for further gains suggest a cautious but positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-30 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment reflects a mixed environment with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong November rally, though its dominance is waning as capital shifts towards altcoins. Ethereum is showing bullish technical signals, supported by scalability improvements and favorable legal news. Solana, despite a recent price dip, maintains a bullish outlook with predictions of continued upward momentum. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, indicating a steady demand for liquidity and safety amid volatile market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a strong recent rally, BTC's dominance is declining, suggesting a cautious approach. However, on-chain activity remains robust, supporting a modest positive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and positive news on scalability improvements provide a bullish outlook, justifying increased exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — While experiencing a slight pullback, SOL's overall trend remains bullish with positive future price predictions, warranting a small increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent consolidation and mixed technical signals suggest holding current positions without increasing exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite grows, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."
2024-11-30 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is declining as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing bullish technical indicators and benefits from recent scalability improvements, while Solana continues to exhibit a bullish trend despite a brief dip. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether remains a stable choice, with recent minting activity indicating strong demand in the DeFi space. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets, but the low volatility index indicates a stable market backdrop.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a decline in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and increased on-chain activity support a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to the shift towards altcoins.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and recent upgrades enhance its attractiveness. The positive technical indicators and scalability improvements further bolster confidence.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's continued bullish trend and positive news forecasts suggest upward momentum, making it an appealing choice for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While consolidating, Dogecoin's potential for a breakout and historical uptrend analysis provide a modestly positive signal.

USDT: -0.3 — With growing risk appetite and capital rotation into altcoins, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable, though maintaining some as a hedge is prudent."
2024-11-30 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is benefiting from scalability improvements and favorable legal rulings, which could bolster its long-term prospects. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains a bullish outlook with predictions of further price increases. Dogecoin is stabilizing after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical trends. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet growing demand in the DeFi space, indicating robust stablecoin market growth.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight pullback, Bitcoin's strong recent rally and high transaction activity suggest continued interest, though its declining dominance warrants a balanced approach.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum with technical and fundamental support from scalability upgrades, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consolidation phase and positive long-term forecasts suggest potential for growth, but recent technical signals are mixed, warranting a moderate allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is consolidating, its historical uptrend potential and bullish pattern support a slight positive bias, though caution is advised due to low on-chain activity.

USDT: -0.4 — With growing risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent, though maintaining some USDT for liquidity is advisable."
2024-11-30 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, though its dominance has decreased as capital shifts toward altcoins. Ethereum is showing positive technical signals and is benefiting from scalability improvements, while Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase after a recent dip, but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, indicating strong demand for liquidity and safety amidst these market movements.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and high transaction activity suggest continued interest. However, caution is warranted due to the lack of a clear bullish technical signal.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's positive technical indicators and recent scalability improvements position it well for further gains, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's recent price dip and consolidation phase suggest a cautious approach, but the overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts support a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — While consolidating, Dogecoin's potential for a breakout and historical uptrend analysis support a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of risk-on sentiment and altcoins gaining traction, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2024-11-30 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K milestone after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum shows potential for scalability improvements with its upcoming Pectra upgrade, while Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase despite a generally bullish outlook. Dogecoin has been consolidating after a significant rally, with analysts predicting further gains. Tether continues to expand its supply to meet growing demand in the DeFi space. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, suggests a moderate risk appetite, which could favor a balanced allocation between risk assets and stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight dip in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to the $100K mark indicate continued bullish sentiment. On-chain activity is robust, supporting a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, but the upcoming scalability improvements and legal clarity around Tornado Cash provide a supportive backdrop for potential gains.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana is in a consolidation phase, but the overall bullish trend and positive AI forecasts suggest a moderate upside potential.

DOGE: +0.1 — Dogecoin is consolidating within a bullish pattern, with potential for a breakout. However, low on-chain activity tempers the enthusiasm slightly.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, there is a moderate shift away from stablecoins like USDT, although its role as a liquidity anchor remains crucial in volatile markets."
2024-11-30 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is decreasing as investors shift towards altcoins, indicating a potential ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing signs of scalability improvements with the Pectra upgrade, while Solana's price correction reflects consolidation amid a bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to expand, led by USDT, which remains a cornerstone for liquidity and trading demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and high transaction activity suggest continued interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive developments in scalability and legal clarity around Tornado Cash provide a supportive backdrop, though technical indicators are mixed.

SOL: +0.2 — While technical signals are neutral, the overall bullish trend and positive price forecasts support a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Trading within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout, but recent consolidation suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing exposure to stablecoins is prudent."
2024-11-30 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance is slightly waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is seeing positive developments with its scalability upgrades, while Solana is consolidating after a brief dip, with forecasts suggesting continued growth. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Tether continues to lead the stablecoin market, indicating strong demand in DeFi and trading. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a supportive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight drop in dominance, BTC's strong November rally and bullish momentum signal suggest continued potential for gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Positive news on scalability improvements and a consistent buy signal from trend indicators support a modestly bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — While technical indicators are neutral, the overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts warrant a slight positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a cautious positive stance.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment across risk assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to reallocate capital towards growth opportunities."
2024-11-30 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as capital shifts towards altcoins. Ethereum is seeing positive developments with scalability upgrades, while Solana maintains a bullish outlook despite recent price consolidation. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, indicating sustained demand for liquidity and stability in the crypto ecosystem. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a moderate risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent rally and positive news sentiment support a moderate buy signal, though caution is warranted due to decreasing dominance and potential altcoin rotation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and steady price trend suggest a favorable outlook, justifying a slightly stronger buy signal compared to BTC.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite recent price consolidation, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions warrant a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin shows potential for further gains, the current consolidation phase suggests a hold position until clearer breakout signals emerge.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing USDT exposure slightly aligns with the broader market sentiment."
2024-11-30 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its market dominance is declining as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing positive developments with scalability improvements, while Solana is experiencing consolidation but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, indicating robust demand in the DeFi space. Macroeconomic indicators such as a stable S&P 500 and low volatility suggest a relatively calm broader market environment, which could support continued interest in risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight dip in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish momentum suggest continued potential for gains. The market remains optimistic, though caution is warranted due to the shift toward altcoins.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and news about scalability improvements support a bullish outlook for Ethereum. The recent court ruling adds a layer of regulatory clarity, which is favorable for long-term growth.

SOL: +0.3 — While currently consolidating, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive forecasts support a moderate buy signal. The asset remains attractive due to its growth potential.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a cautious buy signal. However, the lack of strong technical momentum tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent. The focus remains on allocating capital to assets with higher growth potential."
2024-11-30 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has slightly decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing promising developments with scalability improvements, while Solana's price correction suggests consolidation within a bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, indicating potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether maintaining a leading position, reflecting robust demand in DeFi and trading activities. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong dollar, suggests a balanced risk environment, supporting a diversified approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and bullish momentum indicators suggest continued upward potential, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's technical indicators are supportive, and recent scalability improvements provide a positive outlook, though the momentum is less pronounced than Bitcoin's.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's current consolidation phase and lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance, awaiting clearer directional cues.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a slight positive bias, though caution is advised due to recent volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has slightly decreased as investors shift towards altcoins. Ethereum is showing signs of scalability improvements with the Pectra upgrade, while Solana is consolidating after a minor dip but remains on a bullish trajectory. Dogecoin is in a consolidation phase following a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Tether continues to expand its market share, reflecting strong demand in the DeFi space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and bullish momentum signals support a positive outlook, although recent price decreases warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's technical indicators are currently neutral, with no strong buy signals, but long-term forecasts remain positive.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern suggests potential for a breakout, though momentum signals are currently neutral.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing signs of risk appetite, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns in other assets."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce new risks amid its rapid price appreciation. Ethereum and Solana lack significant news, but Ethereum maintains a bullish momentum based on technical indicators. Dogecoin has seen a recent price increase, but lacks strong momentum signals. Tether remains stable, but its market position has been overtaken by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin dominance. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some assets showing potential for upward movement, while others remain stable or face potential risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest is a double-edged sword, but the overall bullish technical indicators suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and technical indicators support a positive outlook, despite the lack of significant news.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical indicators do not support a buy signal, and the absence of significant news keeps the outlook neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, the lack of strong momentum signals and significant news keeps the allocation neutral.

USDT: -0.2 — With some assets showing potential for growth, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by a low VIX of 13.4. The U.S. Dollar Index is at 106.21, suggesting a strong dollar, which can impact crypto markets negatively. Bitcoin's recent price action shows a slight decline, with institutional interest introducing potential risks. Ethereum maintains a bullish trend, supported by technical indicators, but lacks significant news catalysts. Solana and Dogecoin show no major technical or news-driven changes, while USDT remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a buy trend signal, the lack of bullish momentum and potential risks from increased institutional involvement suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and consistent on-chain activity support a positive outlook. No significant news, but the overall market structure remains favorable for ETH.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant technical or news-driven changes. The absence of a buy signal and stable on-chain activity suggest maintaining current exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite a buy trend signal, the lack of momentum and recent price volatility warrant a slight reduction in holdings to manage risk.

USDT: +0.2 — With no current holdings, a slight increase in USDT is advisable to hedge against potential market volatility and capitalize on stablecoin demand shifts."
2024-12-01 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which introduces both opportunities and risks, as its price shows signs of potential breakdown. Ethereum maintains a buy signal from its moving averages, but lacks significant bullish momentum and news. Solana and Dogecoin are both showing signs of weakness, with price breakdowns and no significant news to drive positive sentiment. Tether remains stable, but recent news highlights its position being overtaken by XRP in market capitalization, which may affect its perceived stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, the potential breakdown in price and lack of bullish momentum suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy signals from moving averages and stable on-chain activity provide a moderate positive outlook, though lacking strong momentum.

SOL: -0.5 — Price breakdown and lack of positive momentum or news indicate a need to reduce exposure.

DOGE: -0.4 — Significant price decrease and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure, with no supportive news to counteract the negative technicals.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish signals in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safer position amidst market uncertainty."
2024-12-01 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce new risks despite its recent price stability. Ethereum and Solana lack significant news, but Ethereum maintains a buy signal from a technical perspective. Solana shows no strong buy signals, with recent price decreases. Dogecoin has seen some price volatility but lacks strong technical or news-driven catalysts. Tether remains stable, but the news of XRP surpassing it in market capitalization may affect its perceived stability. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with a slight preference for riskier assets over stablecoins, given the technical indicators and news context.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest could drive future price increases, but current technical indicators are mixed, warranting a cautious buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy signals from technical indicators suggest a modest increase in allocation, despite the absence of significant news.

SOL: 0.0 — No strong technical or news-driven signals to justify a change in allocation; maintaining a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price volatility and lack of strong momentum signals suggest a slight reduction in exposure, given current holdings.

USDT: -0.4 — With a cautious market sentiment and some technical buy signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to reallocate capital towards riskier assets."
2024-12-01 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which introduces both opportunities and risks, especially given its recent price volatility and lack of clear bullish technical signals. Ethereum remains relatively stable with consistent buy signals from trend indicators, though momentum is lacking. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news or strong technical signals, indicating a period of consolidation. Tether's stablecoin status remains critical for liquidity, but its recent overtaking by XRP in market cap might influence its perceived stability. Overall, the macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious approach with a slight preference for risk assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the lack of strong technical signals, institutional interest could support price stability. However, the potential risks associated with this interest warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators and a stable price environment suggest a moderate increase in allocation, despite the absence of momentum.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, maintaining current exposure seems prudent as the market consolidates.

DOGE: 0.0 — The lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest holding the current position without increasing exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the stable macro environment and slight preference for risk assets, a modest reduction in stablecoin holdings is advised to capitalize on potential upward movements in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX and a strong S&P 500. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains high, which could exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which introduces both opportunities and risks. Ethereum shows a consistent buy signal despite a lack of significant news, while Solana and Dogecoin have been relatively quiet. Tether is facing competitive pressure from XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, which might affect its perceived stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest could drive long-term growth despite short-term volatility. The current technical indicators are not strongly bullish, but the increased on-chain activity suggests potential upside.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from moving averages, coupled with no negative news, make Ethereum an attractive option for capital allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and lack of significant news keep Solana in a neutral position. No compelling reason to adjust current holdings.

DOGE: -0.1 — Slightly negative sentiment due to low on-chain activity and lack of bullish momentum. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

USDT: +0.1 — Despite XRP surpassing Tether in market cap, maintaining a small buffer in stablecoins is prudent given the mixed signals across other assets."
2024-12-01 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context reflects a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could exert pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows increased institutional interest, which could introduce both opportunities and risks. Ethereum and Solana have no significant news, while Dogecoin's technical indicators suggest a neutral stance. Tether's relative stability is highlighted by its recent overtaking by XRP in market capitalization, signaling potential shifts in stablecoin dynamics. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some assets showing potential for growth amid stable macro conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for growth, but caution is warranted due to the lack of clear bullish technical signals.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators and recent price increases suggest moderate bullish potential, despite the absence of significant news.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of strong technical signals and news leaves Solana in a neutral position, with no immediate catalysts for movement.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite slight increases in price, the absence of strong technical signals and news keeps Dogecoin in a slightly bearish stance, considering current holdings.

USDT: -0.3 — With a stable macro environment and potential capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly aligns with a moderate risk-on approach."
2024-12-01 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with no significant bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's price is relatively stable, but increased institutional interest introduces potential volatility risks. Ethereum shows consistent buy signals on short-term MAs, though momentum remains weak. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news or technical signals to drive strong directional moves. Tether remains stable, but its position as a safe haven is challenged by XRP's recent market cap surge, indicating potential shifts in investor preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite stable pricing, the lack of strong technical signals and potential volatility from institutional interest suggest a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals on short-term MAs, though momentum is weak. Slightly positive outlook due to technical indicators.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to suggest a directional move. Maintain current exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of major changes in data or sentiment. Hold current position without adjustment.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the absence of strong bullish signals in other assets and potential market volatility, a slight increase in USDT allocation is prudent for risk management."
2024-12-01 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility in traditional markets, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains elevated at 106.21, which could pressure crypto assets. Bitcoin's recent price increase and bullish momentum signal suggest a potential upward trend, though institutional adoption introduces new risks. Ethereum shows consistent buy signals but lacks significant news to drive momentum. Solana and Dogecoin have seen price increases, with Dogecoin showing bullish momentum. Tether remains stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating a shift in market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite institutional risks, Bitcoin's recent price increase and bullish momentum signal suggest potential for further gains. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and slight price increase indicate a positive outlook, though lacking strong news catalysts. Maintain exposure with cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent price increase and normal on-chain activity suggest stability, but lack of buy signals tempers enthusiasm. Maintain a modest position.

DOGE: +0.4 — Bullish momentum and recent price increase support a positive outlook. Consider increasing exposure slightly.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other assets, reduce stablecoin exposure to rotate capital into higher-risk assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop, with the U.S. Dollar Index and gold prices indicating a stable dollar and a hedge against volatility. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting positive market sentiment, while the low VIX indicates low expected volatility. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows signs of bullish momentum with increased institutional interest, though this also introduces new risks. Ethereum maintains a buy signal from its trend indicators but lacks significant news to drive sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin show mixed technical signals, with Solana experiencing a recent price increase. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating shifts in market preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's bullish momentum and institutional interest suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to new risks.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators, though lacking news catalysts, suggest a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent price increase and normal on-chain activity indicate some positive sentiment, but lacking strong technical or news support.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, low on-chain activity and lack of significant news keep sentiment neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals in other assets and stable macro conditions, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2024-12-01 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows relatively stable conditions with a low volatility index (VIX) and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility but also indicates a growing acceptance. Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have no significant news, but their technical indicators show mixed signals with some bullish momentum. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and bullish momentum suggest a positive outlook, though risks remain due to potential volatility from increased institutional involvement.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals from technical indicators, despite the absence of significant news, suggest a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite no buy signal from trend indicators, the bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent price decrease and low on-chain activity; no significant news to drive sentiment.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the risk-on sentiment and bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-12-01 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable yet cautious market sentiment, with the S&P 500 and gold prices holding steady, and relatively low volatility as indicated by the VIX. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum supported by institutional interest, although this introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana show mixed signals with no significant news, while Dogecoin maintains a buy signal despite low on-chain activity. Tether remains stable, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating a shift in capital flows within the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and bullish momentum suggest potential for further gains, despite the risks associated with increased adoption.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity, but lack of significant news keeps the outlook moderately positive.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite no buy signal from trend indicators, bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a slight positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with low on-chain activity and no significant news, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With a bullish sentiment across other assets and a shift in market cap rankings, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is anticipated."
2024-12-01 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by both price and on-chain activity. Institutional interest in Bitcoin is increasing, which could introduce new risks but also signifies growing acceptance. Ethereum, while lacking significant news, maintains a positive trend signal but lacks momentum. Solana shows bullish momentum but no strong trend signal, indicating potential but not immediate strength. Dogecoin has a buy trend signal but lacks momentum, suggesting a cautious approach. USDT remains stable, but the recent news about XRP surpassing it in market cap could influence perceptions of its relative stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the lack of significant news, Ethereum's trend signal remains positive, though momentum is lacking. A moderate allocation is justified.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and consistent on-chain activity make Solana an attractive option, though the absence of a strong trend signal tempers enthusiasm slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin has a buy trend signal, the lack of momentum and significant news suggests a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment in the market, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets seems prudent, especially given the news about XRP surpassing USDT in market cap."
2024-12-01 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by both technical indicators and increased on-chain activity. However, the news of institutional involvement introduces potential risks that could affect volatility. Ethereum, while lacking significant news, maintains a stable technical outlook but lacks the bullish momentum seen in Bitcoin. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum despite lacking a buy signal from moving averages. Dogecoin's technical indicators are mixed, with no significant news to drive sentiment. Tether remains a stable option, although its relative attractiveness may be impacted by XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, suggesting a potential shift in capital allocation preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with high on-chain activity, suggest continued upward potential despite institutional risk concerns.

ETH: +0.3 — Stable technical indicators and lack of news keep Ethereum in a neutral to slightly positive position, but it lacks the strong momentum seen in Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and consistent volume suggest potential for upside, even though it lacks a clear buy signal from moving averages.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed technical indicators and absence of significant news result in a neutral stance, with no clear direction for capital allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment leans towards risk-taking, capital may rotate out of stablecoins like USDT, especially with XRP's recent market cap surpassing."
2024-12-01 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with increased institutional interest, although this introduces new risks. Ethereum is showing stable price movements with no significant news, while Solana demonstrates bullish momentum despite lacking a buy signal. Dogecoin is relatively stable with no significant news or technical changes. Tether remains a safe haven, but with XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, there might be a shift in stablecoin dynamics. Overall, the macroeconomic indicators such as a stable S&P 500 and low volatility suggest a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, favoring risk assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong upward momentum and increased institutional interest, despite potential risks, suggest a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Stable price movements with consistent buy signals, though lacking strong momentum, warrant a modest positive score.

SOL: +0.4 — Bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity, despite no buy signal, indicate potential for upward movement.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical changes results in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With a slight bullish market sentiment, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is expected to capture potential gains in risk assets."
2024-12-01 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment shows a cautiously bullish trend, with Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibiting strong technical indicators and positive momentum signals. Bitcoin's recent price appreciation is supported by increased institutional interest, although this introduces potential risks. Ethereum and Solana maintain steady on-chain activity, with Solana showing bullish momentum despite a lack of significant news. Dogecoin has experienced a significant price increase, breaking above its Bollinger Bands, suggesting potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether's stable nature remains unchanged, though its position as a top stablecoin has been challenged by XRP's recent market cap surge. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low VIX, supports a moderate risk-on environment, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, despite no significant news, indicate a favorable environment for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and a recent buy signal, though lacking news, suggest moderate potential for gains.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price breakout and increased on-chain activity indicate strong short-term bullish sentiment.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by both technical indicators and increased on-chain activity. However, the news of increased institutional involvement introduces potential risks. Ethereum and Solana are displaying bullish momentum, with Ethereum's technicals improving and Solana maintaining a steady upward trend. Dogecoin has experienced a recent price surge, indicating potential breakout momentum, but lacks significant news to support sustained growth. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, which may affect its perceived stability and attractiveness as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum, though institutional risks warrant caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's technical indicators are improving, with bullish momentum and steady on-chain activity, making it a moderate buy.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's consistent bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity support a positive outlook, despite the lack of significant news.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price surge and bullish technical indicators suggest potential for short-term gains, though the lack of news limits confidence.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings aligns with current market sentiment."
2024-12-01 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) displaying positive technical indicators such as bullish momentum and buy signals from moving averages. Bitcoin's increased institutional interest, despite introducing new risks, suggests growing confidence in its long-term potential. Meanwhile, the macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a risk-on environment, encouraging investment in riskier assets. The recent news of XRP surpassing Tether (USDT) in market capitalization indicates a shift in market dynamics, potentially affecting stablecoin demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with high on-chain activity, suggest continued upward potential. Institutional interest adds a layer of confidence.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals and bullish momentum, despite no significant news, indicate a stable positive outlook. High transaction activity supports this view.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and steady on-chain activity suggest potential for gains. The lack of significant news does not detract from its current momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite low on-chain activity, the recent price increase and bullish momentum signal a moderate buy opportunity. However, the absence of news limits the strength of the signal.

USDT: -0.5 — With a bullish market sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-12-01 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility but also suggests a growing acceptance and potential for further price appreciation. Ethereum and Solana show steady technical signals without significant news impact, while Dogecoin has seen recent price fluctuations but remains within normal trading bands. Tether's position as a stablecoin is slightly challenged by XRP's market cap surpassing it, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and consistent bullish technical signals suggest potential for further gains, despite the introduction of new risks.

ETH: +0.3 — Stable technical indicators and lack of significant news suggest a moderate positive outlook, maintaining its position within the portfolio.

SOL: +0.4 — Consistent bullish signals and stable on-chain activity support a positive allocation, with no significant news impacting sentiment.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price volatility and bullish technical indicators suggest a slight positive bias, but lack of significant news keeps the outlook cautious.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-12-01 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum signals and buy signals from short-term moving averages. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility but also indicates a growing acceptance of crypto assets. Ethereum and Solana are maintaining stable technical indicators without significant news impacts. Dogecoin has shown a slight price increase, supported by bullish momentum, while Tether's market position has been overshadowed by XRP's recent rise in market capitalization. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a balanced risk environment, although the low volatility index indicates a calm market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and strong on-chain activity support a positive outlook, but potential volatility from new risks warrants a moderate score.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity suggest a positive, albeit cautious, stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite a slight price decrease, bullish momentum and normal activity levels indicate a modest positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price increase and bullish momentum suggest a slight positive bias, but lack of significant news keeps the score conservative.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation away from stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT holdings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce new risks but also suggests potential for further growth. Ethereum and Solana have no significant news but maintain bullish technical signals. Dogecoin shows a significant price increase, indicating potential breakout momentum. Meanwhile, Tether's stablecoin status remains unchanged, but its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, reflecting a shift in market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, suggest potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — While lacking significant news, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive, supporting a moderate allocation increase.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite no significant news, Solana's technical indicators are generally positive, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price increase and bullish momentum suggest potential for further upward movement, justifying a moderate allocation increase.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals across other cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a decrease in USDT allocation."
2024-12-01 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive technical signals. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which, while introducing new risks, suggests a growing acceptance and potential for further price appreciation. Ethereum and Solana lack significant news but maintain stable technical indicators, with Ethereum showing less momentum compared to its peers. Dogecoin has seen significant price fluctuations, but its technical indicators remain bullish. Tether's position as a stablecoin is stable, though it has been surpassed by XRP in market capitalization, possibly affecting its perceived dominance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with institutional interest, suggest potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite lacking significant news, Ethereum's technical indicators remain stable, though less bullish than Bitcoin, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a positive outlook, though lacking significant news.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price volatility, technical indicators remain bullish, suggesting a cautious positive stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With overall bullish sentiment in the market, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets."
2024-12-01 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Dogecoin showing strong upward momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin's price has been fluctuating slightly, but the trend and momentum signals remain bullish, supported by increased on-chain activity. However, news of increased institutional involvement introduces potential risks. Ethereum, despite a lack of significant news, maintains a stable position with buy signals but lacks bullish momentum. Solana shows bullish momentum but lacks a clear buy signal, indicating a more neutral stance. Dogecoin exhibits strong upward momentum and potential breakout signals, suggesting increased interest. Tether remains stable, but with XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, there may be shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Strong buy signals and bullish momentum, but cautious due to potential risks from increased institutional involvement.

ETH: +0.2 — Stable with buy signals, but lacking bullish momentum; no significant news to drive strong changes.

SOL: 0.0 — Bullish momentum present, but no clear buy signal; maintain current position without significant changes.

2024-12-02 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum, despite leading in crypto fund inflows, faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price drops. Solana is experiencing some technical concerns due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization within a certain range. Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential rally, driven by bullish momentum and speculative interest. In this environment, USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is benefiting from strong institutional interest and positive technical indicators, suggesting a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor interest, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — While there is potential for price stabilization, the recent security concerns introduce uncertainty, justifying a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a 'Santa Rally' make Dogecoin attractive for short-term gains, though volatility remains a risk.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with bullish momentum observed in BTC and DOGE, supported by positive news such as MicroStrategy's continued BTC accumulation and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" in DOGE. Ethereum shows strong investor interest with significant fund inflows, although recent price momentum has been mixed. Solana faces some technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively stable S&P 500 and low volatility index, suggests a moderate risk-on sentiment, which could favor cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive news on ETF options and institutional accumulation suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price volatility, strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, although technicals are mixed.

SOL: 0.0 — While there is bullish momentum, the recent security concerns and lack of a clear buy signal from trend indicators warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and positive news about potential price rallies support a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2024-12-02 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum is experiencing mixed signals; while there are strong fund inflows, recent momentum loss has led to a price dip. Solana is facing technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend with potential for a significant rally, driven by bullish sentiment. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and no significant changes in major indices or commodities, suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF developments are driving positive momentum, supported by bullish technical indicators and increased on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence, though technical indicators remain mixed.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges and recent price volatility suggest caution, with no clear buy signal despite potential for stabilization.

DOGE: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for a significant rally make DOGE attractive, though its volatile nature warrants careful monitoring.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-12-02 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by institutional interest and ETF developments. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, yet faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price declines. Solana is under pressure from a security issue but is expected to stabilize within a broad price range. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends, with potential for further gains amid bullish sentiment. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a cautiously optimistic environment for risk assets, though the recent price volatility in major cryptocurrencies indicates a need for careful allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF-related news provide a supportive backdrop, with technical indicators showing bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: -0.1 — Security concerns and recent price declines suggest caution, though long-term stabilization is expected.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment and potential for a 'Santa Rally' support a positive allocation, despite recent volatility.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the mixed but cautiously optimistic market sentiment, a rotation out of stablecoins into riskier assets is advisable."
2024-12-02 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish developments in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin's price is supported by institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options by Cboe. Ethereum, despite leading in fund inflows, faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price declines. Solana is experiencing technical challenges with a supply chain attack, though price forecasts suggest potential stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of a volatile uptrend, with analysts predicting a potential ""Santa Rally."" The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and no significant shifts in major indices or commodities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and new ETF options provide a bullish outlook. Technical indicators also support upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence. Mixed technicals suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent security concerns and lack of bullish technical signals warrant a cautious stance. Price stabilization is expected but not guaranteed.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive momentum and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" support a bullish outlook, though volatility remains high.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with a cautious tilt towards bullishness driven by significant developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's market is buoyed by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, suggesting institutional interest and potential for upward price movement. Ethereum, despite recent price declines, is seeing strong fund inflows, indicating sustained investor interest. Solana faces technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, which could weigh on its price stability. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends with potential for a 'Santa Rally,' but faces resistance at higher levels. The macroeconomic context remains stable with low volatility, which may support risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF-related news provide a bullish outlook. Despite recent price fluctuations, the long-term trend remains positive.

ETH: +0.4 — Despite short-term price declines, significant fund inflows suggest strong investor confidence. The technicals are mixed, but the overall sentiment is supportive.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent security concerns and technical breakdowns create uncertainty. However, analysts expect price stabilization, warranting a cautious hold.

DOGE: +0.3 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and recent bullish momentum suggest moderate upside, but volatility and resistance levels temper enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive developments in BTC and ETH, there is a shift towards riskier assets, reducing the need for stablecoin holdings."
2024-12-02 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility (VIX at 13.34) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index is relatively high, which can exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing mixed signals with significant institutional interest from MicroStrategy and new ETF options, yet technical indicators are not strongly bullish. Ethereum is seeing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, but recent price declines suggest caution. Solana faces technical challenges with a recent supply chain attack, though analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing potential for a bullish rally, driven by positive sentiment and price action. Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ETF developments are positive, but technicals are mixed. Maintain moderate exposure due to potential upside.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, but recent price declines suggest caution. Slightly increase exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges and lack of bullish signals warrant a neutral stance. Hold current position.

DOGE: +0.6 — Positive sentiment and potential for a 'Santa Rally' suggest increasing exposure to capitalize on bullish momentum.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall positive sentiment and potential for gains in other assets, slightly reduce stablecoin holdings to allocate more to riskier assets."
2024-12-02 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility (VIX at 13.34) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing positive news with continued institutional interest and new financial products, which could support its price. Ethereum is seeing significant inflows into funds, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price declines suggest some caution. Solana faces technical challenges but is expected to stabilize within a defined range. Dogecoin shows potential for a rally, driven by speculative interest, but recent price volatility suggests caution. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional accumulation and new ETF options provide a bullish outlook, despite mixed technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant fund inflows highlight investor confidence, but recent price declines warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges and a lack of bullish signals suggest a neutral stance, awaiting further clarity.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a rally exists, but recent volatility and lack of strong technical support suggest moderate optimism.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally risk-on sentiment and potential for gains in other assets, reduce stablecoin exposure slightly."
2024-12-02 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears to be bearish, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing a downward trend over the past few hours. Bitcoin's price is declining, despite positive news about MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum is facing short-term bearish sentiment with significant price drops, although it has seen substantial fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest. Solana is dealing with security issues in its development ecosystem, which could impact investor confidence, despite forecasts of price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing high volatility and significant price decreases, although there is some optimism about a potential ""Santa Rally."" In this environment, USDT remains a stable choice, especially given the current market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.3** — Despite the recent price decline, positive news about institutional interest and ETF developments provide a supportive backdrop. However, the technical indicators are not currently bullish.

**ETH: 0.0** — Mixed signals with strong fund inflows countered by recent price drops and bearish momentum. Awaiting clearer direction.

**SOL: -0.1** — Security concerns from the supply chain attack could weigh on sentiment, despite forecasts of price stabilization. The overall market trend is bearish.

**DOGE: -0.3** — Significant recent price drop and high volatility overshadow potential bullish sentiment from the anticipated ""Santa Rally."" Current technicals are not supportive.

**USDT: +0.5** — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT can provide a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of cautious optimism and technical weakness. Bitcoin's recent accumulation by MicroStrategy and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options suggest institutional interest, though technical indicators remain bearish. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor confidence despite recent price declines. Solana faces risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" while Tether remains stable without significant news. Overall, the macroeconomic backdrop is relatively stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a moderate risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ETF developments are positive, but technical indicators are weak. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, despite recent price declines. Potential for recovery.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical weakness and security concerns offset potential price stabilization. Hold current position.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent price volatility suggest moderate upside potential.

USDT: -0.4 — With a moderate risk-on environment, reduce stablecoin exposure slightly to allocate more to other assets."
2024-12-02 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows potential bullish sentiment due to MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, despite recent price declines and low on-chain activity. Ethereum has seen significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price drops suggest short-term bearish momentum. Solana faces technical vulnerabilities with a compromised npm package, yet analysts predict price stabilization within a defined range. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with potential for a 'Santa Rally,' though recent price drops highlight ongoing uncertainty. The macroeconomic context, with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility, suggests a cautious market sentiment, favoring stablecoins like USDT in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF options suggest potential upside, though technical indicators remain bearish. A moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence. A slight increase in allocation is justified to capture potential recovery.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical vulnerabilities and mixed price forecasts suggest caution. Maintain current exposure until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — Volatility and mixed news suggest maintaining current holdings without increasing exposure, awaiting clearer directional signals.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the uncertain market conditions and potential for further volatility, a slight increase in stablecoin allocation is prudent to manage risk."
2024-12-02 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies, with a general lack of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing continued institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's recent purchase and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options by Cboe, which could provide a supportive backdrop. Ethereum is seeing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, but recent price declines suggest short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, though analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin shows potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" but remains volatile. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option amid uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and new ETF options provide a supportive backdrop, though technical indicators remain weak. 

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows suggest underlying investor confidence, warranting cautious optimism.

SOL: 0.0 — The supply chain attack introduces risk, balancing out the potential for price stabilization, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" offers some upside, but volatility and lack of strong technical signals suggest a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — In light of potential bullish developments in BTC and ETH, reducing stablecoin holdings to capitalize on risk assets seems prudent."
2024-12-02 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's price has seen minor fluctuations, but the news of MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options by Cboe provide a bullish backdrop. Ethereum, despite leading in fund inflows, is experiencing short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price drops. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts predict price stabilization within a broad range. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends with potential for a 'Santa Rally,' while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

BTC: +0.5 — Despite mixed technical indicators, the positive news of institutional accumulation and ETF options support a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor interest, but recent price drops warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — The potential risk from the supply chain attack balances out the forecasted price stabilization, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Volatile uptrends and potential for a 'Santa Rally' suggest a slight positive bias, but caution is advised due to high volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With no significant news and a slightly optimistic market sentiment, a moderate reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to allocate more capital to other assets."

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment reflects a mixed sentiment with some positive developments and ongoing challenges. Bitcoin is seeing continued institutional interest, highlighted by MicroStrategy's aggressive accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, suggesting a supportive backdrop despite technical indicators not yet signaling a buy. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, although recent price declines suggest short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" while Tether remains stable without significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ETF developments provide a supportive backdrop, although technical indicators remain neutral. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate positive investor sentiment, but recent price declines suggest caution. The asset remains attractive for gradual accumulation.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a recent supply chain attack, analysts expect price stabilization. The technical outlook is neutral, warranting a hold position.

DOGE: +0.2 — Volatile uptrends and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" suggest some upside potential, but the overall risk remains high. A cautious increase in exposure is justified.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to reallocate capital towards more promising opportunities."
2024-12-02 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable developments such as MicroStrategy's continued accumulation of Bitcoin and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options by Cboe, which could enhance institutional interest and support BTC prices. Ethereum is witnessing strong fund inflows, indicating investor confidence, despite recent price declines. Solana faces some technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" suggesting bullish sentiment. In contrast, the macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and no significant changes in major indices, which may support risk-on sentiment in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and positive developments like the Bitcoin ETF options launch suggest a bullish outlook. Despite technical indicators showing no immediate buy signals, the news supports a positive sentiment.

ETH: +0.5 — While recent price declines indicate short-term bearish sentiment, the significant fund inflows highlight strong investor interest, suggesting potential for recovery and growth.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent supply chain attack introduces uncertainty, but the expected price stabilization within a broad range suggests a neutral stance until further clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite its volatility, the potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent price increases indicate a cautiously optimistic outlook, warranting a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive developments in other cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT."
2024-12-02 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

Overall, the market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of bullish momentum supported by significant institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum, despite recent inflows into funds, faces mixed sentiment due to recent price declines. Solana's ecosystem faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend with potential for a significant rally. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady indicators, suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF-related developments provide a bullish outlook. Recent price momentum supports increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor interest. However, technicals remain mixed.

SOL: 0.0 — Potential risks from the supply chain attack offset by expected price stabilization. Neutral stance until more clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from potential 'Santa Rally' and recent price increases suggest a favorable outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the optimistic sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."
2024-12-02 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.2 — With a generally optimistic market sentiment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2024-12-02 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has seen positive news with MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and new ETF options, but its technical indicators are not strongly bullish. Ethereum has experienced significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest, yet its price has recently declined due to momentum loss. Solana is facing potential risks from a supply chain attack, though analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin shows volatile behavior with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" but recent price drops highlight its inherent risk. In this environment, USDT remains a safe haven, though no significant news impacts its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite mixed technicals, positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF developments suggest potential upside. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, although recent price decline warrants cautious optimism.

SOL: 0.0 — The supply chain attack introduces risks, offsetting potential price stabilization. Hold current position.

DOGE: +0.2 — While volatile, the potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent analyst optimism justify a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.5 — In light of mixed but slightly bullish sentiment across other assets, reduce stablecoin exposure to capitalize on potential upward movements in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility (VIX at 13.34) and a strong S&P 500 index, indicating a risk-on sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, supported by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, which could attract more institutional interest. Ethereum is seeing significant fund inflows, suggesting strong investor interest despite recent price declines. Solana faces some technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is exhibiting volatile behavior with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive momentum and institutional interest from ETF options and MicroStrategy's accumulation support a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest, suggesting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges from the supply chain attack and mixed price signals warrant a neutral stance until further clarity emerges.

DOGE: +0.3 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent price increases suggest a moderate buy, but volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive sentiment in risk assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2024-12-02 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index, which could exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin continues to see institutional interest with MicroStrategy's ongoing accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could support its price despite recent declines. Ethereum is experiencing significant fund inflows, suggesting strong investor interest, although recent price momentum has been bearish. Solana faces technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" with analysts predicting a bullish trend. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and new ETF options provide a supportive backdrop despite recent price declines. The overall sentiment remains positive, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest, although recent price momentum has been weak. The score reflects a cautious optimism.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the supply chain attack, the price is expected to stabilize. The mixed technical signals and security concerns suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent bullish sentiment provide a slight positive outlook, but high volatility warrants caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and potential capital rotation into other assets, holding USDT is less attractive in the current market environment."
2024-12-02 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies, with some bullish developments and technical indicators showing potential for upward movement, particularly in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin's recent news of significant institutional accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options suggests a supportive backdrop for BTC, despite mixed technical signals. Ethereum shows strong investor interest with substantial fund inflows, although recent price declines indicate short-term bearish sentiment. Solana is facing technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing bullish sentiment with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" though it remains volatile. The macroeconomic context shows relatively stable conditions with low volatility, which may support risk-on behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional accumulation and ETF-related developments provide a strong bullish backdrop, despite mixed technical signals.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, though recent price declines suggest caution is warranted.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical issues and mixed price forecasts suggest a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment and potential for a significant rally make DOGE attractive, despite its inherent volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and potential bullish trends in other assets, holding USDT is less attractive."
2024-12-02 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is seeing continued institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could drive further institutional adoption. Ethereum, despite recent inflows into funds, is experiencing short-term bearish sentiment due to a recent price drop. Solana faces technical vulnerabilities, but analysts expect price stabilization within a defined range. Dogecoin is experiencing speculative interest with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" though it remains volatile. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a neutral to slightly positive risk environment, favoring a cautious increase in risk exposure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and ETF-related news provide a strong foundation for potential upward movement, despite mixed technical signals.

ETH: +0.2 — While recent price momentum is negative, significant fund inflows indicate underlying investor confidence, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the security concerns, the expected price stabilization suggests a neutral stance, with no immediate need for allocation changes.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" provide a modestly positive outlook, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing interest in risk assets like BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin continues to see institutional interest, highlighted by MicroStrategy's ongoing accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide a regulatory boost. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating investor confidence, although recent price momentum has been bearish. Solana faces technical challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin shows potential for a 'Santa Rally,' with analysts forecasting a significant price increase. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, suggesting a balanced risk appetite among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional interest and new ETF options are strong bullish indicators, suggesting continued upward potential despite mixed technical signals.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest, although recent momentum loss warrants caution. The overall sentiment remains positive.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite technical issues, the price is expected to stabilize within a broad range. Current conditions suggest a hold strategy until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.3 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and recent bullish momentum suggest moderate upside potential, but volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2024-12-02 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.
