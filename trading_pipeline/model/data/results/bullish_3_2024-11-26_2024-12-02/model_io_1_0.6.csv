2024-11-26 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently cautious, with significant price fluctuations observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin recently experienced a sharp decline after nearing the $100K mark, primarily due to profit-taking and a potential weakening in U.S. demand. Ethereum, on the other hand, shows signs of bullish sentiment with a record high in derivatives open interest, although price movements remain volatile. Solana and Dogecoin have both faced downward pressure, with Solana affected by a major sell-off and Dogecoin seeing a significant drop despite new investment products being launched. In this environment, the stability of USDT remains attractive, especially given the broader market corrections and uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price recovery, the potential for further downside and weakening demand suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from rising open interest and USDT supply on Ethereum, indicating potential for upward movement.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent sell-off and weak ecosystem performance suggest further downside risk. No current holdings to reduce.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with new ETP launch but recent price drop; maintain a neutral stance without current holdings.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of market volatility and potential downside in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a strong position in USDT provides stability and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a pullback after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns about U.S. demand. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, suggesting increased trader activity. Solana is under pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale and broader market corrections. Dogecoin has seen a sharp drop but maintains some bullish sentiment due to new financial products. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during volatile periods.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Recent price drops and analyst warnings of further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not attractive for new allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong open interest and bullish sentiment in derivatives markets indicate potential for upward movement. Current holdings justify a moderate increase.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent price drops and bearish news, the lack of current holdings and potential support at $200 suggest a wait-and-see approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, the launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment balance the outlook, making it neutral for now.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential for further downside in major assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent."
2024-11-26 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and SOL, driven by profit-taking and broader market corrections. BTC has faced significant selling pressure after nearing the $100K mark, with analysts predicting potential further declines. Meanwhile, ETH shows signs of bullish sentiment, evidenced by record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on its network. SOL has experienced a notable sell-off, with a major whale offloading a significant amount, raising bearish concerns. DOGE, despite a sharp drop, has seen some positive sentiment due to the launch of a new ETP, suggesting potential buying interest. USDT remains stable with no significant news, but its role as a safe haven may be attractive in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price declines and bearish news suggest potential further downside, warranting caution in increasing exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from record derivatives activity and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a favorable outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent price drops and bearish news, the lack of a current position and potential for stabilization at key support levels suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: 0.2 — The launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment provide a slight positive outlook, though caution is advised due to recent volatility.

USDT: +0.3 — With market uncertainty and potential downside in other assets, maintaining a stablecoin position provides a hedge against volatility."
2024-11-26 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent attempt to breach the $100K mark was met with profit-taking, leading to a sharp decline and concerns about further downside risks. Ethereum, on the other hand, shows signs of bullish sentiment in the derivatives market, although its price has not significantly benefited from this. Solana has experienced a notable drop due to a large sell-off, adding to the bearish pressure. Dogecoin's recent launch of an ETP in the Nordics is a positive development, but its price has also fallen sharply. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a high U.S. dollar index, suggests a cautious approach, potentially favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent gains, Bitcoin's sharp drop and potential for further downside warrant caution. The lack of current holdings allows for a negative score to reflect a preference to remain out of the asset.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum's price is relatively stable, the record open interest in derivatives suggests a potential for upward movement. Current holdings justify a slight positive score.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's recent price drop and large sell-off suggest caution. Without current holdings, the score remains neutral as the market stabilizes.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite the launch of a new ETP, Dogecoin's price has dropped significantly. Current holdings justify a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and the need for stability, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2024-11-26 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears to be mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing a major psychological level of $100K, with analysts warning of potential further downside. Ethereum, on the other hand, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives and an increase in USDT supply on its network. Solana is under pressure from a recent price drop and a major sell-off by a whale, indicating potential further declines. Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline, but the launch of a new ETP in the Nordics suggests some bullish sentiment among traders. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and analyst warnings of further downside suggest reducing exposure, especially given the lack of current holdings.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from record derivatives open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off create uncertainty, suggesting a hold position until more clarity emerges.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent price drop, the launch of a new ETP and mixed sentiment warrant a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for further downside in major assets, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation for stability is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with signs of bearish pressure across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana, while Ethereum shows bullish sentiment due to increased derivatives activity. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K and potential further downside indicates caution, while Ethereum's record open interest suggests optimism among traders. Solana faces bearish pressure from a significant whale sell-off, and Dogecoin's recent drop is seen by some as a buying opportunity, despite broader market weakness. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stable assets like USDT in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but not a priority for allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a positive outlook. Current holdings can be slightly increased.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish sentiment. No current holdings to reduce, but not attractive for new allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price drop, some traders view it as a buying opportunity. Current holdings should be maintained without changes.

USDT: +0.3 — In a mixed market environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2024-11-26 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bearish and bullish signals across different assets. Bitcoin recently experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, with analysts warning of potential further downside. Ethereum, on the other hand, shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although its price has seen slight declines. Solana is facing bearish pressure due to a major sell-off and broader market correction. Dogecoin has seen a notable price drop, but some traders remain optimistic, viewing it as a buying opportunity. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating a potential safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines and bearish news, Bitcoin's historical resilience suggests a hold strategy. The potential for further downside warrants caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from record derivatives open interest and USDT supply growth on Ethereum supports a positive outlook, despite recent price fluctuations.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure, but the overall market correction suggests holding until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: -0.2 — Holding DOGE amidst recent price drops and low on-chain activity, but cautious optimism from new ETP launch and trader sentiment.

USDT: +0.7 — Increased volatility and bearish trends in other assets make USDT a preferred safe haven, supporting higher allocation in stablecoins."
2024-11-26 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, after nearing the $100K mark, has experienced a notable decline due to profit-taking and concerns over weakening demand, with analysts predicting further downside risk. Ethereum, despite a record high in derivatives open interest indicating bullish sentiment, has also seen a price decrease. Solana is under pressure from a major sell-off, contributing to its declining price. Dogecoin, despite launching a new ETP, has faced a sharp drop, although some traders remain optimistic about a potential rebound. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the significant price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings to reduce, but a negative outlook.

ETH: +0.1 — Mixed signals with high open interest indicating bullish sentiment, but recent price declines warrant a cautious approach. Maintain current holdings with slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drop and bearish pressure from a whale sell-off suggest reducing exposure if held. Currently not in portfolio, so no action needed.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, the launch of the ETP and some bullish sentiment among traders suggest holding current positions without further allocation.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-11-26 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite some bullish sentiment, significant price decline and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing the $100K mark indicates profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K, highlighting weakening demand. Ethereum shows mixed signals with a record open interest suggesting bullish sentiment, yet its price remains under pressure. Solana and Dogecoin have both experienced notable declines, with Solana impacted by a major sell-off and Dogecoin's drop seen by some as a buying opportunity. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests cautious market conditions, favoring stability over aggressive risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent bearish news and price correction, BTC remains a key asset. No current holdings mean no reduction is possible, and the potential for further downside suggests caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum indicate underlying bullish sentiment, warranting a moderate positive allocation despite recent price weakness.

SOL: +0.1 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off create caution, but no current holdings and potential for recovery suggest a slight positive bias.

DOGE: -0.3 — Significant price drop and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure, though some traders remain bullish.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining liquidity and stability with USDT is prudent, especially given the potential for further downside in other assets."
2024-11-26 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop from near $100K has triggered profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, with analysts warning of potential further declines below $90K. Ethereum shows mixed signals; despite a record in open interest suggesting bullish sentiment, its price has also been declining. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced sharp declines, with Solana facing additional pressure from a large whale sell-off. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent sharp decline and potential for further downside suggest caution. Without current holdings, a negative score is not applicable, but a cautious stance is warranted.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite the price decline, the record open interest in derivatives indicates underlying bullish sentiment, warranting a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price drop and bearish pressure from a whale sell-off suggest reducing exposure, but given the small current holding, a moderate reduction is appropriate.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite the price drop, some traders view it as a buying opportunity. However, given the current bearish trend, a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity, making it relatively more attractive."
2024-11-26 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K highlights profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, with analysts warning of potential further declines. Ethereum's open interest surge suggests increased trader activity, but price action remains weak. Solana and Dogecoin have both experienced substantial sell-offs, with Solana facing additional pressure from a whale's $23M sell-off. The macroeconomic context, including a high U.S. dollar index and stable volatility, suggests a cautious market environment. In this context, USDT remains a stable option, reflecting a preference for capital preservation amid uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and analyst warnings of further downside suggest caution. Lack of current holdings allows for a neutral to slightly negative stance, reflecting potential further weakness.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite price weakness, the record open interest in derivatives indicates potential bullish sentiment. Current holdings justify a slight positive bias, anticipating possible recovery.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish sentiment. Current holdings warrant reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — Despite some bullish sentiment from the ETP launch, the sharp price decline and current holdings suggest reducing exposure in light of broader market weakness.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining or increasing stablecoin holdings is prudent for capital preservation, given the lack of significant news and stable price action."
2024-11-26 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is predominantly bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop after approaching $100K indicates profit-taking and a potential dip below $90K, suggesting caution. Ethereum shows some bullish sentiment in derivatives markets, but overall price action remains weak. Solana and Dogecoin have both experienced notable declines, with Solana facing additional pressure from large sell-offs. In contrast, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid increased market volatility and uncertainty.

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction possible.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite bullish derivatives activity, the overall market sentiment remains weak, warranting a neutral stance.

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's recent drop after nearing $100K indicates profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection, with analysts warning of potential further declines. Ethereum shows mixed signals, with a record open interest in derivatives suggesting bullish sentiment, but price action remains weak. Solana and Dogecoin have both experienced substantial price drops, with Solana facing additional pressure from a major whale sell-off. In contrast, USDT remains stable, reflecting a cautious market environment where investors may seek refuge in stablecoins amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite no current holdings, the bearish sentiment and potential for further downside suggest caution. Analysts warn of a dip below $90K, aligning with the technical weakness observed.

ETH: +0.1 — While derivatives activity indicates bullish sentiment, the lack of positive price momentum and mixed market conditions suggest a cautious approach, maintaining a slight positive bias due to open interest records.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure, with the potential for further declines. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.2 — Despite a recent price increase, the overall bearish market sentiment and recent sharp drop suggest reducing exposure, although some traders remain optimistic.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish conditions across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for quick reallocation when market conditions improve."
2024-11-26 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with significant volatility observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp decline after approaching the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns about weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum (ETH) shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity. Solana (SOL) faces bearish pressure due to a significant sell-off by a whale, while Dogecoin (DOGE) remains volatile but has seen increased interest due to the launch of a new ETP in the Nordics. Tether (USDT) remains stable with no significant news, but its role as a safe haven could be appealing amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price increases, the risk of a further downturn due to profit-taking and weakening demand suggests caution. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from record derivative interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a moderate bullish stance. Current holdings justify maintaining exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent whale sell-off and broader market correction indicate potential downside risk. Current holdings are minimal, so exposure is maintained but not increased.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent price drop and new ETP launch. Current holdings are substantial, so maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the market volatility and potential downside risks in other assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT as a hedge is advisable."
2024-11-26 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent volatility and corrections across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant pullback after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although it has faced recent price declines. Solana is under pressure from a major sell-off and broader market corrections, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp drop, has seen some bullish sentiment due to new product launches. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a cautious market environment, favoring stablecoins like USDT for risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. Lack of current holdings limits downside exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price decline, strong derivatives activity and USDT supply increase on Ethereum indicate underlying bullish sentiment.

SOL: -0.1 — Price pressure from a significant sell-off and weak ecosystem performance, but current holdings are minimal.

DOGE: +0.1 — Despite recent volatility, the launch of the DOGE ETP and some bullish sentiment provide a slight positive outlook.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market volatility and potential downside risks, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer and risk management."
2024-11-26 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with recent price volatility and new ETP launch. Hold current position without changes.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential downside risks in other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability."
2024-11-26 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by recent price corrections across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent attempt to breach the $100K mark was met with significant profit-taking, leading to a notable drop and increased caution among traders. Ethereum, however, shows signs of bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although it too has faced some price volatility. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced sharp declines, with Solana facing bearish pressure from significant whale activity and Dogecoin seeing a drop despite new investment products. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, suggesting a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Recent price drop and profit-taking suggest caution. Analysts warn of potential further downside, making BTC less attractive for short-term allocation.

**ETH: +0.5** — Despite recent price volatility, record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT activity on Ethereum indicate strong underlying demand and potential for recovery.

**SOL: -0.5** — Significant sell-off by a whale and a 9% price drop highlight bearish sentiment. The risk of further declines makes SOL less appealing.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Although DOGE has dropped significantly, the launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment among traders suggest a neutral stance is appropriate.

**USDT: +0.3** — In light of the overall market correction and increased risk aversion, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant declines observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin's recent drop from near $100K levels has been attributed to profit-taking and weakening U.S. demand, while Solana faces bearish pressure from a major sell-off. Ethereum shows mixed signals with a record in open interest suggesting bullish sentiment, but recent price declines indicate caution. Dogecoin, despite a sharp drop, has some traders viewing it as a buying opportunity. In this environment, the stability of USDT becomes more attractive as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction possible.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price declines, the record open interest in derivatives indicates potential bullish sentiment. Current holdings justify a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drop and bearish sentiment from whale sell-off suggest reducing exposure. Current holdings warrant a negative score.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent volatility, no clear directional bias emerges. Current holdings suggest maintaining position without changes.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to mitigate risk."
2024-11-26 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with recent volatility and profit-taking affecting major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, although its price remains volatile. Solana has faced a notable decline due to a major sell-off and broader market correction, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp drop, sees some bullish sentiment due to new financial products. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market turbulence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent sharp decline and profit-taking suggest caution, with potential for further downside below $90K. No current holdings to reduce.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment from record open interest in derivatives and increased USDT supply on Ethereum, but price volatility warrants moderate caution.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent price drop and whale sell-off indicate bearish pressure. Current holdings are minimal, so exposure is limited.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a sharp price drop, the launch of a new ETP and some bullish sentiment provide a neutral outlook. Current holdings suggest holding position.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the recent volatility in other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against further market downturns."
2024-11-26 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant pullback after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening U.S. demand. Ethereum shows mixed signals with a record open interest in derivatives suggesting bullish sentiment, yet its price remains under pressure. Solana has faced a notable sell-off, exacerbated by a whale's large sale, while Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline despite some traders viewing it as a buying opportunity. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market volatility. In this environment, the macroeconomic context shows a stable U.S. dollar and low volatility, suggesting cautious market behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent price drop and analyst warnings of further downside suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction possible.

ETH: +0.2 — Record open interest in derivatives indicates potential bullish sentiment, but mixed technicals and recent price pressure warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent price drop and large sell-off by a whale suggest bearish sentiment. Current holdings are minimal, so a slight reduction is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price drop, the launch of a DOGE ETP and some bullish sentiment among traders suggest holding the current position.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2024-11-26 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price corrections observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and increased demand for downside protection. Ethereum, despite a record surge in derivatives open interest, shows mixed signals with no clear bullish momentum. Solana has faced a substantial drop due to broader market corrections and a significant whale sell-off, raising concerns about its short-term stability. Dogecoin, while launching a new ETP, has also seen a notable price drop, though some traders remain optimistic. The macroeconomic context, with a strong U.S. dollar and relatively low volatility, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent sharp decline and potential for further downside below $90K indicate a cautious approach, especially with no current holdings.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite mixed technicals, the record open interest and increased USDT supply on Ethereum suggest a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and whale sell-off create bearish pressure, warranting reduced exposure given current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent price drop but some bullish sentiment from ETP launch; maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — Favorable macroeconomic conditions and market uncertainty support maintaining higher stablecoin exposure for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bearish and bullish signals. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and concerns over weakening demand in the U.S. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with a record high in derivatives open interest, indicating increased trader activity. Solana is under pressure due to a major sell-off and a broader market correction, while Dogecoin, despite a sharp decline, sees some traders viewing it as a buying opportunity. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, suggests a neutral to slightly bearish environment, favoring a cautious approach with a potential increase in stablecoin holdings.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop and bearish news suggest caution; no current holdings to reduce, but avoid new exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish sentiment from record open interest and regained USDT dominance supports a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent sell-off and bearish pressure from whale activity warrant caution; maintain minimal exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price drop, mixed sentiment and new ETP launch suggest holding current position without changes.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the cautious market environment and potential for further downside in risk assets, increasing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-11-26 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bearish and bullish signals across different assets. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop after nearing the $100K mark, driven by profit-taking and potential weakening demand, suggesting further downside risk. Ethereum shows bullish sentiment with record open interest in derivatives, indicating increased trader activity. Solana is under pressure from a major sell-off and broader market correction, while Dogecoin is seeing mixed reactions with new investment products but also significant price drops. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop and potential for further downside as indicated by market news and technical signals suggest caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment from record derivatives activity and increased USDT supply on Ethereum supports a modest positive outlook.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent sell-off and bearish pressure from whale activity indicate potential for further declines, warranting a cautious stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with new investment products but recent price volatility; maintain current exposure without increasing risk.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of market uncertainty and potential downside in other assets, increasing exposure to stablecoins as a defensive strategy is prudent."
2024-11-27 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by significant market interventions. Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana is gaining traction with new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, indicating robust market confidence. Dogecoin, buoyed by speculation and market cap growth, is testing key resistance levels. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired, reflecting regulatory shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and the stabilization of the market following a significant sell-off suggest strong bullish sentiment. The potential for BTC to reach $100K again supports a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market confidence indicate strong bullish momentum, warranting a positive allocation despite the recent slight price decrease.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight its growing market strength and potential for further gains, justifying a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite testing resistance and market cap growth, the mixed price signals and high volatility suggest a neutral stance is prudent until clearer trends emerge.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2024-11-27 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip and nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is also showing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting a record high and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to rally, supported by strong on-chain data and significant DEX volume, while Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level amid market cap growth driven by speculative interest. Stablecoins, particularly USDT, maintain their dominance, although the focus is shifting due to regulatory changes in the EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and strong market support suggest continued bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity reflect strong bullish sentiment, warranting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rally and significant DEX volume indicate strong market interest, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent gains and speculative interest, Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, suggesting a neutral stance until a clear breakout or reversal is observed.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-27 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding towards the $100K mark after a recent dip, supported by a significant $15 trillion bet that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to show strength, reaching new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired, reflecting regulatory shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's rebound and strong market support suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and record futures interest indicate strong market confidence, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's new highs and significant DEX volume highlight its growth potential, justifying a positive allocation score.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-27 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a significant $15T position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to show strength with new price highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, indicating robust network activity. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, driven by speculative interest and market cap growth. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, though its euro stablecoin is being retired, reflecting regulatory adjustments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Renewed bullish sentiment and stabilization efforts suggest further upside potential, supported by positive news and on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum with record futures interest and increased activity make ETH particularly attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price action and significant DEX volume highlight Solana's growing ecosystem and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.2 — Testing key resistance with potential for a breakout, though speculative nature warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — As market sentiment turns bullish, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment among investors. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest and on-chain activity, indicating strong market confidence. Solana is also performing well, with its price rallying and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surpassing Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its dominance in the stablecoin market reinforced despite regulatory shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, along with significant market support, suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.9 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity signal strong bullish momentum, making it highly attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price rally and impressive DEX volume highlight robust market support, justifying a positive allocation score.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, its market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderate bullish outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, there is no immediate need to allocate capital to USDT, maintaining a neutral stance."
2024-11-27 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong market confidence. Solana has hit new highs, driven by increased on-chain activity and DEX volume, while Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. In contrast, stablecoins like USDT remain stable with no significant buy signals, as capital appears to be rotating into riskier assets amid growing risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with a recent rebound and significant market support, suggesting further upside potential.

ETH: +0.9 — Ethereum's strong futures interest and price momentum, along with increased activity, indicate a very bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's price surge and high DEX volume suggest continued strong performance, making it an attractive asset.

DOGE: +0.5 — While DOGE is testing resistance, the positive market cap growth and speculative interest provide a moderately bullish signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With the current market favoring riskier assets, USDT remains neutral as a stablecoin, with no immediate need for increased allocation."
2024-11-27 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This recovery is supported by significant market interventions, stabilizing the broader crypto market. Ethereum is also experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to rally, driven by high DEX volumes and positive technical indicators, while Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels amid speculation and increased market cap. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired, reflecting a strategic shift in focus.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and renewed bullish sentiment, supported by significant market interventions and positive news flow.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is reinforced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity, indicating strong market confidence.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive technical indicators and high DEX volumes suggest continued upward potential, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, the positive market cap developments and speculative interest provide a moderate bullish signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bullish market sentiment, there is no immediate need to allocate capital to USDT, maintaining a neutral stance."
2024-11-27 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with strong upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has rebounded significantly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again, which has renewed bullish sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures open interest, indicating strong market confidence and bullish momentum. Solana continues to perform well, with its price hitting new highs and DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap growth fueled by speculation and media attention. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired, reflecting regulatory shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, along with significant market stabilization efforts, make it an attractive asset to increase exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market confidence suggest continued bullish momentum, warranting a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's strong price performance and impressive DEX volume highlight its growing market presence, making it a favorable asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin is testing key resistance, its market cap growth and media attention provide some positive sentiment, justifying a moderate positive score.

USDT: 0.0 — Despite the overall bullish market, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent given its role as a stablecoin and the potential for quick capital rotation if market conditions change."
2024-11-27 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark again. This recovery is supported by a significant $15 trillion position that stabilized the market following a substantial sell-off. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels, indicating growing market confidence. Solana continues to show strength, with its price rallying and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surpassing Ethereum's, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, buoyed by market cap growth and speculative interest. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin has been retired.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with stabilizing market forces, suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market activity indicate strong bullish momentum and growing confidence.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's price rally and impressive DEX volume highlight its potential for continued growth, supported by strong on-chain data.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite recent price fluctuations, Dogecoin's market cap growth and resistance testing suggest potential for upward movement, albeit with caution.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as risk appetite remains balanced."
2024-11-27 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin rebounding strongly after a recent dip and nearing the $100K mark again. Ethereum is experiencing significant bullish momentum, as reflected in record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to rally, supported by strong on-chain data and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap gains fueled by speculative interest. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although there is a shift in focus due to regulatory changes in the EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with significant market support, make it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and growing market confidence suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong rally and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume indicate robust momentum, warranting a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap gains and speculative interest provide a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bullish market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as capital is likely to rotate into more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a recent dip, nearing the $100K mark, which has renewed investor confidence. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures interest and on-chain activity, reflecting strong market confidence. Solana continues to show robust performance, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, with speculation and market cap growth fueled by high-profile endorsements. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin EURt.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with supportive news of a massive market-stabilizing position, suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures interest and increased on-chain activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new highs and significant DEX volume highlight its growing market presence and potential for further appreciation, supported by positive technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's approach to a key resistance level, along with market cap growth and speculative interest, suggests potential for upward movement, albeit with caution due to resistance.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stablecoin market that remains strong but not expanding rapidly, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT aligns with the current risk-on sentiment."
2024-11-27 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is approaching the $100K mark again, supported by a massive position that stabilized the market after a recent sell-off. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels, indicating growing market confidence. Solana continues to rally, driven by strong on-chain and derivatives data, and has seen its DEX volume surpass Ethereum's. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with its market cap boosted by speculation and interest from high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish sentiment with price nearing $100K and significant market stabilization efforts. On-chain activity supports further gains.

ETH: +0.7 — Record futures open interest and surging activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making ETH an attractive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive price action and high DEX volume suggest continued upward potential, supported by strong on-chain data.

DOGE: +0.3 — Testing key resistance with potential for a breakout, though speculative interest remains a key driver.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT remains dominant, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining a neutral stance on stablecoins."
2024-11-27 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is showing strong recovery signs, nearing the $100K mark after a recent dip, supported by large market positions stabilizing the market. Ethereum is experiencing a surge in futures interest, indicating strong bullish momentum and increased market confidence. Solana is gaining traction with new highs and substantial DEX volume, surpassing Ethereum in this metric. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, with market cap growth driven by speculative interest. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although the focus is shifting due to evolving regulations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong recovery and bullish sentiment, with significant market support and on-chain activity suggesting further upside potential.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's increased futures interest and on-chain activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making it attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's new highs and impressive DEX volume signal robust market interest and potential for further gains, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin is testing resistance with growing market cap, suggesting potential for a breakout, but remains speculative.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish trends, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets."
2024-11-27 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark again, driven by renewed bullish sentiment and a massive position stabilizing the market after a recent sell-off. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels, indicating growing market confidence. Solana is also performing well, with new highs and substantial DEX volume surpassing Ethereum's, reflecting strong on-chain support. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, buoyed by market cap growth and speculation. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, but the focus is shifting due to regulatory changes in the EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with bullish news and technical indicators. The recent rebound and stabilization efforts suggest continued growth potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and record futures open interest indicate strong market confidence, making it an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong performance, new highs, and substantial DEX volume highlight its growth potential, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and positive sentiment from influential figures provide a moderate buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT remains a dominant stablecoin, the bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies suggests a neutral position as capital rotates into riskier assets."
2024-11-27 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a massive $15T position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to perform well, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level at $0.40, with market cap gains fueled by speculation and support from high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin is being retired.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and renewed bullish sentiment, coupled with significant market stabilization efforts, suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite testing resistance, Dogecoin's market cap gains and speculative interest provide a moderate bullish outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as capital rotates into riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a significant $15 trillion position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum with record futures open interest, indicating growing market confidence. Solana is also on an upward trajectory, hitting new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume, driven by memecoin trading. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, bolstered by market cap growth and speculation. Meanwhile, Tether continues to dominate the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with renewed bullish sentiment and significant market stabilization efforts, making it attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and surging activity indicate strong bullish momentum, justifying a positive allocation score.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's new highs and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight its strong market position and potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — While testing key resistance, Dogecoin's market cap growth and speculation provide a moderately positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the market showing bullish sentiment, there's no immediate need to allocate towards USDT, maintaining a neutral stance."
2024-11-27 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a significant $15T position stabilizing the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, evidenced by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues its upward trajectory, driven by high DEX volumes and a rally towards $300. Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels, with market cap gains fueled by speculation. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, although its euro stablecoin is being retired, indicating a strategic shift.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum with renewed investor confidence and significant market stabilization efforts. The positive news and technical indicators suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's record futures open interest and increased market confidence support a bullish outlook. The technical indicators are also favorable, indicating potential for continued gains.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's strong on-chain and derivatives data, along with high DEX volumes, suggest robust upward momentum. The asset is well-positioned to benefit from the current market conditions.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin is testing resistance levels, the mixed sentiment and lack of decisive technical signals warrant a neutral stance for now.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market shows bullish trends across major cryptocurrencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings, prompting a shift towards more volatile assets."
2024-11-27 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark again after a recent dip, supported by a massive $15 trillion position that stabilized the market. Ethereum is experiencing strong bullish momentum, with futures open interest hitting record levels and increased on-chain activity. Solana continues to rally, driven by strong on-chain support and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with its market cap boosted by speculation and media attention. Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin market, despite retiring its euro stablecoin, EURt.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with renewed market confidence and significant on-chain activity. The recent rebound and stabilization efforts suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's bullish momentum is supported by record futures open interest and increased on-chain activity, indicating strong market confidence and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong rally and surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume highlight its growing market presence and potential for continued price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin is testing a key resistance level, with market cap gains driven by speculation. While there is potential for a breakout, the risk of reversal remains.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the market showing bullish sentiment, maintaining a neutral position on USDT is prudent as capital rotates into riskier assets."
2024-11-27 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with strong upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has surged past $95K, driven by significant ETF inflows and institutional interest, although there is cautious sentiment due to the impending expiration of a large volume of options. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as it targets $4,000 and beyond. Solana is seeing increased institutional interest and ecosystem growth, highlighted by a recent ETF filing and a substantial rise in total value locked. Dogecoin has witnessed a dramatic increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

BTC: +0.8 — Strong ETF inflows and institutional interest are driving Bitcoin's price higher, supported by bullish technical indicators and increased on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further price gains, coupled with positive ETF inflows, make it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's ecosystem growth and institutional interest, as evidenced by the ETF filing and TVL increase, suggest a favorable environment for further price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.5 — The significant surge in trading volume and bullish price movement indicate strong investor interest and potential upside, warranting increased allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — In a bullish market environment, capital rotation away from stablecoins like USDT is expected as investors seek higher returns from riskier assets."
2024-11-28 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with strong institutional interest and ETF inflows driving significant price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K and Ethereum's break above $3,600 are supported by robust on-chain activity and technical indicators suggesting further gains. Solana is also experiencing positive momentum due to ecosystem growth and ETF-related news, while Dogecoin sees renewed investor interest with a substantial increase in trading volume. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with low volatility, which supports risk-on behavior in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and bullish momentum, along with positive ETF news, suggest further upside potential.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and positive technical indicators.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive ecosystem growth and ETF filing news indicate strong investor confidence and potential for price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant increase in trading volume and bullish sentiment suggest potential for further gains, despite low on-chain activity.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-11-28 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent price surge past $95K and Ethereum's break above $3,600 highlight the positive momentum, although caution is warranted due to the impending expiry of significant Bitcoin options. Solana is also experiencing heightened interest with a new ETF filing and significant ecosystem growth. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest. Despite these bullish trends, the macroeconomic environment remains stable, with relatively low volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could temper some of the crypto market exuberance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by ETF inflows and institutional interest, though caution is advised due to options expiry.

ETH: +0.7 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains with ETF inflows and positive technical indicators.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth are strong, supported by ETF filing and increased TVL.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant trading volume increase and optimistic price predictions suggest potential upside, but volatility remains high.

USDT: 0.0 — Neutral position as the market shows a preference for risk assets, but macroeconomic stability suggests keeping some exposure to stablecoins."
2024-11-28 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by significant ETF inflows and institutional interest. Bitcoin's recent surge past $95K, along with a substantial amount of options nearing expiry, suggests a potential for further volatility. Ethereum is also experiencing strong buying pressure, with technical indicators pointing towards potential gains. Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF filing indicate increasing institutional interest, while Dogecoin's trading volume surge reflects renewed investor enthusiasm. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and moderate interest rates, supporting a risk-on sentiment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could pose challenges for further upside in crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional inflows and ETF interest, coupled with bullish technical indicators, suggest further upside potential despite cautious sentiment around options expiry.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum and potential for a short squeeze, supported by ETF inflows and bullish technicals, indicate a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by the ETF filing and TVL increase, support a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant trading volume increase and optimistic price predictions suggest potential for further gains, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — Neutral stance as current market conditions favor risk assets, but maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent given potential market volatility."

2024-11-28 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving price increases for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, bolstered by ETF inflows, although the impending expiry of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum has broken the $3,600 mark, with analysts predicting further gains due to strong buying pressure. Solana is experiencing growing institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by a new ETF filing and a substantial increase in total value locked. Dogecoin has seen a significant increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest, while Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong price surge and ETF inflows indicate bullish sentiment, although the options expiry introduces some caution. The overall trend remains positive.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's price momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and bullish technical indicators, make it attractive for allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by the ETF filing and TVL increase, support a positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: +0.3 — The significant increase in trading volume and optimistic price predictions suggest potential upside, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the market showing a risk-on sentiment, there is no immediate need to hold USDT, but maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the market's cautious optimism."
2024-11-28 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K is supported by ETF inflows and institutional interest, although the upcoming expiration of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum also shows bullish momentum, with potential for further gains as it targets $4,000. Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF filing indicate increasing institutional interest, while Dogecoin's trading volume surge suggests renewed investor interest. Tether's expansion on the TON blockchain enhances its liquidity, although the discontinuation of EURT reflects regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional interest and ETF inflows are driving upward momentum, despite some caution around options expiry. The overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains as it targets higher price levels. Positive news and technical indicators support a favorable outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion are positive indicators, but recent price stability suggests a moderate allocation increase.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased trading volume and positive price predictions indicate potential upside, though current low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — As a stablecoin, USDT remains a neutral hold. While there's no current holding, its role as a safe haven in uncertain markets is acknowledged."
2024-11-28 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable yet cautious market with a relatively low volatility index (VIX) and a strong U.S. dollar index (DXY). Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, which has helped push their prices higher. Solana is seeing increased attention due to a new ETF filing and substantial growth in its ecosystem's total value locked (TVL). Dogecoin has witnessed a significant surge in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a focus on potential growth in major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong ETF inflows and institutional interest, combined with a recent price surge, suggest a bullish outlook. The upcoming options expiry may introduce some volatility, but the overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's price momentum and bullish news about potential price targets provide a strong buy signal. The ETF inflows further support its upward trajectory, making it an attractive asset.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF filing indicate increasing institutional interest, making it a promising asset. However, recent price volatility suggests a more cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent price fluctuations, the significant increase in trading volume and optimistic price predictions indicate potential upside. However, the lack of strong technical signals warrants a moderate score.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, USDT remains neutral. The capital rotation into riskier assets like BTC and ETH suggests no immediate need to increase exposure to stablecoins."
2024-11-28 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving positive momentum for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K and Ethereum's break above $3,600 are significant, supported by strong ETF inflows and bullish technical indicators. Solana is also seeing increased interest due to ETF filings and substantial growth in its ecosystem's total value locked. Dogecoin has experienced a notable increase in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest, though its price remains volatile. Meanwhile, Tether's focus on expanding USDT's reach on new blockchains indicates a strategic shift amidst regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong price movement and institutional interest, coupled with ETF inflows, suggest a favorable environment for further gains. However, caution is warranted due to the upcoming options expiry.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further price increases, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators, make it an attractive asset, though some caution is advised given the recent volatility.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF filing indicate positive sentiment, but recent price volatility suggests a moderate allocation increase is prudent.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite increased trading volume and optimistic price predictions, Dogecoin's speculative nature warrants a cautious approach, with a slight preference for capital allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macroeconomic environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate as risk appetite remains balanced."
2024-11-28 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a cautiously optimistic sentiment, with significant institutional interest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, as evidenced by ETF inflows. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, driven by strong institutional demand, although the impending expiry of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum has also shown strength, breaking through $3,600 with potential for further gains, supported by bullish technical indicators and analyst predictions. Solana is experiencing increased interest due to ETF filings and ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin is seeing renewed investor interest with a substantial increase in trading volume. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The strong institutional interest and ETF inflows provide a bullish backdrop, although the options expiry warrants some caution. Overall, Bitcoin remains attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further gains make it a favorable asset, supported by strong buying pressure and positive technical indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion are positive factors, although the lack of immediate buy signals in technical indicators suggests a moderate allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The surge in trading volume and positive price predictions indicate potential upside, but the lack of strong technical signals suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullishness, there is less need for stablecoin exposure, prompting a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2024-11-28 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum driven by ETF inflows and positive price movements. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K is supported by strong institutional interest, though the impending expiry of significant options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is similarly buoyed by ETF inflows and bullish technical indicators, suggesting potential for further gains. Solana is gaining attention due to a new ETF filing and substantial ecosystem growth, while Dogecoin sees renewed interest with a massive increase in trading volume. Tether's recent developments indicate strategic shifts in its offerings, including the discontinuation of EURT and expansion onto the TON blockchain.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent price surge and strong institutional interest provide a positive outlook, though cautious sentiment due to options expiry tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators, make it an attractive asset.

SOL: +0.3 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion are positive, but lack of immediate technical buy signals suggests a moderate allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased trading volume and renewed investor interest provide a slight positive bias, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving recent price movements in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $95K, supported by strong ETF inflows, although upcoming options expiries suggest some market caution. Ethereum has similarly broken through the $3,600 mark, with bullish sentiment and potential for further gains. Solana is experiencing growing institutional interest and ecosystem growth, as evidenced by a recent ETF filing and a significant increase in total value locked. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest, though its price has recently experienced a pullback. Tether remains a stable presence, with recent developments focused on expanding its reach and addressing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a lack of immediate technical buy signals, strong ETF inflows and institutional interest provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin, suggesting potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's recent price breakout and bullish news sentiment, coupled with potential for a short squeeze, make it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

SOL: +0.3 — Growing institutional interest and ecosystem expansion, as indicated by the ETF filing and TVL growth, support a modestly positive outlook for Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — While trading volume has surged, the recent price decline and lack of clear technical signals suggest a neutral stance is appropriate for now.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive sentiment and potential gains in other cryptocurrencies, it may be prudent to reduce stablecoin holdings slightly to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2024-11-28 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum due to ETF inflows, driving their prices upward. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K and Ethereum's break above $3,600 are notable, though the upcoming expiry of $13.6 billion in Bitcoin options suggests some market caution. Solana's ecosystem growth and ETF filing indicate increasing institutional confidence, while Dogecoin's trading volume surge reflects renewed investor interest. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, which may support continued risk-on sentiment. However, the U.S. dollar remains strong, which could temper some crypto gains.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the cautious sentiment around options expiry, strong ETF inflows and institutional interest provide a bullish backdrop, suggesting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — With bullish momentum and potential for further gains driven by ETF inflows and technical indicators, Ethereum deserves a higher allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — The positive news about its ecosystem growth and ETF filing supports a moderately bullish stance, though technical signals remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.3 — The significant increase in trading volume and optimistic price predictions suggest potential upside, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macroeconomic environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate as risk appetite remains steady."
2024-11-28 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-28 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant trading volume increase and positive price momentum suggest potential upside, though the asset remains speculative.

2024-11-28 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum due to ETF inflows and bullish price movements. Bitcoin's price surge past $95K is supported by strong institutional interest, although the upcoming expiry of a large volume of options indicates some market caution. Ethereum is also experiencing bullish momentum, with predictions of further price increases. Solana is gaining attention from institutional investors with the filing of a Solana-focused ETF and a notable increase in its ecosystem's total value locked. Dogecoin is seeing a resurgence in trading volume and price, driven by renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the cautious sentiment due to options expiry, the strong ETF inflows and institutional interest suggest a positive outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and strong buying pressure, make Ethereum attractive.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth provide a positive backdrop, though the technical indicators remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.2 — Increased trading volume and positive price predictions indicate potential upside, though it's still speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent."
2024-11-28 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable institutional interest and ETF inflows driving bullish momentum in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's recent price surge past $95K is supported by significant ETF inflows, although the impending expiry of $13.6 billion in options suggests some market caution. Ethereum has broken the $3,600 mark with potential to reach $4,500, driven by strong buying pressure and ETF inflows. Solana is experiencing ecosystem growth, highlighted by a 48% increase in total value locked and a new ETF filing, indicating growing institutional interest. Dogecoin has seen a dramatic increase in trading volume and price, suggesting renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether's expansion onto the TON blockchain could enhance liquidity, despite the discontinuation of its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Strong ETF inflows and institutional interest are driving bullish sentiment, though caution is warranted due to the upcoming options expiry.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive momentum with potential for further gains, supported by ETF inflows and bullish technical indicators suggesting a possible short squeeze.

SOL: +0.4 — Institutional interest and ecosystem growth are positive indicators, though the technical signals remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.3 — Significant increase in trading volume and positive price momentum suggest potential upside, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — While there is no current holding, the market conditions do not strongly favor a move into or out of stablecoins at this time."
2024-11-28 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge, driven by ETF inflows and strong institutional interest, although the impending expiry of a large volume of options suggests some market caution. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum, with analysts predicting further price increases. Solana is gaining attention due to a new ETF filing and substantial growth in its ecosystem's total value locked, indicating strong investor confidence. Dogecoin has seen a remarkable increase in trading volume and price, reflecting renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its reach by launching USDT on the TON blockchain, despite discontinuing its EURT stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's price surge and strong institutional interest are positive signals, though the options expiry introduces some caution. Overall, the asset remains attractive.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and potential for further gains make it appealing, supported by ETF inflows and positive technical indicators.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's ecosystem growth and the new ETF filing highlight strong institutional interest, making it a highly attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — The significant increase in trading volume and price suggests renewed investor interest, though the speculative nature warrants a moderate allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, USDT remains a neutral asset as market conditions favor risk-taking over stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-28 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by significant price increases and institutional interest. Bitcoin's price is nearing the $100K mark, bolstered by strong mining activity, while Ethereum has experienced substantial ETF inflows, indicating growing institutional confidence. Solana is seeing increased trading activity, particularly in the DeFi space, which has surpassed Ethereum's DEX volume. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, although its recent momentum has slightly cooled. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, despite some negative news regarding its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price performance and institutional mining activity suggest continued upward momentum. The nearing of the $100K mark is a significant psychological level that could attract further buying interest.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate positive sentiment, although some caution is warranted due to mixed signals from its founder.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's resumption of trading on Bitstamp and impressive DeFi activity provide a bullish outlook, with potential for further gains as trading volumes increase.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite a recent rally, Dogecoin's momentum has slightly cooled. However, ongoing discussions involving high-profile figures like Musk could reignite interest.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether remains in demand, its role in illicit activities and the current market's risk-on sentiment suggest a neutral position, maintaining flexibility for potential capital rotation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing a significant milestone of $100K, supported by strong institutional mining activity. Ethereum is experiencing substantial inflows into ETFs, although recent price movements suggest some caution. Solana is seeing increased activity, particularly in DeFi, with Bitstamp resuming trading in the U.S., which could further boost its appeal. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although its involvement in illicit activities could pose risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum, nearing a significant psychological level of $100K, supported by institutional interest and positive market sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent caution, the substantial inflows into Ethereum ETFs and its recent price highs suggest a moderate buy signal, though tempered by mixed signals from its founder.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and the resumption of U.S. trading on Bitstamp provide a bullish outlook, supported by positive momentum indicators.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of strong technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a cautious approach, despite potential regulatory discussions.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the stablecoin's involvement in illicit activities, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent as the market's risk appetite remains balanced."
2024-11-29 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with notable upward momentum across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant rally, nearing $100K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although mixed signals from its founder have introduced some caution. Solana has benefited from increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on Bitstamp, while Dogecoin has surged significantly, partly due to anticipated discussions involving Elon Musk. Despite these bullish trends, Tether remains stable, with recent minting activity reflecting ongoing demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with bullish news and technical indicators, suggesting further potential gains.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed founder signals, strong ETF inflows and a recent price increase indicate positive sentiment and potential for growth.

SOL: +0.7 — Solana's increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on Bitstamp provide a strong bullish case, supported by technical momentum.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of strong technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall bullish market sentiment, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT and into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has experienced a substantial monthly gain and is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen record ETF inflows, although it faces mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest in the U.S., while Dogecoin has surged significantly, buoyed by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum with significant price gains and positive news on institutional mining. The market sentiment is supportive, pushing BTC towards $100K.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed signals from founders, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive momentum is supported by increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest, indicating a strong potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's massive rally and potential regulatory discussions with influential figures like Musk suggest continued positive sentiment and potential upside.

USDT: 0.0 — While demand for USDT remains high, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests a neutral stance as capital rotates into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a strong rally, nearing $98K, and is supported by positive news such as institutional mining activity. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founder.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong price momentum and positive news flow, including institutional mining activity and nearing a key psychological price level, make it an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some caution from founder signals, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on major platforms support its bullish momentum, making it a favorable asset for allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has surged significantly, the lack of substantial on-chain activity and reliance on speculative news warrant a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the bullish sentiment across cryptocurrencies, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as capital rotation into riskier assets is likely."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant gains in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin over the past month. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, buoyed by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although recent mixed signals from its founders have introduced some caution. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading volume, especially in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in DEX activity. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although it faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, nearing a significant psychological level of $100K, combined with positive mining activity, suggests a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed signals, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate a moderate buy, albeit with some caution due to potential pullbacks.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and the resumption of U.S. trading on Bitstamp provide a bullish outlook, supporting a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the low on-chain activity suggests a more cautious approach, warranting a slight buy signal.

USDT: -0.2 — With the current bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is less incentive to hold stablecoins, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure if held."
2024-11-29 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and showing strong upward momentum, driven by significant institutional mining activity and positive price action. Ethereum is experiencing substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on Bitstamp, contributing to its positive outlook. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, driven by broader crypto gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities may weigh on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with significant price gains and positive news on institutional mining. The market sentiment is highly supportive, suggesting further upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite a recent pullback, Ethereum's strong ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate a positive outlook. However, mixed signals from founders suggest some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's strong DeFi activity and resumed U.S. trading on Bitstamp are driving positive momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's recent rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop, although low on-chain activity suggests a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether remains in demand, concerns about its use in illicit activities and the overall bullish market sentiment suggest maintaining a neutral stance to allow for capital rotation into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and experiencing significant monthly gains. Ethereum has seen substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong institutional interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana's DeFi activity is robust, with trading volumes surpassing Ethereum, and recent news of Bitstamp re-enabling SOL trading in the U.S. has further boosted its price. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although recent news highlights its use in illicit activities, which could raise regulatory concerns.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with bullish sentiment and institutional mining activity, suggesting continued price appreciation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent pullbacks, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate potential for further growth, albeit with some caution.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in trading activity and DeFi volumes, along with renewed U.S. trading, support a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant recent gains and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop, though the low on-chain activity warrants some caution.

USDT: 0.0 — While demand for USDT remains high, the overall bullish market sentiment suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-29 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and Ethereum ETFs experiencing significant inflows, indicating strong institutional interest. Bitcoin's recent performance marks one of its best monthly gains since 2021, and Solana is seeing increased activity with Bitstamp re-enabling trading and DeFi volumes surpassing Ethereum.

Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although recent news highlights its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with significant price gains and positive news regarding institutional mining activity. The bullish sentiment and nearing of the $100K mark make it a favorable asset for allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from founders, Ethereum's record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook. The asset remains attractive, though slightly less so than Bitcoin.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and resumed trading on Bitstamp, indicating strong demand and potential for further price appreciation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's massive rally and potential regulatory discussions add to its appeal, though the asset's speculative nature warrants a more cautious approach compared to others.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a reduced need for stablecoin holdings. Capital is likely to rotate into more volatile assets to capitalize on the current market momentum."

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant price increases and positive news across several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing a milestone of $100K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and a notable monthly gain. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating rising investor interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana benefits from renewed trading activity in the U.S. and impressive DeFi volume, surpassing Ethereum. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, supported by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving influential figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, though recent news highlights its involvement in illicit activities, which could pose regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum with significant institutional interest and a near-record monthly gain, suggesting further upside potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent pullbacks, the substantial ETF inflows and recent highs indicate a positive outlook, though tempered by mixed signals from the founder.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in trading activity and DeFi volume, along with a bullish technical setup, make Solana attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Dogecoin's recent rally and high-profile discussions provide a bullish backdrop, although the lack of significant on-chain activity warrants a moderate score.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT remains a stable option, the current bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining a neutral stance, especially given the regulatory concerns highlighted in recent news."
2024-11-29 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has shown strong performance, nearing $98K, driven by positive market sentiment and institutional mining activity. Ethereum has experienced substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although technical signals remain mixed. Solana has benefited from increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp, boosting its price. Dogecoin has seen a remarkable rally, partly fueled by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving influential figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although its involvement in illicit activities poses a risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news on institutional mining and price performance support a bullish outlook. The asset is nearing a significant psychological level, which could further drive interest.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite mixed technical signals, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest underlying strength. However, caution is warranted due to potential pullbacks.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading on Bitstamp provide strong support. The asset's technical indicators are also favorable.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price rally and upcoming discussions involving high-profile figures create a bullish environment. However, low on-chain activity suggests some caution.

USDT: 0.0 — While demand remains high, the overall bullish market sentiment reduces the relative attractiveness of holding stablecoins. However, given the current portfolio status, no reduction is possible."
2024-11-29 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into its ETFs, although there are mixed signals from its founders. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi activity is outperforming Ethereum. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, partly fueled by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, although it faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong upward momentum with bullish technical indicators and positive news. The nearing of the $100K mark and strong institutional mining activity further support a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a moderate buy signal. However, caution is warranted due to mixed sentiment from its founders.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's positive technical indicators, along with increased trading activity and DeFi volume, indicate a strong buy signal. The resumption of trading in the U.S. adds further support.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite a recent slight price decrease, Dogecoin's overall rally and potential regulatory discussions suggest a cautious buy signal. However, the low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the market's bullish sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent. The demand for USDT remains high, but the focus is on riskier assets."
2024-11-29 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the DeFi space, with Bitstamp resuming trading in the U.S. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, fueled by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, despite concerns over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and nearing of the $100K mark, coupled with positive news on institutional mining, make it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals from founders, the record inflows into Ethereum ETFs and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — The resumption of trading on Bitstamp and significant DeFi activity provide a strong bullish case for Solana, justifying an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's substantial rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive backdrop, though the asset remains speculative, suggesting a cautious increase.

USDT: 0.0 — While USDT demand remains high, the broader bullish market sentiment suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation to stablecoins."
2024-11-29 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with significant price increases and positive developments across multiple cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and a substantial monthly gain. Ethereum has seen record ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although there are mixed signals from its founders. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the U.S., and its DeFi volume has surpassed Ethereum's. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, partly fueled by discussions involving high-profile figures like Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, both in price and on-chain activity, coupled with positive news about institutional mining, supports a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some mixed signals, Ethereum's record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a favorable outlook, warranting a moderately positive allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's re-enabled trading in the U.S. and strong DeFi activity provide a solid foundation for continued growth, justifying a positive score.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the potential for volatility and speculative nature suggests a cautious but positive stance.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the overall bullish market conditions, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as capital may rotate into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a substantial rally, nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has also seen impressive gains, supported by record ETF inflows, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founder. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp in the U.S., leading to a surge in its price. Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, largely driven by broader market gains and potential discussions with lawmakers. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, evidenced by significant minting activity, despite some negative news regarding its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news sentiment, with Bitcoin nearing $100K and significant institutional mining activity, make it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive ETF inflows and recent price highs support a bullish outlook, although some caution is warranted due to mixed founder signals.

SOL: +0.6 — Increased DeFi activity and the resumption of U.S. trading on Bitstamp provide strong support for Solana, indicating potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite a significant rally, the potential for further discussions with lawmakers and continued market interest suggest moderate upside potential.

USDT: 0.0 — While there is high demand for Tether, the overall bullish sentiment in the market reduces the need for stablecoin exposure at this time."
2024-11-29 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, marking its fourth-best monthly gain since 2021, driven by strong institutional mining activity. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into its ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana has experienced a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin has also seen a massive rally, driven by broader market gains and upcoming discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, with significant minting activity, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and institutional interest, with positive news and on-chain activity supporting further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Despite a slight pullback, Ethereum's strong ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest continued investor confidence.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's increased trading activity and positive news from Bitstamp contribute to a favorable outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, its recent price stabilization and upcoming discussions provide a moderate bullish signal.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the bullish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as capital may rotate into riskier assets."
2024-11-29 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a strong rally, nearing the $100K mark, driven by positive sentiment and institutional mining activity. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price pullbacks suggest some caution. Solana is benefiting from renewed trading activity and impressive DeFi volume, highlighting its growing ecosystem. Dogecoin has surged dramatically, reflecting broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, though concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by positive news and on-chain activity. The approach towards $100K and institutional interest make it a favorable asset for allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price pullbacks, the record ETF inflows and high investor interest provide a positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to mixed signals from founders.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's resurgence in trading activity and impressive DeFi volume make it an attractive asset. The resumption of trading on major platforms further supports its bullish trend.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's significant rally and potential regulatory discussions provide a positive sentiment, but the lack of substantial on-chain activity suggests a more cautious approach.

USDT: 0.0 — While demand for USDT remains high, its role as a stablecoin in a bullish market environment suggests a neutral stance, maintaining flexibility for capital allocation into more volatile assets."
2024-11-29 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable surge, nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has also seen substantial inflows into its ETFs, indicating growing investor interest, although some caution is advised due to mixed signals from its founders. Solana is benefiting from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading opportunities in the U.S., while Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, partly fueled by speculative interest and potential regulatory discussions. Meanwhile, Tether continues to play a crucial role in liquidity provision, despite some negative news regarding its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum with significant price gains and institutional support, making it a prime candidate for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest positive sentiment, though mixed founder signals warrant a moderate approach.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's increased DeFi activity and renewed trading support in the U.S. position it well for further gains, justifying a positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent gains, Dogecoin's speculative nature and low on-chain activity suggest a cautious but positive stance.

USDT: 0.0 — While Tether remains a stable liquidity option, the current bullish market environment reduces the need for stablecoin holdings, suggesting a neutral position."
2024-11-29 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating growing investor interest, although there is some caution due to mixed signals from its founder. Solana is experiencing a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the DeFi space, which has surpassed Ethereum's DEX volume. Dogecoin has rallied significantly, buoyed by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Tether remains stable but has been involved in controversial activities, highlighting its dual role in both legitimate and illicit financial activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with significant price gains and increased on-chain activity. Positive news about institutional mining further supports its upward trajectory.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite some cautionary signals, Ethereum's ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook. The market remains supportive, albeit with some volatility.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's trading activity and DeFi volume are strong, supported by positive developments like the resumption of trading on Bitstamp. This indicates a favorable environment for growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Dogecoin's significant rally and potential regulatory discussions add to its appeal, although its speculative nature warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT remains stable, the broader market's bullish sentiment suggests a slight rotation out of stablecoins into more volatile assets. However, its role in illicit activities is a concern."
2024-11-29 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K milestone, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has experienced substantial inflows into its ETFs, indicating growing investor interest, although mixed signals from its founder have introduced some caution. Solana has benefited from increased DeFi activity and renewed trading interest, while Dogecoin has seen a massive rally, fueled by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions. Despite the bullish environment, Tether continues to play a crucial role in liquidity, with recent minting activities highlighting its demand, although concerns about its use in illicit activities persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish sentiment and institutional support, with Bitcoin nearing a significant psychological level of $100K. Positive on-chain activity further supports the upward trend.

ETH: +0.5 — While there are mixed signals from the founder, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest continued investor interest and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive developments in DeFi activity and renewed trading interest in the U.S. market provide a strong foundation for growth, supported by technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite recent gains, the potential for regulatory discussions and high volatility warrant a cautious approach, though the overall sentiment remains positive.

USDT: 0.0 — While there is demand for liquidity, the bullish sentiment across other assets suggests maintaining current exposure without increasing stablecoin holdings."
2024-11-29 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-29 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains observed across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin is nearing a milestone of $100K, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive sentiment. Ethereum has experienced substantial ETF inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although there are mixed signals from its founders. Solana has seen a resurgence in trading activity, especially in the U.S., and its DeFi ecosystem is thriving, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin has experienced a massive rally, partly fueled by high-profile discussions involving Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Tether continues to see high demand, with significant minting activity, although it faces scrutiny due to its involvement in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, nearing $100K, and positive institutional mining news suggest continued bullishness. The technical indicators support this view.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed founder signals, the record ETF inflows and recent price highs indicate strong investor interest and potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.6 — The resumption of trading in the U.S. and impressive DeFi activity provide a strong foundation for growth, supported by positive technical signals.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the low on-chain activity and recent price pullback suggest a more cautious approach, though discussions involving Musk could provide further upside.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the bullish market conditions, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as it serves as a safe haven during volatility but lacks growth potential in a rising market."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant gains across major cryptocurrencies in November. Bitcoin is nearing the $100K mark, driven by strong institutional mining activity and positive market sentiment. Ethereum has seen substantial inflows into ETFs, indicating strong investor interest, although mixed signals from its founder have introduced some caution. Solana has experienced a resurgence in trading activity, particularly in the DeFi space, surpassing Ethereum in DEX volume. Dogecoin has also seen a massive rally, fueled by broader market gains and potential regulatory discussions involving high-profile figures. Meanwhile, Tether has been actively minting new USDT to meet demand, although it faces scrutiny over its use in illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum and nearing of the $100K mark, coupled with positive institutional mining news, make it highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed signals, the significant ETF inflows and recent price highs suggest a positive outlook, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's impressive DEX volume and the resumption of trading on Bitstamp highlight its growing DeFi presence, making it a favorable asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has rallied significantly, the lack of strong technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.2 — With the bullish sentiment across the market, there is less need to hold stablecoins, though some exposure is prudent given potential volatility."
2024-11-30 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has decreased as investors shift towards altcoins. Ethereum is focusing on scalability improvements, while Solana is experiencing a price correction amidst an overall bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to expand, led by USDT, which remains a key player in DeFi and trading activities. Despite these developments, macroeconomic indicators such as a high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices suggest a mixed environment, potentially limiting aggressive risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K are positive, but reduced dominance suggests a cautious approach. Maintain moderate exposure to capture potential gains while being mindful of altcoin strength.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's focus on scalability and recent legal developments are favorable, but technical indicators remain neutral. Slightly increase exposure to leverage potential upside from network improvements.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent price correction, Solana's long-term outlook remains bullish. Maintain a modest allocation to benefit from potential recovery and future growth.

DOGE: +0.1 — Dogecoin's consolidation and potential for a breakout warrant a small increase in exposure, but maintain caution given recent volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintain a neutral stance on USDT. While stablecoin demand is high, the current market environment favors slight risk exposure over holding stable assets."
2024-11-30 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is decreasing as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is focusing on scalability improvements, and Solana is experiencing a slight pullback but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to expand, led by USDT, which remains a key player in DeFi and trading activities. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with low volatility, which could support continued interest in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued interest. However, the lack of bullish momentum signals warrants a moderate score.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's focus on scalability and recent legal developments are positive, but technical indicators are mixed, suggesting a cautious buy.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's overall bullish trend and positive AI forecasts indicate strong potential, despite recent price corrections.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout support a modest positive outlook, but recent price decreases suggest caution.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stablecoin demand remaining strong, maintaining a neutral position is prudent as capital rotates into riskier assets."
2024-11-30 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing signs of strength with technical upgrades and legal clarity around Tornado Cash, while Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing consolidation phases with potential for upward momentum. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady indices, suggesting a balanced risk appetite. Stablecoins like USDT continue to see demand, particularly in the DeFi space, but the broader market is leaning towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight pullback, Bitcoin's recent rally and strong market sentiment indicate continued potential for growth. However, its dominance is decreasing, suggesting a balanced approach.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and bullish momentum signal strong potential for further gains, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's price correction and consolidation suggest a cautious but positive outlook, supported by long-term bullish forecasts.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout make it moderately attractive, especially with historical uptrend support.

USDT: 0.0 — While stablecoins remain in demand, the current market environment favors riskier assets, suggesting a neutral stance on USDT."
2024-11-30 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum shows bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, while Solana is experiencing consolidation but maintains a positive long-term outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market is expanding, with Tether leading the charge, reflecting strong demand in the DeFi space. The macroeconomic context remains stable, with low volatility and supportive conditions for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to the $100K mark indicate continued upward potential. However, the absence of a strong buy signal in recent technicals suggests a moderate allocation increase.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical upgrades, coupled with favorable legal news, make it highly attractive. The potential breakout above the upper Bollinger Band supports a strong buy signal.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's consolidation phase and positive long-term forecasts suggest a cautious increase in exposure. The lack of immediate bullish signals tempers enthusiasm, but the overall trend remains positive.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a slight increase in allocation. The recent rally and analyst predictions support this view.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent. The focus remains on risk assets as market sentiment is cautiously optimistic."
2024-11-30 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is generally bullish, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has slightly decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing strong technical indicators and bullish momentum, supported by recent upgrades and favorable court rulings. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains an overall bullish trend with positive forecasts. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, reflecting ongoing demand in DeFi and trading.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued upward potential. However, caution is warranted due to the shift towards altcoins.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's strong technical indicators, combined with positive news on scalability upgrades and legal clarity, support a bullish stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Although currently consolidating, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts justify a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for further gains suggest a cautious positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent given the bullish sentiment across other assets."
2024-11-30 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, though its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with technical upgrades and legal clarifications, while Solana is consolidating after a brief dip, with predictions of continued upward movement. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical patterns. The stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether leading the charge, indicating strong demand for liquidity and stability in the crypto space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent rally and high transaction activity, BTC's dominance is decreasing, suggesting a shift towards altcoins. However, the overall bullish sentiment supports a moderate positive allocation.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news regarding scalability improvements and legal clarity provide a compelling case for increased allocation to ETH.

SOL: +0.2 — Although SOL is consolidating, the overall bullish trend and positive price predictions justify a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — DOGE's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for significant gains based on historical trends suggest a moderate positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the stablecoin market expanding, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as risk appetite in the market remains relatively high."
2024-11-30 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has decreased as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum shows bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, while Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing consolidation phases with potential for future gains. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced approach, with a slight preference for risk assets over stablecoins. The stablecoin market continues to expand, led by USDT, indicating ongoing demand for liquidity and stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and proximity to $100K suggest continued interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news regarding scalability improvements and legal clarity support a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — While experiencing a brief dip, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future forecasts justify a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for significant upside based on historical trends warrant a cautious buy signal.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate, as it serves primarily as a liquidity buffer."
2024-11-30 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally, although its dominance is waning as investors shift towards altcoins. Ethereum is showing bullish signals with technical upgrades and legal developments, while Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase despite a generally positive outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical patterns. The stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether leading the charge, indicating robust demand in the DeFi space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent rally, BTC's dominance is decreasing, suggesting a shift towards altcoins. However, the strong November performance supports a modest positive allocation.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news regarding scalability improvements suggest continued upward momentum, making ETH an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — While experiencing a slight pullback, SOL's overall trend remains bullish with positive future forecasts, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation after a significant rally and potential for further gains based on historical trends justify a slight positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and stablecoin demand remaining high, maintain a neutral stance as there is no immediate need to increase exposure."
2024-11-30 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance is waning as capital flows into altcoins. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with technical upgrades and favorable legal news, while Solana maintains a positive outlook despite a recent price pullback. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a supportive backdrop for risk assets. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains high, which could exert pressure on crypto prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of short-term technical buy signals, Bitcoin's strong rally and increased on-chain activity suggest a stable position with potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and scalability improvements provide a strong case for increased allocation, supported by favorable news and technical indicators.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts justify a moderate buy signal, despite recent price consolidation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is consolidating, its historical uptrend potential and analyst optimism support a cautious increase in allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent, as risk appetite remains steady."
2024-11-30 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's market dominance is declining as investors shift focus toward altcoins, suggesting the potential onset of an ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing positive technical indicators and benefits from recent upgrades aimed at improving scalability. Solana is experiencing consolidation after a recent dip, but forecasts remain bullish. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with analysts predicting further gains. The stablecoin market continues to expand, led by Tether, which remains a key player in meeting DeFi and trading demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a strong rally, Bitcoin's declining dominance suggests a shift toward altcoins. However, its recent price performance and activity surge warrant a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum and benefits from recent scalability upgrades, making it an attractive asset in the current market environment.

SOL: +0.4 — While experiencing a recent dip, Solana's overall trend remains bullish, supported by positive forecasts and technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin is consolidating within a bullish pattern, with potential for further gains as indicated by analyst predictions.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the stablecoin market expanding, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as capital rotation into riskier assets continues."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin's recent rally has seen it approach the $100K mark, although its dominance has decreased, indicating a shift towards altcoins. Ethereum continues to show strength with bullish technical indicators and positive news regarding scalability improvements. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but remains in a bullish trend, while Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Tether's expansion reflects ongoing demand in the DeFi space, but the stablecoin market remains a safe haven for capital preservation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent rally, Bitcoin's technical indicators are not strongly bullish, and its market dominance is decreasing. However, the overall positive sentiment and high transaction activity support a modest positive allocation.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news about scalability improvements suggest Ethereum is well-positioned for further gains. Its current market environment supports a higher allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's consolidation phase and bullish trend, combined with positive price forecasts, make it an attractive option for capital allocation, albeit with some caution due to recent volatility.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin is consolidating, the potential for a breakout and historical uptrend support a slight positive allocation, though its low on-chain activity tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is warranted, though maintaining some exposure for liquidity purposes is prudent."
2024-11-30 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is decreasing as investors shift focus towards altcoins. Ethereum's technical upgrades and legal developments are providing a supportive backdrop, while Solana shows signs of consolidation with potential for future gains. Dogecoin is stabilizing after a significant rally, with analysts predicting further upside. The stablecoin market continues to expand, led by Tether, reflecting ongoing demand in DeFi and trading activities. Despite these positive developments, macroeconomic indicators such as high Treasury yields and a strong U.S. dollar suggest a mixed environment, potentially limiting aggressive risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in price and no strong technical buy signals, Bitcoin's recent rally and high transaction activity suggest continued interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong technical indicators and positive news around scalability improvements support a bullish outlook, making Ethereum an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts warrant a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, the lack of strong technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance for now.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation into altcoins, maintaining a lower allocation in stablecoins like USDT is advisable."
2024-11-30 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has decreased as investors shift towards altcoins. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum with its recent scalability upgrade, while Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase after a brief dip. Dogecoin is consolidating within a bullish pattern, suggesting potential for a breakout. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar index, which may influence crypto market dynamics. Stablecoins, particularly USDT, continue to dominate the market, reflecting ongoing demand in DeFi and trading.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent rally, Bitcoin's dominance is waning, suggesting a shift to altcoins. However, strong on-chain activity and positive news support a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical indicators and recent upgrade news are bullish, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Although Solana is consolidating, the overall bullish trend and positive future price predictions warrant a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin is consolidating within a bullish pattern, the lack of immediate technical signals keeps the allocation neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards altcoins, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-11-30 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November. However, Bitcoin's market dominance is decreasing, indicating a shift towards altcoins, which could signal an upcoming ""altseason."" Ethereum is showing resilience with its recent upgrades aimed at improving scalability, while Solana's price correction suggests consolidation within a broader bullish trend. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether leading in market share, reflecting ongoing demand in DeFi and trading activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a recent rally, Bitcoin's dominance is waning, suggesting a shift towards altcoins. However, strong market sentiment and on-chain activity support a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and positive sentiment around scalability improvements provide a strong case for increased allocation, despite mixed short-term technical signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's recent price correction and consolidation within a bullish trend, along with positive long-term forecasts, justify a cautious increase in exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation and potential for a breakout, supported by historical uptrend analysis, warrant a slight increase in allocation, though caution is advised due to its volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stablecoin market that remains robust, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent to allow for flexibility in reallocating capital towards more volatile assets."
2024-11-30 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong November rally, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is experiencing positive developments with its Pectra upgrade, enhancing scalability, while Solana shows signs of consolidation but maintains a bullish outlook. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet DeFi and trading demand, reflecting a robust stablecoin market. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a drop in market dominance, Bitcoin's strong November rally and proximity to the $100K mark indicate positive momentum. However, caution is warranted due to the shift toward altcoins.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and legal clarity on Tornado Cash provide a supportive backdrop, coupled with a consistent buy signal from technical indicators.

SOL: +0.3 — While experiencing a slight pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive long-term forecasts suggest potential for growth, albeit with some consolidation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a modest positive allocation, though recent volatility should be considered.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the current market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as there is no immediate need for increased stablecoin exposure amidst a balanced risk appetite."
2024-11-30 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark following a strong rally in November. However, its market dominance has decreased, indicating a shift towards altcoins, suggesting a potential altseason. Ethereum is experiencing positive developments with scalability improvements, while Solana shows signs of bullish momentum despite a recent price pullback. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by Tether, continues to expand, reflecting sustained demand in DeFi and trading activities. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with low volatility and no significant disruptions from traditional markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish momentum suggest continued upward potential, warranting increased exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Positive technical signals and favorable news regarding scalability improvements make Ethereum an attractive asset for allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — While technical indicators are neutral, positive news forecasts and overall bullish sentiment provide a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a slight increase in allocation, though caution is advised due to recent volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent as market conditions do not strongly favor stablecoins at this time."
2024-11-30 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

2024-11-30 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing positive developments with upgrades aimed at scalability, while Solana is consolidating after a brief dip, with predictions of further gains. Dogecoin is in a consolidation phase after a significant rally, with potential for further upside. The stablecoin market continues to expand, with Tether leading the charge, indicating strong demand in DeFi and trading activities. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with low volatility, which could support continued risk-taking in crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent rally and bullish momentum, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment for further gains, despite a slight decrease in market dominance.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, and the recent upgrade news supports a bullish outlook, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite a recent dip, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future predictions provide a moderate buy signal, though current technicals are neutral.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a cautious positive allocation, though technicals remain mixed.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable market environment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as there is no immediate need for increased stablecoin exposure."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance is decreasing as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing signs of scalability improvements and legal clarity, which could bolster confidence. Solana is experiencing a consolidation phase but maintains a bullish outlook, while Dogecoin is stabilizing after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. The stablecoin market, led by USDT, continues to expand, reflecting ongoing demand in DeFi and trading activities. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced risk approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish momentum signal a continued positive outlook, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's technical and legal advancements, coupled with bullish momentum, suggest a favorable environment for further gains.

SOL: +0.3 — While experiencing a temporary pullback, Solana's overall bullish trend and positive future forecasts support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's consolidation within a bullish pattern and potential for a breakout justify a cautious increase in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent, as capital rotation into riskier assets is more appealing in the current market environment."
2024-11-30 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, though its dominance is waning as altcoins gain traction. Ethereum is showing signs of scalability improvements, which could bolster its long-term appeal. Solana is experiencing a price correction but maintains a bullish outlook, supported by positive forecasts. Dogecoin is consolidating after a significant rally, with potential for further gains. Meanwhile, USDT continues to expand its market presence, reflecting strong demand in the DeFi space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's strong rally and bullish momentum signals suggest continued upward potential. Current holdings are minimal, so increasing exposure is favorable.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's scalability improvements and strong technical indicators support a positive outlook. Current holdings are substantial, but further allocation could capitalize on its bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.3 — Although experiencing a price pullback, Solana's long-term bullish trend and positive AI forecasts justify a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin is consolidating within a range, with no clear immediate direction. Holding current positions is prudent until a breakout is confirmed.

USDT: -0.2 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly is advisable, though maintaining some liquidity is prudent given market volatility."
2024-11-30 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin nearing the $100K mark after a strong rally in November, although its dominance has slightly decreased as investors show interest in altcoins. Ethereum is undergoing technical upgrades to improve scalability, which could bolster its long-term appeal. Solana is experiencing a market pullback but remains in a bullish trend, with forecasts predicting further price increases. Dogecoin has consolidated after a significant rally, with potential for further gains based on historical patterns. Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its supply to meet growing demand in the DeFi space, highlighting its role as a stablecoin leader.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite a slight decrease in dominance, Bitcoin's recent strong rally and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward potential. However, caution is warranted due to the shift towards altcoins.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's technical upgrades and bullish momentum signal a positive outlook, though recent price decreases suggest a need for cautious optimism.

SOL: +0.2 — While currently experiencing a pullback, Solana's long-term bullish trend and positive forecasts support a modest allocation increase.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite consolidation and potential for future gains, current technical indicators do not provide a strong buy signal, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.2 — With the market showing signs of risk appetite, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to reallocate capital towards more volatile assets."
2024-12-01 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment suggests a relatively stable outlook with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4, and a strong S&P 500 index. However, the high U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) at 106.21 could imply a strong dollar environment, which might pressure crypto assets. Bitcoin shows mixed signals with bullish momentum but low on-chain activity, and the news of increased institutional involvement introduces both opportunities and risks. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, but lacks significant news catalysts. Solana continues to show weak technical signals, while Dogecoin has seen a recent price increase but lacks strong momentum. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating shifting dynamics in stablecoin demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite low on-chain activity, Bitcoin's bullish technical indicators and institutional interest provide a moderate positive outlook. However, the potential risks from increased institutional involvement warrant caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's consistent bullish technical indicators and stable on-chain activity suggest a favorable environment for maintaining or slightly increasing exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana shows no strong technical signals or news catalysts, suggesting a neutral stance is appropriate given its current market position.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin experienced a recent price increase, the lack of significant momentum signals and news suggests maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.2 — With the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets due to the overall bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4, and a relatively strong U.S. Dollar Index at 106.21. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing institutional interest but facing potential risks due to rapid price appreciation. Ethereum maintains a steady upward trend, supported by bullish momentum indicators. Solana and Dogecoin exhibit no significant news-driven catalysts, and both show technical weakness. Tether remains stable, although its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating a shift in capital preferences. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a preference for risk assets over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the risks associated with increased institutional involvement, the technical signals remain relatively stable, suggesting a cautious buy.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and technical indicators support a moderate increase in exposure, as no negative news impacts sentiment.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of positive technical signals and news suggests holding the current position without further allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — With no significant news and technical weakness, reducing exposure slightly is prudent given the recent price volatility.

USDT: -0.3 — As the market shows a modest risk-on sentiment, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets is appropriate."
2024-12-01 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin's recent price decline and increased institutional interest introduce new risks, suggesting potential volatility. Ethereum shows mixed signals with a lack of significant news, while Solana and Dogecoin also lack strong directional indicators. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a neutral to slightly risk-off environment. Tether remains stable, but the news of XRP surpassing its market cap may influence perceptions of stability and liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and concerns about institutional risks suggest caution. The lack of bullish momentum and potential volatility warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite the recent price decrease, Ethereum maintains a buy signal on trend indicators. The lack of significant news keeps sentiment neutral, but technicals support a modest positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's technical indicators are neutral, with no significant news to drive sentiment. The slight price decrease and lack of bullish momentum suggest holding current positions.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price volatility and lack of bullish signals suggest a cautious approach. Low on-chain activity and no significant news further support a neutral to slightly negative stance.

USDT: +0.3 — In a cautious market environment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent. The recent news about XRP may impact sentiment, but USDT remains a safe haven for capital preservation."
2024-12-01 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The U.S. Dollar Index is moderately high, which can exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin shows mixed signals with increased institutional interest, but this also introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana exhibit neutral technical indicators with no significant news to drive price action. Dogecoin has shown some recent price volatility but lacks strong directional signals. Tether remains stable, though its market cap was recently surpassed by XRP, which may affect its perceived stability among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite institutional interest, the mixed technical signals and potential risks from increased adoption suggest a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators and a recent price increase suggest a slight positive bias, though momentum remains weak.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent price increases are not supported by strong technical or on-chain activity, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In the absence of strong bullish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent for capital preservation."
2024-12-01 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with low volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 13.4. The S&P 500 remains strong, suggesting a positive risk sentiment in broader markets. However, the U.S. Dollar Index is high, which could exert downward pressure on crypto assets. Bitcoin's market data reveals a lack of bullish signals, despite increased institutional interest, which introduces new risks. Ethereum maintains a buy trend signal but lacks momentum, while Solana and Dogecoin show no clear buy signals and have experienced recent price declines. Tether remains stable, though its market cap was recently surpassed by XRP, indicating shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite institutional interest, technical indicators are weak, and the high DXY suggests potential downward pressure. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.2 — Consistent buy trend signal and slight price recovery suggest a modest increase in allocation, though momentum remains weak.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant technical or news-driven catalysts to warrant a change in allocation. Hold current position.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent price volatility without clear directional signals or news influence suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the lack of strong bullish signals in other assets and the high DXY, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable U.S. Dollar Index and low volatility in the S&P 500, suggesting a relatively calm market backdrop. However, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin is facing potential risks due to increased institutional involvement, which could lead to volatility despite its recent price appreciation. Ethereum shows a consistent buy trend, but lacks significant news to drive momentum. Solana and Dogecoin are experiencing normal activity without any major news catalysts. Tether remains stable, though its market position has been slightly overshadowed by XRP's recent rise in market cap. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with a slight preference for stability and established assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.2 — Despite institutional interest, the lack of bullish technical signals and potential risks suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and stable price activity make Ethereum relatively attractive, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant technical or news-driven catalysts to justify a change in position. Hold current allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and lack of news suggest maintaining the current position without changes.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of potential market volatility and the need for liquidity, increasing USDT holdings provides a buffer against market fluctuations."
2024-12-01 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable yet cautious sentiment with low volatility (VIX at 13.4) and a strong U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 106.21). The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals with Bitcoin showing increased institutional interest, which introduces both potential upside and new risks. Ethereum maintains a positive trend signal, though without strong momentum. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news or technical signals, while Tether remains stable but faces competition from XRP in market capitalization rankings. Overall, the market sentiment is neutral to slightly bullish, with a cautious approach warranted due to mixed technical signals and macroeconomic stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Institutional interest is a positive long-term signal, but current technicals are neutral. Maintain a small positive bias due to potential strategic reserve discussions.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators suggest potential for upside, despite lack of significant news. Maintain a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant technical or news-driven catalysts. Hold current position as there is no clear directional signal.

DOGE: -0.1 — Despite a recent buy signal from trend indicators, the lack of momentum and significant news suggests a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed signals across other assets and stable macroeconomic conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity option."
2024-12-01 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility (VIX at 13.4) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a risk-on sentiment in traditional markets. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains elevated, which could exert some pressure on cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which introduces both potential upside and new risks. Ethereum shows consistent technical buy signals, although without significant news catalysts. Solana and Dogecoin lack strong directional signals, while Tether's position as a stablecoin remains solid despite being overtaken by XRP in market capitalization.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Institutional interest is a positive long-term development, but the lack of immediate bullish technical signals tempers enthusiasm. Current holdings are minimal, allowing for a slight increase.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from technical indicators suggest potential upside. The absence of negative news supports a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining current exposure is prudent given the lack of clear direction.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a slight upward price movement, the lack of significant news or technical momentum suggests holding the current position.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the overall risk-on sentiment and the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-12-01 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a slight upward trend in prices across major cryptocurrencies, despite mixed technical signals. Bitcoin has seen a recent price increase, but institutional adoption introduces new risks, potentially leading to increased volatility. Ethereum maintains a steady upward trend, with technical indicators suggesting potential for growth. Solana's price has seen a significant increase, although technical indicators remain mixed. Dogecoin shows bullish momentum, supported by technical signals. Tether remains stable, but the news of XRP surpassing it in market capitalization may influence perceptions of stability and liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the potential risks associated with increased institutional adoption, the recent price increase and bullish momentum suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent buy signals from technical indicators and a stable price increase warrant a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Significant price increase suggests potential for further growth, but mixed technical indicators call for cautious optimism.

DOGE: +0.4 — Bullish momentum and consistent buy signals from technical indicators support a positive allocation.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintain a neutral stance on USDT as a stablecoin, given the current market conditions and the absence of significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX at 13.4, and a strong S&P 500 index. This suggests a risk-on sentiment in traditional markets, which can spill over into the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin has shown signs of bullish momentum with its short-term moving average crossing above the long-term, although institutional involvement introduces new risks. Ethereum maintains a buy signal with consistent on-chain activity, but lacks significant news catalysts. Solana and Dogecoin both exhibit bullish momentum, with Solana showing a significant price increase recently. Tether remains stable, but with XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, there may be shifts in stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Recent bullish momentum and institutional interest, despite associated risks, suggest a moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals and stable on-chain activity support a slight increase in allocation, although lacking news catalysts.

SOL: +0.4 — Significant price increase and bullish momentum suggest a favorable environment for further capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite low on-chain activity, bullish momentum and consistent buy signals justify a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — With a risk-on sentiment in the market, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-12-01 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of bullish momentum despite institutional adoption concerns. Ethereum maintains a positive trend signal, although momentum is lacking. Solana's price has been volatile, but recent bullish momentum suggests potential upside. Dogecoin's recent price drop and low activity indicate uncertainty, while USDT remains a stable choice amid market fluctuations. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, supports a moderate risk-on environment, though the U.S. dollar's strength could weigh on crypto prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite institutional risk concerns, Bitcoin's bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest potential upside. 

ETH: +0.3 — Positive trend signals, but lacking momentum. The absence of significant news keeps the outlook moderately positive.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent bullish momentum and normal on-chain activity support a cautious buy, but lack of news keeps the signal moderate.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a recent price drop and low activity. No significant news to drive sentiment.

USDT: -0.2 — With a moderate risk-on sentiment, some capital rotation out of stablecoins is justified, but maintain some exposure due to market uncertainties."
2024-12-01 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Solana has shown some positive price movement and bullish momentum, but lacks a clear trend signal. Dogecoin maintains a buy trend signal, but lacks significant on-chain activity or news to support a strong position. Tether remains stable, but the recent news of XRP surpassing it in market cap could indicate a shift in investor preference away from stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and institutional interest suggest potential for further gains. The risk of increased institutional involvement is noted, but overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a positive trend signal, the lack of momentum and significant news leaves Ethereum in a neutral position. Holding current exposure is advisable.

SOL: +0.3 — Recent price increases and bullish momentum are positive, but the absence of a clear trend signal suggests a cautious approach. Slightly increase exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although it has a buy trend signal, the lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest maintaining current holdings without increasing exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish sentiment in other assets and XRP surpassing Tether in market cap, there is a slight preference to reduce exposure to stablecoins in favor of more volatile assets."
2024-12-01 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum supported by both technical indicators and increased on-chain activity. However, the news of increased institutional involvement introduces potential risks, which could lead to volatility. Ethereum is experiencing sideways movement with no significant news to drive momentum, while Solana's technical indicators are mixed. Dogecoin has seen a slight decrease in price but maintains a buy signal from technical indicators. Tether remains stable, but recent news highlights a shift in market capitalization rankings, which could impact its relative attractiveness.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum, though the news of institutional risks tempers enthusiasm slightly.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, and the absence of significant news leaves it in a holding pattern without clear directional signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite lacking a buy signal from trend indicators, Solana's bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity provide moderate support for a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's technical indicators are mixed, with no significant news to drive sentiment, suggesting a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of risk appetite, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is sensible, especially given the recent shift in market cap rankings."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin is experiencing strong on-chain activity and upward momentum, although increased institutional involvement introduces potential risks. Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, but the absence of significant news leaves it in a neutral position. Solana shows bullish momentum despite a lack of news and a neutral trend signal. Dogecoin's technical indicators are mixed, with low on-chain activity despite a recent price increase. Tether remains stable, but the news of XRP surpassing it in market capitalization might affect its perceived stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum suggest continued upward potential, but institutional risks warrant some caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Positive trend signals are present, but the lack of news and mixed momentum suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a moderate positive outlook despite the absence of significant news.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance, with no compelling reason to adjust current holdings.

USDT: -0.4 — With a slightly bullish market sentiment, there is a moderate preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2024-12-01 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most assets showing slight price increases and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by increased institutional interest, although this introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana maintain a stable outlook with no significant news, while Dogecoin shows mixed signals with no major developments. Tether remains stable, but its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been overtaken by XRP, indicating a potential shift in market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators show a buy signal, the lack of significant news and mixed momentum suggest a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite no buy signal from trend indicators, positive momentum and stable on-chain activity warrant a slight increase in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and no significant news lead to a neutral stance, maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market shows signs of bullish sentiment, reducing exposure to stablecoins in favor of more volatile assets is prudent."
2024-12-01 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum shows consistent buy signals but lacks significant news to drive momentum. Solana is exhibiting bullish momentum despite not having a strong trend signal. Dogecoin is relatively stable with no significant news or technical signals. Tether remains stable, but its position as a safe haven is slightly weakened by XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, indicating a potential shift in investor preference towards more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with increased institutional interest, suggest a bullish outlook despite potential risks.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals from trend indicators, but lack of significant news keeps the bullish sentiment moderate.

SOL: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and consistent price increases, though lacking a strong trend signal, suggest a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with no significant news or strong technical indicators, suggesting a hold position.

USDT: -0.2 — With a slight bullish sentiment in the market and XRP overtaking it in market cap, there is a modest inclination to reduce exposure to stablecoins."
2024-12-01 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of upward momentum and increased on-chain activity. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest, which could introduce volatility but also suggests confidence in its long-term potential. Ethereum and Solana are maintaining stable technical indicators without significant news impact. Dogecoin has shown a notable price increase, possibly indicating a breakout, while Tether remains stable despite being overtaken by XRP in market capitalization. The macroeconomic context, with relatively low volatility and stable S&P 500, supports a moderate risk-on environment, favoring increased exposure to cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong buy signals from both trend and momentum indicators, coupled with institutional interest, suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the lack of significant news, Ethereum's technical indicators remain positive, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — While lacking a strong trend signal, Solana's consistent bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity support a slight positive bias.

DOGE: +0.5 — Significant price increase and bullish momentum indicate a potential breakout, justifying a higher allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive signals across other cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibiting strong upward momentum supported by positive technical indicators. Bitcoin's increased institutional adoption introduces both opportunities and risks, as highlighted by recent discussions about its potential inclusion in a U.S. strategic reserve. Ethereum and Solana are maintaining their bullish momentum, with no significant news impacting their short-term outlook. Dogecoin has shown recent price volatility but lacks significant news or technical signals to suggest a strong directional move. Tether remains stable, but its relative attractiveness is diminished as XRP surpasses it in market capitalization, indicating a shift in capital allocation preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and bullish momentum, supported by institutional interest, suggest continued upward potential. However, the risks associated with increased institutional involvement warrant a slightly cautious approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Consistent bullish momentum and strong technical indicators, though lacking significant news catalysts. The overall market sentiment remains positive, supporting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive momentum and technical indicators, but without significant news to drive a stronger signal. The asset remains attractive in a bullish market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite recent price volatility, there are no major technical or news-driven catalysts to justify a directional move. Maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market sentiment leaning bullish, there is less need for stablecoin exposure. Capital rotation into more volatile assets is favored as risk appetite increases."
2024-12-01 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies demonstrating bullish technical indicators and momentum signals. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce both opportunities and risks. Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin show consistent buy signals across technical indicators, though without significant news to drive sentiment. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility and a strong S&P 500, suggesting a supportive backdrop for risk assets. However, the recent overtaking of Tether by XRP in market capitalization may indicate shifting dynamics in stablecoin demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the risks highlighted by institutional involvement, Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity suggest continued upward potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals across technical indicators, though lacking significant news to drive a stronger sentiment shift.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive technical indicators and stable on-chain activity support a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — While technical indicators are positive, the lack of significant news or volume changes suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.2 — With a generally bullish market sentiment, there is a slight preference to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, though the move is cautious given the lack of USDT holdings."
2024-12-01 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a generally positive sentiment for cryptocurrencies, with bullish technical indicators across most assets. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce both opportunities and risks due to its rapid price appreciation. Ethereum and Solana maintain strong technical signals, although Ethereum lacks significant news to drive sentiment. Dogecoin shows bullish momentum with a recent price uptick, while Tether's relative market position has been impacted by XRP overtaking it in market capitalization. The macroeconomic context, including stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, supports a moderate risk-on environment, suggesting potential for capital allocation into riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential risks from institutional adoption, strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — While lacking significant news, Ethereum's technical indicators remain bullish, supporting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Although the short-term trend signal has weakened, overall momentum remains positive, justifying a slight positive bias.

DOGE: +0.1 — Recent price increase and bullish momentum warrant a cautious positive stance, though without significant news.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a stable macro environment, maintain a neutral stance as risk appetite remains moderate."
2024-12-01 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with most cryptocurrencies showing positive technical indicators, such as buy signals from moving averages and bullish momentum from MACD. Bitcoin is experiencing increased institutional interest, which could introduce volatility but also signifies growing legitimacy. Ethereum and Solana lack significant news, but their technical indicators suggest stability. Dogecoin has shown a significant price increase, indicating potential speculative interest. Tether remains stable, but its position has been challenged by XRP's rise in market capitalization, reflecting shifts in investor preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite potential risks from increased institutional involvement, Bitcoin's technical indicators are strong, and the price is showing upward momentum. The asset remains a key component of the portfolio.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, with no significant news to drive sentiment. It remains stable without a clear directional bias.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's technical indicators suggest bullish momentum, and despite the lack of news, it has shown resilience in price stability.

DOGE: +0.6 — Dogecoin's significant price increase and bullish momentum indicate strong speculative interest, warranting increased allocation.

USDT: -0.2 — With bullish signals across other assets, there's a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets with upward potential."
2024-12-01 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with Bitcoin and Dogecoin showing strong upward momentum supported by technical indicators and on-chain activity. Bitcoin's price is buoyed by institutional interest, although this introduces new risks. Ethereum and Solana exhibit mixed signals, with Ethereum lacking a bullish momentum signal despite a consistent buy trend. Solana's technical indicators are less supportive, with no significant news to drive sentiment. Dogecoin shows strong momentum but has experienced recent volatility. Tether remains stable, but its relative attractiveness is diminished by XRP surpassing it in market capitalization, suggesting a shift in capital flows.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Strong technical indicators and institutional interest support a positive outlook, but new risks warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a consistent buy trend, the lack of bullish momentum and absence of significant news suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and no significant news lead to a neutral position, maintaining current exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Strong momentum and activity surge support a positive outlook, but recent price volatility suggests caution.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2024-12-01 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with a low volatility index (VIX) and a strong S&P 500, indicating a generally positive risk sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum with increased institutional interest, although this also introduces new risks. Ethereum shows consistent buy signals but lacks recent news catalysts. Solana's technical indicators are mixed, with bullish momentum but no significant buy signals. Dogecoin has shown recent price increases and bullish momentum, but lacks significant news. Tether remains stable, though its market cap has been surpassed by XRP, indicating potential shifts in stablecoin preferences.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with institutional interest, suggest a favorable outlook despite potential risks.

ETH: +0.3 — Consistent buy signals from technical indicators, but the absence of significant news and mixed momentum suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — Bullish momentum is present, but the lack of a buy signal in trend indicators and absence of news mean a moderate allocation is appropriate.

DOGE: +0.5 — Strong bullish momentum and recent price increases support a positive outlook, although the lack of news suggests a moderate level of confidence.

USDT: 0.0 — With no current holdings and the market showing a risk-on sentiment, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is appropriate as capital rotates into riskier assets."

Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Dogecoin showing strong upward momentum supported by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin's continued accumulation by MicroStrategy and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options are boosting confidence. Ethereum, despite strong fund inflows, is experiencing short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price drops. Solana faces some uncertainty due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing bullish momentum with potential for a significant rally. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news, including significant institutional accumulation and new ETF options, suggests a favorable outlook.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong fund inflows, recent price drops and bearish sentiment warrant caution, leading to a slightly negative outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with technical challenges and security concerns, but potential for stabilization keeps the outlook neutral.

DOGE: +0.6 — Bullish momentum and potential for a significant rally support a positive allocation, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-12-02 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with bullish signals in several assets, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, supported by significant institutional interest and new financial products like Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum, despite recent inflows into funds, is facing short-term bearish sentiment due to momentum loss. Solana is stabilizing after a security incident, with analysts expecting price consolidation. Dogecoin is showing a volatile uptrend with potential for further gains, driven by speculative interest. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a conducive environment for risk assets, though the strong U.S. dollar may temper some enthusiasm.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and institutional interest through ETF options and MicroStrategy's continued accumulation support a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite short-term bearish momentum, significant fund inflows indicate underlying investor interest, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent security concerns and lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance as the market waits for further stabilization.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and speculative interest, along with potential for a 'Santa Rally,' support a moderately positive allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2024-12-02 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin continues to see strong institutional interest, highlighted by MicroStrategy's significant purchase and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, which could further drive demand. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, although recent price declines indicate some short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces challenges due to a security issue in its development ecosystem, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend, with potential for a significant rally. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, which may support risk-on behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and positive technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum. ETF-related developments also provide a supportive backdrop.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence. Technicals are mixed, but the overall outlook remains positive.

SOL: -0.1 — Security concerns and a lack of clear bullish signals suggest caution. However, potential price stabilization offers some support.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a significant rally make DOGE attractive, despite its volatility.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, USDT remains a neutral holding as the market shows signs of increased risk appetite."
2024-12-02 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals with some bullish momentum, particularly in Bitcoin and Dogecoin, driven by positive news and technical indicators. Bitcoin's recent ETF-related developments and MicroStrategy's continued accumulation are bolstering its outlook. Ethereum, while experiencing significant fund inflows, faces short-term bearish sentiment due to recent price declines. Solana is experiencing technical challenges, yet analysts expect price stabilization within a defined range. Dogecoin is showing a volatile uptrend with potential for a significant rally. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility and steady interest rates, suggesting a cautious but optimistic market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and positive news from ETF options and institutional accumulation suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate underlying investor interest, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges and recent price declines suggest caution; however, expected price stabilization provides a neutral outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a 'Santa Rally' support a positive allocation, despite recent volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate."
2024-12-02 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of bullish momentum despite some recent volatility. Bitcoin continues to see strong institutional interest, highlighted by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could drive further demand. Ethereum is experiencing significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price declines suggest some short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces challenges with a recent supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is riding a wave of bullish momentum, with potential for a ""Santa Rally."" The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, suggesting a conducive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and ETF-related developments support a bullish outlook. On-chain activity is low, but the overall momentum remains positive.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest. However, technical indicators show mixed signals, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent security concerns and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a neutral stance. Price stabilization is expected, but caution is advised.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish momentum and potential for a significant rally support a positive outlook. However, volatility remains high, necessitating careful monitoring.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment reflects a stable yet cautious market sentiment, with low volatility as indicated by the VIX and a strong S&P 500 index. Bitcoin and Ethereum show mixed signals; while Bitcoin is buoyed by institutional interest and new financial products, Ethereum faces short-term bearish sentiment despite strong fund inflows. Solana is under pressure due to a security issue but is expected to stabilize. Dogecoin is experiencing volatility with potential for a bullish rally, while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price fluctuations, positive news from institutional investments and new ETF options support a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor interest, but recent price declines suggest caution. A slight positive allocation is warranted.

SOL: -0.3 — Security concerns and recent price breakdowns suggest reducing exposure until stability is confirmed.

DOGE: +0.4 — Potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent bullish momentum support a moderate buy signal, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintain current exposure as a hedge against market volatility, given the mixed signals across other assets."
2024-12-02 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of investor interest despite recent price declines. Bitcoin's recent ETF-related developments and MicroStrategy's continued accumulation suggest a supportive backdrop, though technical indicators remain mixed. Ethereum has seen significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest, but recent price declines suggest caution. Solana faces technical challenges with a recent supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends, with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" while Tether remains stable amid the broader market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, strong institutional interest and ETF developments provide a supportive backdrop. Mixed technicals suggest caution, but overall sentiment remains positive.

ETH: +0.2 — Significant fund inflows indicate strong investor interest, though recent price declines warrant a cautious approach. The potential for recovery exists if momentum improves.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent technical issues and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Price stabilization is expected, but current risks warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish momentum and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" make DOGE relatively attractive, though recent volatility suggests a measured approach.

USDT: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in sentiment. Maintaining a neutral stance as the market assesses risk appetite."
2024-12-02 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin continues to see strong institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's ongoing accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide a supportive backdrop. Ethereum is experiencing significant fund inflows, indicating investor interest, but is facing short-term bearish momentum. Solana is dealing with security concerns due to a supply chain attack, although analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing potential for a bullish rally, but recent price volatility suggests caution. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and low volatility, does not suggest any immediate risk-off sentiment, but the market remains sensitive to technical signals and news developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price dip, strong institutional interest and ETF developments provide a positive outlook. The on-chain activity remains low, but the macroeconomic environment supports a moderate bullish stance.

ETH: +0.3 — While facing short-term bearish momentum, the significant fund inflows suggest underlying investor confidence. The technicals are not strongly supportive, but the news indicates potential for recovery.

SOL: 0.0 — Security concerns from the supply chain attack and a lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance. The price is expected to stabilize, but caution is warranted.

DOGE: +0.2 — The potential for a 'Santa Rally' and recent bullish news provide some optimism, but recent price volatility and lack of strong technical support warrant a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets due to positive developments in BTC and ETH, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable in the current environment."
2024-12-02 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a general bearish trend observed in the short-term price movements of major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Despite this, there are positive developments such as MicroStrategy's continued BTC accumulation and significant inflows into ETH funds, indicating strong institutional interest. However, technical indicators and recent price actions suggest caution, as many assets are trading below key moving averages and Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, but the crypto market is experiencing increased volatility and uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price decreases, the ongoing accumulation by MicroStrategy and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options provide a supportive backdrop. However, technical indicators remain bearish, warranting a cautious positive stance.

ETH: +0.1 — Strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest, but recent price declines and technical breakdowns suggest a need for caution. The score reflects a slightly positive outlook due to institutional support.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent supply chain attack poses risks, and technical indicators are bearish. However, analysts forecast price stabilization, leading to a neutral stance as we await clearer signals.

DOGE: -0.3 — Despite news of potential bullish momentum, recent significant price drops and technical breakdowns suggest reducing exposure. The score reflects a cautious approach given the volatility.

USDT: +0.5 — With the overall bearish sentiment and technical breakdowns in other assets, maintaining liquidity in USDT is prudent. The score reflects a preference for stability in uncertain market conditions."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has seen aggressive accumulation by institutional players like MicroStrategy, which is a positive signal, but technical indicators remain weak. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, suggesting investor interest, but recent price drops indicate short-term bearish momentum. Solana is facing technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential bullish rally, although recent price volatility suggests caution. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, indicates a relatively calm broader market environment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could exert downward pressure on crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite weak technical indicators, the continuous institutional accumulation and ETF-related developments provide a positive outlook. The macroeconomic environment is stable, which supports a moderate increase in BTC allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest, although recent price drops suggest caution. The overall sentiment is mixed, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent supply chain attack introduces uncertainty, and while price stabilization is expected, the lack of strong bullish signals suggests maintaining current exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and bullish sentiment could drive prices higher, but recent volatility warrants a cautious approach. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment across other assets and potential for bullish moves in BTC and DOGE, a slight reduction in USDT is appropriate to reallocate capital towards more promising opportunities."
2024-12-02 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing recent price declines and technical indicators showing bearish signals. Bitcoin's price has been declining, but news of continued institutional interest, such as MicroStrategy's purchase and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, provides a potential bullish counterbalance. Ethereum has seen significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest despite recent price drops. Solana faces technical challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts predict price stabilization. Dogecoin shows potential for a bullish rally, though recent price action has been volatile. In a generally bearish environment, USDT remains a safe haven despite lacking significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, institutional interest and new ETF options suggest potential for recovery. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.1 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, but recent price drops warrant caution. Slightly increase exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical issues and recent price declines offset potential stabilization forecasts. Hold current position.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and bullish sentiment provide a slight positive outlook. Increase exposure slightly.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, maintain some exposure to USDT for stability, but slightly reduce to capitalize on potential recovery in other assets."
2024-12-02 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with some positive developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum, while technical indicators across most assets suggest caution. Bitcoin is seeing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide a bullish backdrop. Ethereum is experiencing significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest, although recent price momentum has been negative. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, which might weigh on sentiment despite expectations of price stabilization. Dogecoin shows potential for a short-term rally, but its volatility remains high. Overall, the macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with low volatility in traditional markets, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish outlook for crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and ETF developments are positive, but technical indicators suggest caution. A moderate increase in allocation is warranted.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

SOL: 0.0 — While price stabilization is expected, the recent security issue could weigh on sentiment. Maintain current exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a short-term rally exists, but high volatility suggests a cautious approach. A slight increase in allocation is reasonable.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased interest in BTC and ETH, a moderate reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2024-12-02 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by technical indicators and recent price movements. Bitcoin's price is stabilizing despite MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide some long-term bullish support. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, suggesting investor interest, but recent price declines indicate short-term bearish momentum. Solana faces technical challenges with a recent supply chain attack, yet analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin shows potential for a bullish rally, but recent volatility suggests caution. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a low volatility index, suggests a neutral to cautious approach, favoring stable assets like USDT in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, the ongoing institutional interest and ETF developments provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin. 

ETH: +0.1 — Strong fund inflows indicate investor confidence, but recent price declines and bearish momentum suggest caution.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent supply chain attack introduces uncertainty, offsetting any potential bullish sentiment from price stabilization forecasts.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and increased transaction activity suggest some bullish potential, but recent volatility warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for further volatility, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some positive developments, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin continues to see strong institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide further regulated exposure and support for BTC. Ethereum is experiencing significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest despite recent price declines. Solana faces some technical challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization within a defined range. Dogecoin shows potential for a bullish rally, driven by speculative interest and recent price volatility. Overall, the macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with no significant shifts in major indicators like the U.S. Dollar Index or S&P 500, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and new ETF options are positive catalysts, though technical indicators are not yet bullish. Current holdings should be maintained with a slight increase.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows suggest underlying investor confidence, despite recent price drops. Maintain current holdings with a slight increase.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the recent technical issue, the price is expected to stabilize. Hold current position until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative interest and potential for a 'Santa Rally' provide a slight positive bias, though volatility remains high. Maintain current holdings with a slight increase.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased interest in risk assets like BTC and ETH, reduce exposure to USDT to reallocate capital towards more promising opportunities."
2024-12-02 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of institutional interest through significant inflows and strategic acquisitions. Despite recent technical indicators not signaling strong buy opportunities, the news of MicroStrategy's continued BTC purchases and Ethereum's fund inflows suggest underlying bullish sentiment. Solana faces some technical challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts predict price stabilization, indicating potential resilience. Dogecoin is experiencing a volatile uptrend with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" suggesting speculative interest. The macroeconomic context remains relatively stable with low volatility, which may support risk-on behavior in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional accumulation and ETF developments provide a strong bullish backdrop, despite technical indicators not yet confirming a buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant fund inflows suggest strong investor interest, though recent price drops temper enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: 0.0 — Technical challenges from the supply chain attack offset potential price stabilization, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.5 — Speculative interest and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" support a positive outlook, despite technical volatility.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive news in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is warranted."
2024-12-02 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has seen continued institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could drive further demand. Ethereum is experiencing strong fund inflows, indicating robust investor interest, despite some short-term bearish sentiment. Solana is facing challenges due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is gaining attention with potential bullish momentum, driven by speculative interest in a ""Santa Rally."" The macroeconomic context remains stable, with no significant changes in indicators that would drastically affect crypto markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional accumulation and new ETF options suggest strong demand, supported by recent price increases and bullish momentum.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price drops, strong fund inflows indicate solid investor interest, warranting a positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — While facing a security issue, the price is expected to stabilize; thus, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest and potential for a ""Santa Rally"" provide a slight bullish bias, though volatility remains high.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2024-12-02 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could provide a bullish underpinning. Ethereum is seeing significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest despite recent price declines. Solana faces technical challenges with a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing volatility with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" though recent price swings suggest uncertainty. The macroeconomic context, with stable gold and oil prices and a low VIX, suggests a relatively calm broader market environment, which might not heavily influence crypto markets in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, the strong institutional interest and ETF-related developments provide a bullish outlook. The market's overall sentiment and on-chain activity suggest potential for recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — Significant fund inflows indicate strong investor interest, which could counteract recent bearish momentum. The technicals are mixed, but the long-term outlook remains positive.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent security issue and mixed technical signals suggest caution. While analysts expect price stabilization, the current environment does not strongly favor increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — The potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent price volatility indicate a speculative opportunity, though the lack of strong technical support warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the mixed sentiment across the market and potential for recovery in risk assets, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets could be beneficial."
2024-12-02 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has shown resilience with bullish momentum signals, bolstered by MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options by Cboe. Ethereum is experiencing strong investor interest, as evidenced by significant fund inflows, despite recent price declines due to momentum loss. Solana faces challenges from a supply chain attack but is expected to stabilize within a defined price range. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends, with potential for a ""Santa Rally"" that could push prices higher. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a neutral to slightly positive environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum, supported by positive news such as MicroStrategy's continued purchases and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options. This indicates a favorable outlook for BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, Ethereum's strong fund inflows signal robust investor interest, suggesting potential for recovery and growth.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana has experienced a recent price increase, the supply chain attack poses risks, and the market is expected to consolidate within a range, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Dogecoin's potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent price increases suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2024-12-02 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing positive news with continued institutional interest, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's substantial purchase and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could drive future demand. Ethereum is witnessing strong fund inflows, indicating investor interest, although recent price declines suggest short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces potential risks due to a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization within a defined range. Dogecoin shows potential for a bullish rally, although it remains volatile. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and low volatility, suggests a neutral to slightly positive risk environment, with no major shifts in the U.S. dollar or gold prices.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and ETF developments provide a strong supportive backdrop, despite mixed short-term technicals.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate positive long-term sentiment, though recent price declines warrant cautious optimism.

SOL: 0.0 — Potential risks from a supply chain attack balance out with expectations of price stabilization, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.2 — Potential for a 'Santa Rally' and bullish sentiment, but high volatility suggests a moderate approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely."
2024-12-02 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Solana faces technical challenges due to a supply chain attack but is expected to stabilize within a defined price range. Dogecoin shows potential for a rally, driven by bullish sentiment and price volatility. The macroeconomic backdrop, with stable interest rates and low volatility in traditional markets, supports a balanced approach to crypto asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF developments provide a supportive backdrop, despite recent price volatility and mixed technical signals.

ETH: +0.3 — Strong fund inflows indicate robust investor interest, although recent price declines suggest caution. Overall, a moderate positive outlook is warranted.

SOL: 0.0 — The recent supply chain attack introduces risk, but expected price stabilization within a range suggests a neutral stance for now.

DOGE: +0.4 — Bullish sentiment and potential for a 'Santa Rally' provide a positive outlook, despite recent price fluctuations.

USDT: 0.0 — With no significant news and a stable macroeconomic environment, maintaining a neutral position on USDT is appropriate given the current risk appetite in the market."
2024-12-02 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bullish tilt, driven by significant news and developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing positive momentum due to MicroStrategy's continued accumulation and the launch of Bitcoin ETF options, which could enhance institutional interest. Ethereum is seeing strong fund inflows, indicating robust investor interest, although recent price declines suggest short-term bearish sentiment. Solana faces potential risks from a supply chain attack, but analysts expect price stabilization. Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential rally, supported by bullish analyst predictions. The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with no major shifts in traditional financial indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news from MicroStrategy and ETF options launch are strong bullish signals, indicating potential for further price appreciation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows suggest underlying investor confidence, warranting a positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — While price stabilization is expected, the recent supply chain attack poses risks, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: +0.3 — Bullish sentiment and potential for a 'Santa Rally' support a modest positive allocation, despite recent volatility.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin showing some positive developments due to institutional interest and new financial products, such as the Bitcoin ETF options. Ethereum has seen significant fund inflows, indicating strong investor interest, but recent price momentum has been bearish. Solana faces technical vulnerabilities, yet analysts predict price stabilization. Dogecoin is experiencing volatile uptrends with potential for a ""Santa Rally,"" while Tether remains stable without significant news. The macroeconomic context, with low volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious but potentially opportunistic environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and new financial products are bolstering Bitcoin's appeal, despite mixed technical signals. The macroeconomic environment supports risk assets, making BTC relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, strong fund inflows suggest underlying investor confidence. However, technicals are mixed, warranting a cautious but positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — While there is potential for price stabilization, recent security concerns and lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance for now.

DOGE: +0.2 — The potential for a ""Santa Rally"" and recent bullish momentum provide some upside potential, though volatility remains a concern.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally supportive environment for risk assets and positive developments in other cryptocurrencies, maintaining high exposure to USDT is less attractive."
2024-12-02 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.
