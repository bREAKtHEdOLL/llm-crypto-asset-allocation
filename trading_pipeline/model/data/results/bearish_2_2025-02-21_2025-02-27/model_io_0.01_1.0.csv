2025-02-21 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The crypto market is experiencing heightened volatility due to a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been notably impacted, with Bitcoin dropping from near $100k to $97k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. This incident has overshadowed positive news, such as Coinbase's legal victory. Solana, despite facing network throughput issues, has seen institutional interest with Franklin Templeton's ETF filing. Dogecoin is under pressure from potential sell-offs due to large whale movements, while Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amidst global regulatory challenges. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with increased risk aversion following the hack.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent Bybit hack has caused significant sell pressure and market uncertainty, warranting caution despite previous bullish signals.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's price is under pressure due to the Bybit hack, and regulatory concerns are growing, suggesting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — Institutional interest from the ETF filing provides some positive sentiment, but network issues and price pressure limit the upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — Potential sell pressure from whale movements is balanced by a lack of significant positive catalysts, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of increased market volatility and risk aversion, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The crypto market is currently experiencing a mixed sentiment with a significant impact from a recent $1.5 billion hack at Bybit, which has led to a sell-off, particularly affecting Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite the hack, Bitcoin's technical indicators remain bullish with strong on-chain activity, while Ethereum shows less momentum. Solana is seeing positive institutional interest with an ETF filing, although its network throughput has been under pressure. Dogecoin is facing potential sell pressure due to a large transfer to Binance. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amidst global regulatory challenges, maintaining its role as a stable asset in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent hack-induced dip, Bitcoin's strong technical indicators and on-chain activity suggest resilience and potential for recovery.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing downward pressure from the Bybit hack, and its technical indicators are not showing strong momentum, warranting a cautious hold.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest from the ETF filing and positive technical indicators make Solana an attractive asset, despite recent network issues.

DOGE: 0.0 — Potential sell pressure from a large whale transfer creates uncertainty, but no significant changes in technical indicators suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With market volatility and potential recovery in other assets, some capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2025-02-21 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The market is currently experiencing a bearish sentiment, primarily driven by a significant security breach at Bybit, which has impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum prices negatively. This event has overshadowed positive news, such as Coinbase's legal victory, and has led to increased volatility and sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies. Despite this, Solana has seen some institutional interest with the filing of an ETF, although its network throughput has been under pressure. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its operations in Africa, indicating a strategic shift amid regulatory challenges in Western markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent hack at Bybit has created significant downward pressure on Bitcoin, with increased volatility and sell-offs. Despite bullish technical indicators, the negative sentiment warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit hack, with prices dipping significantly. However, the lack of current holdings and regulatory concerns suggest maintaining a neutral stance until the market stabilizes.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite network throughput issues, the filing of a Solana ETF indicates growing institutional interest, which could provide support. Current holdings justify a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although there is potential sell pressure from a large whale transfer, there are no significant changes in technical indicators or sentiment to justify a move.

USDT: +0.2 — With the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-02-21 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by the recent $1.5 billion hack at Bybit, which has caused significant sell-offs in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This event has overshadowed positive news such as Coinbase's legal relief and Franklin Templeton's filing for a Solana ETF. The hack has led to increased market volatility and regulatory concerns, particularly affecting Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its operations in Africa, suggesting a strategic shift amid tightening regulations in the US and EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The Bybit hack has led to a significant sell-off and increased volatility, overshadowing any positive news. Given the current holdings, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the negative impact from the Bybit hack, Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, and without current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest via the Franklin Templeton ETF filing is a positive signal, although recent network issues and price pressure suggest caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — The whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential sell pressure, but without current holdings, a neutral position is justified.

USDT: +0.5 — In the face of increased market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining or increasing stablecoin holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-02-21 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautious due to the recent $1.5 billion hack at Bybit, which has led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This incident has overshadowed positive developments such as Coinbase's legal victory and Franklin Templeton's filing for a Solana ETF.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent hack at Bybit has created significant downward pressure on Bitcoin, warranting a cautious approach given the current holdings.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing similar pressures as Bitcoin due to the hack, but with no current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent amidst mixed signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive institutional interest from the Franklin Templeton ETF filing and ongoing buy signals suggest a favorable outlook, justifying an increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although there is potential sell pressure from a large whale transfer, the lack of significant technical changes or holdings suggests maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.3 — With heightened market volatility and security concerns, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven, balancing the portfolio amidst current uncertainties."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily due to the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable price declines, with Bitcoin dropping from around $100k to near $97k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. This incident has overshadowed positive news, such as Coinbase's legal victory. Solana, despite institutional interest indicated by Franklin Templeton's ETF filing, is also under pressure due to network throughput issues and price declines. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is facing potential sell pressure due to large whale movements. In this environment, USDT remains a safe haven as it expands operations in Africa amidst global regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent hack at Bybit has triggered a sell-off, and despite some positive legal news, the overall sentiment remains negative. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market conditions.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum has been significantly affected by the Bybit hack, with a large price drop. However, the lack of current holdings and mixed sentiment suggest maintaining a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite price pressure and network issues, the institutional interest shown by the ETF filing provides some positive sentiment. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — The potential sell pressure from whale activity is concerning, but without current holdings, maintaining a neutral position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for a safe haven, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-21 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has caused a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This hack has led to increased volatility and has overshadowed any positive news, such as Coinbase's legal relief. Solana, while facing its own challenges with network throughput issues, has seen some institutional interest through ETF filings. Dogecoin is experiencing potential sell pressure due to large whale movements, and Tether is expanding into new markets amid regulatory pressures, suggesting a strategic diversification effort.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the buy signal from technical indicators, the recent hack and subsequent sell-off have created a bearish sentiment. Current holdings should be reduced slightly to mitigate risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is experiencing similar bearish pressure due to the Bybit hack. However, without current holdings, a neutral stance is maintained to observe further developments.

SOL: +0.2 — The ETF filing indicates potential institutional interest, which could support price recovery despite recent network issues. Maintain a slight positive allocation given existing holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale movement to Binance raises concerns about potential sell pressure, but without current holdings, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent for capital preservation and liquidity."
2025-02-21 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The hack has led to a substantial sell-off, causing a drop in prices and triggering liquidations. Despite some positive news, such as Coinbase's legal relief and institutional interest in Solana, the market is overshadowed by concerns about security and regulatory oversight. In this environment, risk aversion is likely to increase, with a potential shift towards stable assets like USDT for capital preservation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The Bybit hack has significantly impacted Bitcoin's price, and the market sentiment remains negative. Despite some technical buy signals, the overall risk is high, warranting a reduction in exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is similarly affected by the hack, with regulatory concerns adding to the uncertainty. While there is bullish momentum, the broader market context suggests caution.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the market downturn, Solana has institutional interest with the ETF filing, which could provide some support. However, network issues and price pressure limit the upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential sell pressure, but there are no strong signals to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent for capital preservation, given its stability and the current risk-off sentiment."
2025-02-21 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautious, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced price declines due to the hack, with Bitcoin dropping from around $100k to near $97k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. Despite this, there are pockets of positive developments, such as Franklin Templeton's interest in Solana through an ETF filing, indicating institutional interest. However, Solana's network throughput issues and Dogecoin's potential sell pressure from a large whale transfer to Binance add to the market's volatility. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its operations in Africa, reflecting strategic moves amid regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The Bybit hack has introduced significant downside risk, and the recent price drop suggests a cautious stance is warranted. Given current holdings, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the negative impact from the Bybit hack, Ethereum's technical indicators remain relatively stable. A neutral stance is appropriate until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest via the ETF filing is a positive long-term signal, but network issues temper enthusiasm. Maintaining a moderate positive allocation aligns with current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — The potential sell pressure from a large whale transfer creates uncertainty, but no immediate action is required given the lack of current holdings.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the current market volatility and potential for further downside, increasing USDT exposure as a safe haven is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with significant volatility following a major security breach at Bybit, which has impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum prices negatively. The hack has led to a sell-off and increased regulatory concerns, especially for Ethereum, which experienced a substantial outflow. Despite these challenges, Solana is seeing institutional interest with a new ETF filing, although its network faced throughput issues. Dogecoin's market is jittery due to a large whale transfer, while Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amidst regulatory pressures. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, suggesting a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent hack and subsequent sell-off have created downward pressure, despite some positive technical signals. Holding a small position warrants a cautious reduction.

ETH: 0.0 — Although Ethereum has bullish momentum, the significant hack-related sell-off and regulatory concerns suggest a neutral stance until the market stabilizes.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest through the ETF filing is a positive sign, and despite network issues, the price shows resilience. Maintaining a moderate positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the large whale transfer creates uncertainty. No current holdings suggest a wait-and-see approach.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market volatility and recent security concerns, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a safety net."
2025-02-21 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This event has overshadowed positive news such as Coinbase's legal victory, resulting in increased volatility and uncertainty. Solana, however, shows signs of institutional interest with the Franklin Templeton ETF filing, although it faces challenges with network throughput issues. Dogecoin is experiencing potential sell pressure due to large whale movements, while Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amid regulatory pressures in other regions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a buy signal from trend indicators, the recent hack at Bybit has created significant downward pressure and uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Although Ethereum is experiencing bullish momentum, the impact of the Bybit hack and regulatory concerns balance out the positive technical indicators, suggesting a hold position.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest from the ETF filing and strong bullish momentum make Solana relatively attractive, despite recent network issues.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale transfer to Binance introduces potential sell pressure, but the overall market data remains neutral, suggesting no immediate action.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT as a stable asset is prudent to mitigate risk."
2025-02-21 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently cautious due to the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The hack has caused substantial liquidations and has raised concerns about exchange security, overshadowing positive developments like Coinbase's legal relief. Despite the negative news, there is some institutional interest in Solana, as evidenced by Franklin Templeton's ETF filing. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amidst regulatory pressures in the US and EU, indicating a strategic pivot to maintain growth.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent hack at Bybit has created downward pressure on Bitcoin, and despite a buy signal from trend indicators, the overall sentiment is negative due to security concerns.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit hack, with significant price drops. However, the bullish momentum signal suggests potential stabilization, warranting a hold position.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite the market-wide downturn, institutional interest in Solana through an ETF filing provides a positive outlook, although recent network issues temper enthusiasm.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale transfer to Binance could indicate potential sell pressure, but without further developments, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market volatility and security concerns, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2025-02-21 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic despite recent setbacks, such as the $1.5B hack at Bybit, which caused a temporary dip in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, technical indicators for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest a recovery with strong buy signals and bullish momentum. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with moderate volatility and a strong S&P 500, which could support risk-on sentiment. Institutional interest in Solana is growing, as evidenced by Franklin Templeton's ETF filing, while Tether continues to expand its reach in Africa amid regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent hack-induced dip, BTC is showing strong recovery signals with bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity. The legal relief for Coinbase also adds a positive backdrop.

ETH: +0.3 — Although affected by the Bybit hack, ETH is rebounding with strong buy signals and bullish momentum. Regulatory concerns remain, but the technical outlook is supportive.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and strong technical indicators make SOL attractive. The ETF filing by Franklin Templeton highlights growing confidence in Solana's potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE has shown recent price increases, the whale transfer to Binance introduces uncertainty. The lack of significant news or technical changes suggests a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With improving sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious following a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a notable sell-off in major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. The hack has raised concerns about security and regulatory oversight, overshadowing positive developments such as Coinbase's legal victory. Despite the negative news, there are signs of institutional interest in Solana, as evidenced by Franklin Templeton's ETF filing. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its operations in Africa, reflecting its strategic adaptation to global regulatory challenges. In this environment, the market is experiencing volatility, with a mix of bearish news and some bullish institutional signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent hack at Bybit has created significant sell pressure and market uncertainty, despite some technical buy signals. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is heavily impacted by the Bybit hack, with a significant price drop and regulatory concerns. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current sentiment and market conditions.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the broader market downturn, institutional interest in Solana through ETF filings provides a positive outlook. Maintaining a slight positive bias is justified.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is potential sell pressure from large whale movements, the overall impact on market sentiment is neutral. No current holdings to adjust.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of market volatility and bearish sentiment, increasing exposure to USDT as a safe haven is advisable to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-21 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The market is experiencing a bearish sentiment, primarily due to the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a widespread sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both faced substantial downward pressure, exacerbated by the hack and subsequent liquidations. Solana, while also affected by the broader market downturn, has some positive institutional interest with the filing of a Solana ETF by Franklin Templeton. Dogecoin's market is jittery due to large whale movements, while Tether is expanding its presence in Africa amidst global regulatory challenges. Overall, the market is cautious with a preference for stability, reflected in the increased appeal of USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the buy signals from technical indicators, the recent security breach at Bybit has created significant downward pressure, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.4 — The largest-ever ETH theft and subsequent regulatory concerns have overshadowed positive technical signals, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Institutional interest from the ETF filing provides some support, although the overall market sentiment remains cautious due to network issues and price pressure.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale transfer to Binance creates uncertainty, but without current holdings, there is no immediate need to adjust exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."
2025-02-21 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The market is currently experiencing heightened volatility due to a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both been negatively impacted, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable drop from $100k to near $97k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. Despite these setbacks, there are positive developments such as Franklin Templeton's interest in Solana, indicating potential institutional support. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is facing potential sell pressure due to large transfers to Binance, and Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amidst global regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical signals, the recent Bybit hack has created significant downward pressure and uncertainty, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum has been heavily impacted by the Bybit incident, with regulatory concerns adding to the negative sentiment. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current environment.

SOL: +0.2 — Institutional interest via the Franklin Templeton ETF filing provides a positive outlook, although recent network issues suggest a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential sell pressure, but without current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the current market turbulence and increased risk aversion, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT as a safe haven is advisable."
2025-02-21 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The market is experiencing a bearish sentiment primarily due to a significant security breach at Bybit, leading to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both seen notable price declines, exacerbated by the hack and subsequent liquidations. Despite this, there are some positive developments, such as Franklin Templeton's interest in Solana through an ETF filing, indicating potential institutional interest.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent Bybit hack has significantly impacted Bitcoin's price and market sentiment, suggesting a cautious approach and potential reduction in exposure.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is also affected by the hack, with additional regulatory concerns. The price breakdown below key levels warrants a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the overall market downturn, institutional interest through the ETF filing provides a slight positive outlook for Solana, justifying a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — The whale transfer to Binance introduces potential sell pressure, but without current holdings, no action is required.

USDT: +0.7 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by the recent $1.5 billion hack at Bybit, which has significantly impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. This event has triggered a sell-off, causing liquidations and heightened volatility across the crypto market. Despite some positive news, such as Coinbase's legal relief and Franklin Templeton's interest in a Solana ETF, the market remains under pressure. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, adds to the cautious sentiment, suggesting a preference for stability and risk aversion.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The Bybit hack has led to a significant drop in Bitcoin's price, and the lack of bullish momentum signals suggests further downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is similarly affected by the Bybit hack, with significant price declines and regulatory concerns. The lack of positive momentum signals supports a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the overall market downturn, the filing for a Solana ETF indicates growing institutional interest, which could provide some support. However, network throughput issues and price pressure warrant a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is potential sell pressure from a large whale transfer, there is no significant change in sentiment or technical indicators to warrant a directional bias.

USDT: +0.7 — In the current risk-averse environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable. The expansion into Africa also suggests a strategic diversification that could enhance stability."
2025-02-21 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, largely driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable declines, exacerbated by the hack's impact on market confidence. Solana, despite some positive news regarding institutional interest, is also under pressure due to network issues. Dogecoin is experiencing potential sell pressure due to large transfers to Binance, while Tether remains stable amidst expanding operations in Africa. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, but the crypto market is currently more influenced by internal events.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The Bybit hack has significantly impacted Bitcoin's price and sentiment, and the market is reacting negatively. Current holdings should be reduced slightly to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum is similarly affected by the Bybit hack, with additional regulatory concerns. A slight reduction in exposure is prudent given the current market conditions.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the ETF filing news, Solana's price is under pressure due to network issues. Maintaining current exposure is advisable until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential sell pressure, but without holding DOGE, no action is necessary.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safer haven and maintains liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-21 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

The current market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable price declines due to the hack, with Bitcoin dropping from around $100k to near $95k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. Solana has also faced pressure, with a decrease in network throughput and price. Despite these challenges, there is some positive news for Solana with Franklin Templeton's ETF filing, indicating institutional interest. Dogecoin is experiencing potential sell pressure due to a large transfer to Binance, while Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amidst global regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent hack at Bybit has caused significant sell pressure and market uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach despite holding BTC.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is under pressure from the Bybit hack and the largest-ever ETH theft, suggesting a need to reduce exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana faces price pressure, the ETF filing by Franklin Templeton signals potential institutional interest, providing a slight positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the large transfer to Binance, there is no clear directional signal, resulting in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.7 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining higher USDT exposure is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-02-21 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily influenced by a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin dropping from around $100k to near $97k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. This incident has overshadowed positive news such as Coinbase's legal victory and Franklin Templeton's Solana ETF filing. The market is also facing increased regulatory scrutiny, particularly following the largest-ever ETH theft. In this environment, risk aversion is heightened, making stablecoins like USDT relatively more attractive as investors seek safety amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent security breach and subsequent sell-off have created a bearish environment for Bitcoin, despite some positive legal news. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from the Bybit hack, with regulatory concerns adding to the negative sentiment. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current environment.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the overall bearish sentiment, the filing of a Solana ETF by Franklin Templeton suggests potential institutional interest, providing a slight positive outlook for SOL.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there are concerns about potential sell pressure from large transfers, there is no significant change in sentiment or technical indicators to warrant a shift in allocation.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by a significant security breach at Bybit, which has caused a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced price declines due to the hack, with Bitcoin dropping from around $100k to near $95k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. This incident has overshadowed positive news, such as Coinbase's legal victory, and has heightened regulatory concerns, particularly for Ethereum. Solana has seen some institutional interest with Franklin Templeton's ETF filing, but its network is under pressure due to reduced throughput and price declines. Dogecoin has experienced some volatility due to large whale movements, while Tether is expanding into African markets amidst global regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent hack has led to significant sell pressure and bearish sentiment, suggesting a cautious approach. Current holdings should be reduced slightly to manage risk.

ETH: -0.4 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum is under pressure from the Bybit hack, with additional regulatory concerns. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current environment.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite network pressure, the ETF filing indicates potential long-term institutional interest, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some volatility due to whale activity, there is no clear directional signal, so maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and helps manage overall portfolio risk."
2025-02-21 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced declines due to the hack, with Bitcoin's price dropping significantly and Ethereum facing its largest-ever theft. Solana, despite some institutional interest, is also under pressure due to network throughput issues and price declines. Dogecoin is experiencing potential sell pressure due to large whale movements, while Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amidst global regulatory challenges. In this environment, risk aversion is prevalent, leading to a cautious approach in asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The Bybit hack has created significant downward pressure on Bitcoin, and the lack of bullish technical signals suggests reducing exposure to manage risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit incident, with additional regulatory concerns. The absence of positive technical indicators supports a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the negative market sentiment, the filing for a Solana ETF indicates potential institutional interest, providing a slightly positive outlook compared to other assets.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is potential sell pressure from whale activity, there are no strong technical or fundamental indicators to warrant a directional change.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage volatility."
2025-02-22 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing potential for a breakout due to institutional interest and supply constraints, respectively. Bitcoin's price has been stable, with analysts predicting a potential breakout, while Ethereum has seen a price increase following a significant hack at Bybit, leading to a supply squeeze. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum driven by significant whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculative bullish predictions, though these are highly speculative. The macroeconomic environment, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, supports a balanced risk approach, while the U.S. dollar index remains strong, suggesting some caution in riskier assets. Tether's involvement in freezing illicit funds highlights its role in maintaining market integrity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and a potential breakout signal a positive outlook, though technical indicators remain neutral.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze following the Bybit hack and subsequent buyback supports a bullish stance, despite neutral technical indicators.

SOL: +0.7 — Whale accumulation and staking activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

DOGE: +0.3 — While speculative, the bullish sentiment and recent price increases suggest a moderate positive outlook.

USDT: 0.0 — With the current market showing signs of cautious optimism, maintaining a neutral position in USDT allows for flexibility in reallocating capital as conditions evolve."
2025-02-22 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of potential breakouts due to institutional interest and supply constraints, respectively. Bitcoin's sideways trading is seen as healthy, with analysts predicting a possible breakout. Ethereum's recent price increase is driven by a supply squeeze following a significant hack and subsequent market stabilization efforts by Bybit. Solana has experienced bullish momentum due to whale accumulation and staking, while Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative optimism. In contrast, Tether remains stable, with its involvement in freezing illicit funds highlighting its role in market security.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a moderately bullish outlook. The market is showing signs of a potential upward movement, making BTC relatively attractive.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and market stabilization efforts post-Bybit hack have created a bullish environment for ETH, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and staking have provided a positive momentum boost, though the broader market context suggests a more cautious approach compared to BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative optimism, the lack of substantial technical or on-chain signals keeps DOGE in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and potential bullish movements in other assets, reducing USDT exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-02-22 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of cautious optimism and underlying volatility. Bitcoin is showing signs of potential breakout due to institutional interest and a tightening price range, although technical indicators remain neutral. Ethereum's recent price increase is driven by a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit's buyback efforts providing additional support. Solana has experienced a price lift due to significant whale accumulation, suggesting bullish sentiment. Dogecoin's speculative projections are capturing attention, but the lack of substantial technical or on-chain support tempers enthusiasm. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by recent security measures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and potential breakout signals suggest moderate bullishness, although technical indicators remain neutral.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and Bybit's buyback efforts create a favorable short-term environment for price appreciation.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking activities indicate positive sentiment and potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish projections, there is insufficient technical or on-chain support to justify increased exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With moderate bullish signals in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a relatively stable U.S. dollar, moderate volatility, and high gold prices, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish sentiment in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin remains in a tight trading range, with potential for a breakout as institutional interest grows. Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze due to recent market events, which could drive short-term price increases. Solana has seen positive momentum from significant whale activity, while Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative bullish predictions. Tether's proactive measures in response to security incidents highlight its role as a stable asset in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and potential for a breakout provide a moderately bullish outlook, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and market stabilization efforts post-Bybit hack create a favorable environment for ETH appreciation.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking activities indicate positive sentiment and potential for further price increases.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish predictions, there is no substantial data-driven momentum to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-02-22 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin's price has been stable, with institutional support suggesting potential for future gains, although technical indicators do not yet signal a breakout. Ethereum has seen a price boost due to a supply squeeze following the Bybit hack, with additional support from Bybit's market-stabilizing actions. Solana's recent whale activity has provided a modest price lift, reinforcing a bullish outlook. Dogecoin's speculative projections have captured attention, but the lack of technical signals tempers enthusiasm. Tether remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its response to the Bybit hack.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential for a breakout suggest moderate bullishness, though technical indicators remain neutral.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and market stabilization efforts post-Bybit hack provide a short-term bullish outlook, despite neutral technical signals.

SOL: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and staking activity offer a positive sentiment boost, but technical indicators remain neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish projections, technical signals do not support a strong directional move.

USDT: -0.4 — With a slight bullish sentiment in the market, there is a moderate preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2025-02-22 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with signs of potential bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing a tightening price range, suggesting an imminent breakout, supported by growing institutional interest. Ethereum has seen a price uptick due to a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit actively buying back ETH to stabilize the market. Solana has gained positive momentum from a whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative bullish predictions, though these are highly speculative. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with some activity related to freezing funds tied to illicit activities, reflecting its role in maintaining market integrity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a moderate increase in allocation, but the absence of a clear technical buy signal tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and active buyback by Bybit provide a strong short-term bullish case, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking reinforce bullish sentiment, though technical indicators remain neutral.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative optimism provides a slight positive bias, but the lack of concrete data-driven signals limits the score.

USDT: -0.3 — With the potential for bullish moves in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly in favor of risk assets seems prudent."
2025-02-22 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish undertone. Bitcoin is experiencing a narrowing trading range, suggesting a potential breakout, supported by increasing institutional interest. Ethereum has seen a price lift due to a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit actively buying back ETH to stabilize the market. Solana has witnessed a whale accumulation, which has bolstered its price and momentum. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative bullish predictions, though these remain highly speculative. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but is playing a crucial role in market stabilization efforts post-hack.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a moderate bullish outlook, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and active buyback efforts post-hack provide a strong bullish signal, justifying a higher allocation.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking have reinforced bullish momentum, making it attractive for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While speculative, the bullish sentiment and price predictions provide a slight positive signal, though caution is advised.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards riskier assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment in traditional markets, which may spill over into crypto markets. Bitcoin's price has been consolidating, with institutional support and a potential breakout on the horizon. Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze due to a recent hack, which has led to a short-term price recovery. Solana has seen significant whale accumulation, reinforcing bullish momentum. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative bullish predictions, while Tether remains stable with active measures against illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a favorable outlook. Despite the lack of a strong technical buy signal, the overall sentiment is positive.

ETH: +0.5 — The supply squeeze and buyback efforts post-Bybit hack have created a short-term bullish environment, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Whale accumulation and staking activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making it a highly attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While speculative, the positive sentiment and bullish predictions provide a slight upward bias, warranting a cautious increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive signals across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2025-02-22 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of potential upward movement due to institutional interest and recent events impacting supply dynamics. Bitcoin's narrowing trading range suggests a possible breakout, while Ethereum's recent price increase is supported by a supply squeeze following the Bybit hack. Solana has experienced positive momentum due to significant whale accumulation, reinforcing its bullish outlook. Dogecoin, while buoyed by speculative predictions, lacks substantial fundamental support for such projections. Meanwhile, Tether's stability and active measures against illicit activities maintain its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a moderate increase in allocation, despite the current lack of a clear trend signal.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and OTC buyback by Bybit provide strong short-term bullish momentum, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking activities have reinforced bullish momentum, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish predictions, there is no substantial data or sentiment shift to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and potential bullish movements in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2025-02-22 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

Overall, the crypto market is showing signs of bullish momentum, with several assets experiencing positive developments. Bitcoin is seeing increased institutional interest, which is supporting a bullish narrative despite its current sideways trading pattern. Ethereum has been positively impacted by a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit's buyback efforts further stabilizing the market. Solana is benefiting from whale accumulation and staking activities, reinforcing its bullish momentum. Dogecoin is experiencing speculative optimism, although the projections are highly speculative. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its involvement in freezing illicit funds demonstrating its role in maintaining market integrity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a positive outlook, warranting increased exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — The supply squeeze and buyback activities have created a favorable environment for price appreciation, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Whale accumulation and staking activities are driving bullish momentum, making it a strong candidate for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While speculative optimism exists, the lack of substantial data-driven support keeps the score modestly positive.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the overall bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable."
2025-02-22 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a narrowing price range, suggesting a potential breakout, supported by growing institutional interest. Ethereum has seen a slight price increase due to a supply squeeze following a major hack, with Bybit's buyback efforts further stabilizing the market. Solana is benefiting from significant whale accumulation and staking activity, reinforcing its bullish momentum. Dogecoin has speculative bullish projections but lacks substantial market activity to support a strong move. Meanwhile, Tether remains a stable choice amidst market fluctuations, with its involvement in freezing illicit funds showcasing its role in maintaining market integrity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional support and the potential for a breakout make Bitcoin attractive, despite the lack of a clear trend signal.

ETH: +0.4 — The supply squeeze and Bybit's buyback efforts provide short-term bullish momentum, though technicals remain neutral.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking activity indicate strong bullish sentiment, supporting a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish projections, there is insufficient market activity to justify a directional move.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains."

Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin's price is showing signs of a potential breakout, supported by institutional interest and a tightening trading range. Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze due to the Bybit hack, which has led to a short-term price recovery. Solana is benefiting from significant whale accumulation and staking, further boosting its bullish momentum. Dogecoin has speculative bullish predictions, but these are largely based on historical trends rather than current fundamentals. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its actions to freeze funds linked to the Bybit hack.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The potential for a breakout and institutional support provides a positive outlook, though the current technicals are not yet confirming a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and market stabilization efforts post-Bybit hack create a favorable environment for price appreciation, supported by bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.7 — Whale accumulation and staking are strong bullish indicators, suggesting continued price growth and positive sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish predictions, there is no substantial data or news to support a strong directional move at this time.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullish momentum, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2025-02-22 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Institutional support and potential breakouts are driving positive sentiment for Bitcoin, while Ethereum benefits from a supply squeeze and strategic buybacks following a security breach. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum due to significant whale accumulation and staking activities. Dogecoin remains speculative with optimistic projections, though lacking substantial data-driven support. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, suggesting a balanced risk appetite. Tether's active measures against illicit funds highlight its role as a stable asset in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional support and narrowing price range hint at a potential breakout, supported by bullish momentum indicators.

ETH: +0.5 — Positive price movement driven by a supply squeeze and strategic buybacks, alongside bullish technical signals.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking reinforce bullish momentum, with technical indicators supporting further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite optimistic projections, there is insufficient data-driven support to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, though USDT remains a safe haven in volatile conditions."
2025-02-22 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a cautiously optimistic sentiment, with bullish momentum signals across most major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a narrowing price range, hinting at a potential breakout, supported by growing institutional interest. Ethereum is seeing a supply squeeze due to recent events, which has driven short-term price recovery. Solana's recent whale accumulation and staking activity have reinforced its bullish momentum. Dogecoin, while speculative, has seen some positive sentiment from analysts. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its role as a safe haven emphasized by its involvement in freezing illicit funds related to the Bybit hack.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — The supply squeeze and market stabilization efforts post-Bybit hack support a positive short-term outlook for Ethereum.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking activity have strengthened Solana's bullish momentum, making it an attractive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some speculative bullish predictions, there is no substantial change in data or sentiment to justify a directional move.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-02-22 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong whale accumulation and staking activity reinforce bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While speculative predictions are driving interest, the lack of concrete developments suggests a cautious but positive stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing bullish sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, there is a moderate shift away from stablecoins as risk appetite grows."
2025-02-22 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum and positive news developments. Bitcoin is experiencing a narrowing trading range, suggesting a potential breakout, bolstered by institutional support. Ethereum's price has been positively impacted by a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit's buyback efforts further stabilizing the market. Solana has seen a price lift due to significant whale accumulation and staking activity, reinforcing bullish momentum. Dogecoin is benefiting from speculative bullish predictions, although these remain highly speculative. Meanwhile, Tether's active measures against illicit funds highlight its role as a stable and vigilant asset in the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a favorable outlook, despite the current sideways trading pattern.

ETH: +0.8 — The supply squeeze and Bybit's buyback efforts have created a strong bullish environment, with technical indicators also supporting upward momentum.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking activity have reinforced bullish momentum, making Solana an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While speculative predictions are driving some optimism, the lack of substantial technical or on-chain changes suggests a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — In a bullish market environment, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on growth opportunities in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Institutional support and narrowing price ranges suggest potential breakouts for BTC, while ETH is experiencing a supply squeeze due to recent events, which is driving its price upward. SOL's price is buoyed by significant whale activity, indicating strong market confidence. DOGE shows speculative optimism, but lacks substantial data-driven momentum. USDT remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its involvement in the Bybit hack incident.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional adoption and a potential breakout from a narrowing price range suggest a favorable outlook for BTC, supported by positive on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.8 — The supply squeeze and market stabilization efforts post-Bybit hack create a strong bullish environment for ETH, with technical indicators also supporting upward momentum.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking activity reinforce bullish momentum, coupled with consistent positive technical signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative optimism, DOGE lacks strong data-driven momentum, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is prudent to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-02-22 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Institutional interest and technical indicators suggest potential upward momentum for Bitcoin, while Ethereum's price has been positively impacted by the Bybit hack, which effectively reduced circulating supply and prompted a buyback. Solana also shows strong bullish momentum due to significant whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin is experiencing speculative optimism, although the projections are highly ambitious. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its involvement in freezing funds linked to the Bybit hack.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional support and technical indicators suggest a potential breakout, making BTC an attractive asset to increase exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and buyback following the Bybit hack create a favorable environment for ETH, supporting a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking reinforce bullish momentum, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While speculative projections are ambitious, the current bullish sentiment justifies a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-02-22 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a narrowing price range, hinting at a potential breakout, supported by growing institutional interest. Ethereum's price has been buoyed by a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit's efforts to stabilize the market further supporting its price. Solana has seen positive momentum due to significant whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin is experiencing speculative optimism, though its price movements remain relatively stable. Meanwhile, Tether's involvement in freezing illicit funds highlights its role in maintaining market integrity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a moderate increase in allocation, though the market remains in a consolidation phase.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and Bybit's market-stabilizing actions create a favorable environment for price appreciation, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking activity provide a bullish signal, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative optimism, there are no substantial changes in data or sentiment to justify altering the current position.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential upward movements in the market."
2025-02-22 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin's sideways trading and institutional support suggest a potential breakout, while Ethereum's supply squeeze post-Bybit hack has driven short-term price recovery. Solana's price is buoyed by significant whale accumulation, reinforcing its bullish momentum. Meanwhile, Dogecoin's speculative projections are generating interest, though they remain highly speculative. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a risk-on environment, but the presence of stablecoin activity indicates some market caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Strong institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, supported by bullish technical indicators.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility due to the Bybit hack, Ethereum's price recovery and bullish momentum signals make it attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.7 — Whale accumulation and staking activity reinforce positive sentiment and price momentum, making Solana a strong candidate for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While speculative, the positive sentiment and bullish price predictions provide a moderate buy signal, though caution is warranted given its speculative nature.

USDT: -0.3 — With the overall market showing bullish tendencies, there's a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Institutional interest in Bitcoin and a narrowing price range suggest potential for a breakout, while Ethereum is recovering from a supply squeeze due to the Bybit hack. Solana's price is buoyed by significant whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin's sentiment is bolstered by speculative bullish projections, though these remain highly speculative. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its involvement in freezing funds linked to illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and a potential breakout signal make BTC attractive. Its sideways trading is seen as healthy, indicating resilience and potential for upward movement.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and Bybit's buyback efforts have created a bullish environment for ETH, suggesting potential for further price recovery.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking have reinforced bullish momentum, making SOL a favorable asset in the current market conditions.

DOGE: +0.3 — While speculative projections are driving sentiment, the lack of substantial on-chain activity tempers the enthusiasm, though it remains a positive asset.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."
2025-02-22 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing a tightening price range, suggesting a potential breakout, supported by institutional interest. Ethereum's market is reacting to a supply squeeze following the Bybit hack, with a buyback effort stabilizing prices. Solana benefits from significant whale accumulation, reinforcing its bullish momentum. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative bullish projections, although these remain highly speculative. Meanwhile, USDT's role as a stablecoin remains crucial, especially with its involvement in freezing illicit funds, but the market's risk appetite seems to be increasing, potentially reducing its relative attractiveness.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's potential breakout and institutional support provide a strong bullish case, supported by positive technical indicators and on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and buyback efforts post-Bybit hack create a favorable short-term environment, with bullish technical signals reinforcing this sentiment.

SOL: +0.7 — Whale accumulation and staking activity bolster Solana's bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — While speculative projections are overly optimistic, the overall positive sentiment and bullish technical indicators justify a moderate buy signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin exposure in favor of higher-return opportunities."
2025-02-22 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a bullish tilt. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing signs of potential breakouts, supported by institutional interest and recent market events like the Bybit hack, which has temporarily reduced ETH supply. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum due to significant whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin has speculative bullish sentiment based on historical trends, though the projections are highly speculative. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its involvement in freezing illicit funds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum with institutional support and potential for a breakout, making it a favorable asset to increase exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — The recent supply squeeze and buyback by Bybit have bolstered ETH's price, suggesting a positive outlook despite the hack-related volatility.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking have reinforced bullish momentum, making Solana an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While speculative sentiment is high, the lack of substantial data-driven momentum keeps the score modestly positive.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals across other assets, reducing exposure to USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2025-02-22 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Institutional interest in Bitcoin and a potential breakout from its current trading range suggest a positive outlook. Ethereum has seen a supply squeeze due to a recent hack, which has temporarily increased its price. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum due to significant whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin's sentiment is speculative, with some analysts projecting significant price increases, although these are largely based on historical trends rather than current fundamentals. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its involvement in freezing illicit funds related to a recent hack.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and potential for a breakout from a tightening price range provide a bullish outlook, supported by positive on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.6 — The recent supply squeeze and buyback activity post-hack have bolstered short-term bullish sentiment, making ETH attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking reinforce bullish momentum, suggesting a positive outlook for price appreciation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish predictions, there is no substantial data or news to support a significant change in allocation at this time.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall bullish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH showing strong technical indicators and positive news. Bitcoin's price is supported by significant corporate accumulation from MicroStrategy, which enhances its bullish outlook. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, reinforcing its momentum. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news but exhibit stable technical indicators. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, which supports risk-on sentiment. However, the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could temper some of the bullishness. USDT's breakout above the upper Bollinger Band suggests potential capital inflow into stablecoins, possibly as a hedge against volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and significant corporate accumulation news. The bullish momentum is supported by increased on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical setup and positive momentum indicators. Although no major news, the technicals suggest continued upward potential.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the lack of significant news, the technical indicators remain generally positive, though slightly weaker than BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators. The asset remains stable with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.4 — Despite a potential breakout, the overall market sentiment leans towards risk-on, suggesting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on bullish trends in other assets."
2025-02-23 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with key cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum maintaining upward momentum, supported by positive technical indicators and significant corporate accumulation, particularly in Bitcoin. Despite slight price fluctuations, the macroeconomic context remains relatively stable, with no drastic changes in major indices or commodities. The absence of significant news for Solana, Dogecoin, and Tether suggests a lack of immediate catalysts for these assets, while the general market environment favors risk-on behavior, albeit with some caution due to the stable macroeconomic backdrop.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong buy signals, supported by MicroStrategy's significant purchase, indicate robust institutional interest and bullish momentum, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and stable trading above key moving averages suggest continued positive momentum, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a lack of significant news and mixed technical signals, Solana's price stability suggests maintaining current exposure without adjustments.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral, warranting a hold position.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2025-02-23 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin showing strong accumulation by institutional investors like MicroStrategy, which is a positive sign for BTC. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, suggesting continued upward momentum. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana's technical indicators suggest potential weakness. USDT remains a stable option, but in a market with bullish signals for BTC and ETH, capital may rotate out of stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional accumulation and bullish technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, making it a priority for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical setup and positive momentum make Ethereum attractive, though slightly less so than Bitcoin due to less impactful news.

SOL: -0.2 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical signals suggest caution; consider reducing exposure slightly if held.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the absence of significant news and slight price decreases suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With bullish signals in BTC and ETH, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as investors seek higher returns in risk assets."
2025-02-23 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment. In the crypto market, Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum, supported by significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy, which has bolstered confidence in BTC. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, although recent price action has been somewhat mixed. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, with Solana showing signs of a potential breakdown, while Dogecoin maintains bullish momentum despite no major news. USDT remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, but its allocation may be reduced in favor of riskier assets given the current market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy support a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. 

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed recent price action, Ethereum's bullish technical setup and overall market sentiment remain positive, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Lack of significant news and technical indicators suggesting a potential breakdown make Solana less attractive at the moment. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is no significant news, Dogecoin's technical indicators remain bullish, suggesting a modest increase in allocation could be beneficial.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment in riskier assets and strong signals from BTC and ETH, reducing exposure to USDT to allocate capital towards these assets is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of bullish momentum, supported by positive technical indicators and significant corporate accumulation in Bitcoin by MicroStrategy. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, reinforcing its upward potential. However, Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news catalysts and exhibit mixed technical signals, indicating a more neutral stance. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, suggests a balanced risk environment, encouraging some capital allocation into riskier assets while maintaining a safety net in stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from technical indicators and significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy suggest robust upward momentum, making BTC highly attractive.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish technical setup and stable price action support a positive outlook, though less aggressive than BTC due to slightly mixed momentum signals.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding current positions without increasing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some activity surges, the absence of significant news or strong technical signals results in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to allocate more capital towards these assets, reflecting increased risk appetite."
2025-02-23 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by a VIX of 18.72. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which could exert pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen significant corporate accumulation, with MicroStrategy's large purchase potentially supporting its price. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, suggesting continued investor interest. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, while Tether remains stable. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing potential for upward movement, while Solana and Dogecoin remain neutral due to lack of strong signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The substantial purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional confidence, and technical indicators show bullish momentum, making BTC attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed momentum signals, Ethereum's bullish technical setup and price stability above key moving averages suggest a positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana does not present a compelling case for increased allocation at this time.

DOGE: -0.1 — While there is some bullish momentum, the lack of significant news and mixed technical signals warrant a cautious approach, slightly reducing exposure.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the positive sentiment in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in risk assets."
2025-02-23 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 18.72. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which can exert downward pressure on crypto assets. Bitcoin has seen significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy, which is a bullish signal for BTC. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, suggesting potential upward movement. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, and their technical indicators do not show strong bullish signals. USDT remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, but its continued bullish momentum suggests some investors are still seeking safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strong corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy and bullish on-chain activity support a positive outlook for BTC, despite the lack of a short-term buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and recent price increases suggest a favorable environment for ETH, though the absence of a strong momentum signal tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, SOL does not present a compelling case for increased allocation at this time.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the lack of significant news and mixed technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish signals for BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to reallocate capital towards these more promising assets."
2025-02-23 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a relatively stable U.S. Dollar Index and a high S&P 500, indicating a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing significant corporate accumulation, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's large purchase, which supports a bullish outlook despite mixed technical signals. Ethereum is maintaining a bullish technical setup with strong price momentum, suggesting a favorable environment for further gains. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news but show stable on-chain activity and slight price increases. Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst these dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite mixed technical signals, the substantial corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy suggests strong institutional confidence, warranting a positive allocation score.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and significant price increase indicate strong momentum, making it highly attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — While lacking significant news, Solana's stable price and on-chain activity suggest a neutral to slightly positive outlook, warranting a modest allocation increase.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral, with no compelling reason to adjust the current allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 18.72. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong at 106.6, which could exert some pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent price action is characterized by a lack of clear upward momentum, despite MicroStrategy's significant purchase, which suggests a potential for future bullish sentiment. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by positive price momentum and technical indicators. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news, with their price movements largely following broader market trends. Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the absence of a clear technical buy signal, MicroStrategy's large acquisition indicates strong institutional interest, suggesting potential for future price appreciation.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum exhibits strong bullish momentum both technically and fundamentally, with price action supported by positive news and technical indicators.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, Solana remains neutral, reflecting its alignment with broader market movements without a clear directional bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows no significant news or technical signals, resulting in a neutral stance as it lacks a clear catalyst for movement.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment in ETH and BTC, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capture potential upside in riskier assets."
2025-02-23 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with some bullish signals, particularly for Ethereum, which maintains a strong technical setup and momentum. Bitcoin has seen significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy, which could provide a bullish underpinning, although its technical indicators remain neutral. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, and their technical indicators are mostly neutral, with slight bullish momentum for Solana. The macroeconomic context, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, suggests a cautious but not overly bearish market environment. Given this backdrop, maintaining a balanced portfolio with a slight tilt towards assets with stronger momentum and technical setups seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The significant acquisition by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, which could support price stability and potential upward movement despite neutral technical indicators.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum and technical signals, supported by positive news, making it the most attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — While lacking significant news, Solana shows slight bullish momentum and stable on-chain activity, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral with no clear signal for capital reallocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the relatively bullish sentiment for Ethereum and Bitcoin, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential upward movements in these assets."
2025-02-23 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Solana and Dogecoin have shown no significant news-driven catalysts, and their market data reflects a lack of strong directional signals. Tether remains stable, as expected, with no major news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The significant purchase by MicroStrategy is a strong bullish signal, coupled with bullish momentum indicators, suggesting further upside potential.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and positive momentum indicators support a favorable outlook, warranting increased allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, Solana remains neutral, suggesting a hold position.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the lack of significant news or technical breakthroughs keeps Dogecoin in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in BTC and ETH, there's a rationale to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of higher-risk assets with potential upside."
2025-02-23 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 18.72. The U.S. dollar index is strong at 106.6, which might exert some pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent price action suggests a potential breakdown, as it trades below the lower Bollinger Band, despite bullish momentum from a significant purchase by MicroStrategy. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by positive momentum indicators. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news or strong technical signals, while USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite trading below the lower Bollinger Band, the large acquisition by MicroStrategy suggests confidence in BTC's long-term value, warranting a cautious buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish momentum and technical setup, combined with its resilience above key moving averages, make it an attractive option for capital allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, Solana remains neutral in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.2 — While USDT provides stability, the current market conditions and potential bullish signals in other assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index. Bitcoin's recent price action shows a potential breakdown, despite MicroStrategy's significant purchase, which could provide a longer-term bullish signal. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by strong on-chain activity and positive momentum indicators. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, with Solana showing signs of a potential breakdown in price, while Dogecoin maintains bullish momentum despite low activity. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While BTC is experiencing a short-term price breakdown, the significant purchase by MicroStrategy suggests potential for a longer-term bullish trend. Maintain a cautious positive stance.

ETH: +0.7 — Strong technical indicators and bullish momentum make ETH attractive, supported by consistent on-chain activity and positive news sentiment.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, as the asset is currently experiencing a price breakdown.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite low on-chain activity, DOGE maintains bullish momentum, warranting a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the potential for bullish trends in BTC and ETH, reduce exposure to USDT to allocate more capital towards these assets, reflecting a moderate risk appetite."
2025-02-23 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight recovery in price after a recent dip, supported by significant corporate accumulation from MicroStrategy, which could indicate long-term confidence in BTC. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, with its price holding above key moving averages, suggesting continued positive momentum. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news but show no clear bullish signals from recent market data. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively stable S&P 500 and moderate volatility, suggests a cautiously optimistic market sentiment, though the high U.S. dollar index may exert some pressure on crypto assets. In this environment, USDT remains a safe haven, though its allocation may decrease if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, significant accumulation by MicroStrategy and a slight recovery in price suggest potential for upward movement.

ETH: +0.8 — Strong bullish technical signals and price resilience above key moving averages indicate a favorable outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding the current position without changes.

DOGE: -0.2 — Low on-chain activity and lack of significant news suggest reducing exposure slightly, but only if currently held.

USDT: -0.3 — While remaining a safe option, a slight reduction is warranted to allocate more capital to ETH and BTC, given the potential for upward movement in these assets."
2025-02-23 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight downward trend, with no significant bullish technical indicators, despite MicroStrategy's substantial purchase, which suggests confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by positive momentum indicators and trading above key moving averages. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, and their technical indicators do not suggest strong momentum in either direction. The macroeconomic context is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which may influence a cautious approach to risk assets. The stablecoin USDT remains neutral, with no significant market movements or news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish signals, MicroStrategy's large acquisition indicates strong institutional confidence, warranting a modest positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Consistent bullish technical indicators and positive news reinforce Ethereum's upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana remains a hold, reflecting a lack of clear directional bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — The absence of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure without adjustment.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the slightly positive sentiment in risk assets like ETH and BTC, a small reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential upside in other assets."

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context suggests a mixed environment with relatively high interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, which can be challenging for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 is at a high level, indicating some risk appetite in traditional markets, but the elevated VIX suggests caution. In the crypto market, Bitcoin's recent price action shows potential weakness with a breakdown below the Bollinger Bands, despite MicroStrategy's significant purchase, which might provide some support. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by positive news, while Solana and Dogecoin show signs of potential breakdowns with no significant news to counteract the negative sentiment. Tether remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, with no significant market-moving news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.2** — Despite the recent price breakdown, MicroStrategy's large purchase indicates strong institutional support, which could stabilize the price and provide a slight bullish bias.

**ETH: +0.5** — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and positive news reinforce its attractiveness, making it a preferred asset for capital allocation in the current environment.

**SOL: 0.0** — With no significant news and technical indicators showing potential weakness, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent until clearer signals emerge.

**DOGE: -0.1** — Given the significant price decrease and lack of supportive news, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted, although the overall impact is limited by the small position size.

**USDT: +0.3** — In light of the mixed signals across other assets and potential market volatility, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer and flexibility for future opportunities."
2025-02-23 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment presents a mixed sentiment with some bullish signals for Ethereum, as it maintains a positive technical setup and continues to trade above key moving averages. Bitcoin has seen significant corporate accumulation, with MicroStrategy's large purchase potentially providing a bullish underpinning. However, Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest caution, as it trades below key moving averages and shows no bullish momentum. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news catalysts and exhibit bearish technical signals, with both assets trading below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and stable gold prices, suggests a cautious risk environment, which may favor holding stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the significant acquisition by MicroStrategy suggests potential for future upward momentum. However, caution is warranted due to current technical weakness.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and positive news reinforce its attractiveness. It remains a strong candidate for capital allocation given its resilience above key moving averages.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators suggest a cautious stance. The asset is trading below its lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside.

DOGE: -0.1 — With no significant news and bearish technical signals, Dogecoin shows limited upside potential. It remains a hold, but with a slight bias towards reducing exposure if held.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for further downside in risk assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against volatility and preserves capital for future opportunities."
2025-02-23 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong, which can exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a slight recovery in the last hour, but overall, it remains under pressure with technical indicators suggesting potential breakdowns. Ethereum, on the other hand, shows a more bullish technical setup, supported by recent news of maintaining key levels. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news catalysts and show mixed technical signals, while USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite a potential breakdown, the recent large acquisition by MicroStrategy suggests strong institutional interest, which could support prices in the medium term.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical setup and recent price resilience make Ethereum attractive, especially with the absence of negative news.

SOL: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to suggest a strong directional move; maintain current exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and technical signals keeps Dogecoin neutral; no immediate action warranted.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the slight bullish sentiment in ETH and BTC, a small reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential upward movements in these assets."
2025-02-23 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Ethereum showing a bullish technical setup and Bitcoin experiencing significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy. Despite these positive signals, technical indicators for most assets remain bearish or neutral, with many trading below key moving averages and showing no strong momentum. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by high interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious approach. The lack of significant news for Solana, Dogecoin, and Tether indicates no immediate catalysts for these assets, while the volatility index remains moderate, suggesting a stable but uncertain market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The substantial Bitcoin purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional support, which could drive prices higher despite current bearish technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and sustained activity surge support a positive outlook, although the lack of momentum signals tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and bearish technical indicators, Solana remains neutral. The lack of a clear catalyst suggests holding current positions.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin shows no bullish technical indicators and low on-chain activity, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure is prudent given current holdings.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of mixed signals across other assets and a strong macroeconomic backdrop, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against potential volatility."

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with a slight bullish bias for Ethereum, supported by its technical setup and recent price stability above key moving averages. Bitcoin has seen significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy, which could provide a bullish underpinning, although technical indicators remain neutral. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news catalysts and exhibit no strong technical signals, suggesting a neutral stance. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a stable U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, do not indicate any immediate risk-off sentiment, allowing for a cautious but slightly risk-on approach. The stablecoin USDT remains a safe haven, but in the absence of strong bearish signals, capital rotation into more volatile assets might be considered.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The significant purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, potentially supporting price stability and upward momentum despite neutral technicals.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and consistent trading above key moving averages make it an attractive asset for capital allocation, supported by positive sentiment.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana does not currently warrant a change in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and technical signals suggests maintaining current exposure without adjustment.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the slight bullish sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital into more volatile assets seems prudent, while still maintaining a safety buffer."
2025-02-23 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed backdrop for crypto assets. The 10-Year Treasury Yield is relatively high, which could exert pressure on risk assets, while the S&P 500 is at elevated levels, suggesting some market optimism. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, potentially impacting crypto negatively. Gold's high price indicates a flight to safety, which might suggest caution in risk markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin sees significant institutional interest with MicroStrategy's substantial purchase, which could bolster confidence in BTC. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, though its MACD signals remain neutral. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, and their technical indicators do not suggest strong momentum. USDT remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, but its role as a safe haven might be less appealing if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — The significant acquisition by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional confidence, which, combined with increased on-chain activity, suggests a positive outlook for BTC.

**ETH: +0.5** — Despite neutral momentum signals, the bullish technical setup and consistent transaction activity support a moderately positive stance.

**SOL: 0.0** — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana does not present a compelling case for capital reallocation at this time.

**DOGE: -0.2** — Given the lack of significant news and low on-chain activity, a slight reduction in exposure is warranted to reallocate capital to assets with stronger signals.

**USDT: -0.5** — With increased risk appetite and positive signals in BTC and ETH, reducing stablecoin holdings to fund these opportunities is advisable."
2025-02-23 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable market with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 18.72. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong at 106.6, which could impact crypto assets negatively due to their inverse relationship. Bitcoin's recent acquisition by MicroStrategy highlights strong institutional interest, which is a positive signal for BTC. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, suggesting potential upward movement. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, indicating a neutral stance. Overall, the market shows mixed signals with some bullish sentiment for BTC and ETH, while other assets remain neutral.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional buying by MicroStrategy signals strong confidence in BTC, despite mixed technical indicators. The overall market sentiment is slightly bullish.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's technical setup remains bullish, supported by its price holding above key moving averages, indicating potential for upward movement.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest no strong directional bias for Solana at this time.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment for BTC and ETH, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to take advantage of potential gains in these assets."
2025-02-23 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed picture with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, suggesting a cautious but not overly bearish market sentiment. Bitcoin has seen significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy, which could signal confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, reinforcing positive sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, while Tether remains stable as expected for a stablecoin. Overall, the market shows signs of cautious optimism, with Bitcoin and Ethereum appearing more attractive due to recent developments and technical indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The significant purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional confidence, and recent bullish momentum suggests potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.6 — The bullish technical setup and consistent buy signals provide a positive outlook, although the lack of momentum signal tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana remains a hold as there are no clear signals to increase or decrease exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Low on-chain activity and lack of news suggest reducing exposure slightly, especially given the current holdings.

USDT: -0.4 — In light of the positive sentiment towards BTC and ETH, reducing stablecoin holdings to allocate more capital towards these potentially higher-return assets is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by relatively stable interest rates and a moderate level of market volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong, which can sometimes exert downward pressure on crypto assets. Bitcoin has seen significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy, which is a bullish signal. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, suggesting potential for upward movement. Solana and Dogecoin have no significant news, and their technical indicators show no strong buy signals. Tether remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The substantial purchase by MicroStrategy is a strong bullish signal, indicating confidence in Bitcoin's long-term value. Despite the lack of short-term technical buy signals, the corporate accumulation suggests potential for upward momentum.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and its ability to hold above key moving averages support a positive outlook. While MACD is not currently bullish, the overall sentiment remains favorable.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana does not present a compelling case for either buying or selling. Maintaining current exposure is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows low on-chain activity and lacks significant news or technical signals to drive a change in allocation. Holding the current position is appropriate.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish signals for BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to reallocate capital towards these assets, reflecting a moderate increase in risk appetite."
2025-02-24 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries

- **Altcoin sell-off drags ETH lower** – In a market-wide downturn, poor sentiment hit altcoins hard, pushing Ether down by over 8% on continuing bearish macro cues.

**Solana (SOL)**

- **Plunges below $150 to yearly low** – SOL tumbled past $150, marking its weakest price of the year amid a broader crypto sell-off.
- **Slides under $160 after weekend hack fallout** – Solana dropped below $160, losing over 7% intraday following the blanket impact of the ByBit incident.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown resilience compared to altcoins, with institutional interest providing some support despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum is under significant pressure due to a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price. Solana has also experienced a substantial drop, reaching a yearly low, exacerbated by the broader market downturn. Dogecoin, however, remains buoyant with speculative optimism about a potential massive price surge. In this environment, USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals and relative resilience compared to altcoins suggest a moderate buy opportunity.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the ByBit hack and broader altcoin sell-off create a challenging environment for ETH, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — With SOL hitting a yearly low and lacking positive momentum, a slight reduction in holdings is prudent given the current bearish conditions.

DOGE: +0.1 — Speculative sentiment around a potential price surge provides a slight positive bias, but caution is warranted due to overall market weakness.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-24 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown resilience compared to altcoins, with institutional interest potentially providing support despite its recent dip. Ethereum is facing significant downward pressure due to a major hack, which has also adversely affected Solana, driving it to yearly lows. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with speculative bullish projections, but lacks immediate catalysts. The overall market is experiencing a risk-off environment, with stablecoins like USDT maintaining their value amidst the volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, institutional accumulation and relative strength compared to altcoins suggest a mild preference for increasing BTC exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the ByBit hack and broader altcoin sell-off creates a cautious outlook for ETH, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price declines and negative sentiment following the hack suggest reducing SOL holdings to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative projections are bullish, the lack of immediate positive catalysts and low activity suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.4 — In a risk-off environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides stability and liquidity amidst market uncertainty."
2025-02-24 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown relative resilience compared to altcoins, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a price dip below $94K. Ethereum and Solana have been significantly impacted by a major hack, with Ethereum experiencing a sharp decline due to the theft of $1.5B in ETH. Solana has reached its lowest price of the year, exacerbated by the same incident. Dogecoin, while also declining, has some speculative bullish sentiment from analysts predicting a potential surge. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent dip, Bitcoin's resilience and signs of institutional accumulation suggest a moderate buy signal. It remains a relatively safer asset amid current market conditions.

ETH: -0.3 — The recent hack and subsequent price decline, along with bearish sentiment, warrant a cautious approach. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent given the current risks.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's significant price drop and technical breakdown below key levels indicate a need to reduce exposure until stability returns.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish predictions, the current technical and market conditions do not support a strong directional move. Holding is advisable.

USDT: +0.2 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin exposure provides a hedge against further volatility in other crypto assets."

Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- **Altcoin sell-off drags ETH lower** – In a market-wide downturn, poor sentiment hit altcoins hard, pushing Ether down by over 8% on continuing bearish macro cues.

**Solana (SOL)**

- **Plunges below $150 to yearly low** – SOL tumbled past $150, marking its weakest price of the year amid a broader crypto sell-off.
- **Slides under $160 after weekend hack fallout** – Solana dropped below $160, losing over 7% intraday following the blanket impact of the ByBit incident.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience, with institutional interest potentially stabilizing its price, despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum has been hit hard by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline, exacerbated by a broader altcoin sell-off. Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced significant price drops, with Solana reaching a yearly low and Dogecoin facing bearish technical indicators despite speculative bullish predictions. In this environment, USDT remains stable, reflecting a cautious market with increased demand for stablecoins amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the price dip, institutional accumulation signals and relative outperformance suggest a moderate buy opportunity in a bearish market.

ETH: -0.5 — The impact of the ByBit hack and ongoing bearish sentiment in the altcoin market warrant reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

SOL: -0.3 — Continued price weakness and technical breakdowns indicate a need to reduce exposure, despite no major news beyond the hack impact.

DOGE: -0.2 — While speculative predictions exist, the current technical and market conditions are not supportive, suggesting a cautious reduction.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-24 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **Price slides under $94K amid broader market weakness** – Bitcoin dipped below $94K as equities weighed on sentiment; while it outperformed many altcoins, macro pressures continued to impact BTC.
- **Steady accumulation signs despite recent dip** – After a weekend hack triggered a price drop near $95K, institutions—including MicroStrategy hinted by Michael Saylor—are likely taking the opportunity to accumulate.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **Sharp decline following major hack** – Ethereum fell from $2.84K to $2.62K as stolen funds from a $1.5B ByBit hack, entirely in ETH, shook the market.
- **Altcoin sell-off drags ETH lower** – In a market-wide downturn, poor sentiment hit altcoins hard, pushing Ether down by over 8% on continuing bearish macro cues.

**Solana (SOL)**

- **Plunges below $150 to yearly low** – SOL tumbled past $150, marking its weakest price of the year amid a broader crypto sell-off.
- **Slides under $160 after weekend hack fallout** – Solana dropped below $160, losing over 7% intraday following the blanket impact of the ByBit incident.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Prominent analyst projects massive price surge** – A market expert predicted Dogecoin could surge as much as 19,533% to reach $45 during the current bull cycle.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies, primarily driven by macroeconomic pressures and a recent hack affecting Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin, while also declining, shows signs of institutional accumulation, suggesting some underlying confidence. Ethereum and Solana have been particularly hard hit due to the ByBit hack, leading to sharp sell-offs. Dogecoin, despite the broader downturn, has some speculative bullish sentiment due to an analyst's prediction of a massive price surge. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals potential support, and BTC's relative outperformance compared to altcoins suggests it may stabilize or recover sooner.

ETH: -0.4 — The impact of the ByBit hack and broader altcoin sell-off pressures ETH, with no immediate recovery signals in sight.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's price has reached a yearly low, exacerbated by the hack fallout, indicating further downside risk in the short term.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative bullish sentiment, the overall market conditions and lack of immediate catalysts keep DOGE neutral.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-24 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience compared to altcoins, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a recent dip below $94K. Ethereum and Solana have been significantly impacted by a major hack involving ByBit, leading to sharp declines in their prices. Dogecoin, while also affected by the broader market downturn, has seen some speculative interest due to bullish projections from analysts. USDT remains stable with no significant news, but its role as a safe haven may increase in the current volatile environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, institutional accumulation signals suggest potential for recovery. Relative resilience compared to altcoins supports a modest positive outlook.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent hack and subsequent sell-off have created downward pressure. The lack of bullish momentum and macroeconomic challenges warrant caution.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price drop to yearly lows and lack of positive momentum indicate a need to reduce exposure, especially given the broader market weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative interest exists, the overall market conditions and lack of strong technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.4 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-24 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown resilience compared to altcoins, maintaining a relatively stronger position despite dipping below $94K. Institutional interest, as suggested by accumulation signs, provides some support for BTC. Ethereum and Solana have been hit hard by a major hack at ByBit, leading to significant price declines and negative sentiment.

Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, institutional accumulation and relative strength compared to altcoins suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the ByBit hack and broader altcoin sell-off weigh heavily on Ethereum, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's significant price drop to a yearly low and negative sentiment from the hack fallout suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a bullish long-term projection but no immediate catalysts or changes in sentiment; maintain current position.

USDT: +0.2 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT provides a buffer against volatility."
2025-02-24 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown resilience compared to altcoins, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a recent dip below $94K. Ethereum has been significantly impacted by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price, while Solana has also experienced a substantial drop, hitting its yearly low. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, buoyed by speculative forecasts of a potential massive price surge. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, institutional accumulation signals potential for recovery. Relative strength compared to altcoins supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent hack and subsequent price drop create a bearish outlook. Lack of positive momentum and technical signals suggest reducing exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price decline and negative sentiment following the hack impact. Current technical indicators do not support a recovery, warranting caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed sentiment with speculative forecasts but no strong technical or market data support. Hold position due to lack of clear directional signals.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins is prudent. Positive technical indicators suggest continued demand for stability."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The crypto market is experiencing a bearish sentiment, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown resilience despite a dip below $94K, with signs of institutional accumulation. Ethereum has been hit hard by a significant hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price. Solana has reached a yearly low, exacerbated by the same hack affecting Ethereum. Dogecoin, while experiencing a price decrease, has some speculative bullish sentiment from analysts. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional interest and accumulation signals provide a moderately positive outlook, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: -0.5 — The major hack and subsequent price drop create a challenging environment for Ethereum, warranting a cautious approach and reduced exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — With Solana hitting a yearly low and negative sentiment from the hack fallout, reducing exposure is advisable until stability returns.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative bullish sentiment, the overall market conditions and recent price decline suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and need for stability, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to mitigate risk."
2025-02-24 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum has been significantly impacted by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price. Solana has also suffered from the broader sell-off, reaching its lowest price of the year. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, buoyed by speculative predictions of a potential surge. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable with no significant news, but its technical indicators suggest a breakout, reflecting a cautious market environment where investors may prefer to hold stable assets amidst volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional interest and accumulation signals provide a moderately positive outlook for Bitcoin, suggesting it could be a relatively safer allocation compared to other altcoins.

ETH: -0.5 — The recent hack and subsequent price decline have severely impacted Ethereum's sentiment and technical outlook, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's price has hit a yearly low, and the lack of positive momentum suggests further downside risk, justifying a reduction in holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there are speculative predictions of a massive surge, the lack of immediate technical or fundamental support keeps the allocation neutral.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the current bearish sentiment and volatility in the market, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for opportunistic re-entry into riskier assets when conditions improve."
2025-02-24 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience, with institutional interest suggesting potential accumulation despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum has been hit hard by a significant hack, causing a sharp decline and dragging the broader altcoin market down with it. Solana has reached a yearly low, exacerbated by the same hack. Meanwhile, Dogecoin remains relatively stable with speculative bullish forecasts, and Tether continues to display stability with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals and resilience compared to altcoins suggest a moderate buy opportunity.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant hack and subsequent price drop indicate caution, with bearish sentiment prevailing in the short term.

SOL: -0.2 — Continued downward pressure and reaching a yearly low suggest reducing exposure, though not entirely bearish due to potential recovery.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with speculative bullish forecasts but no substantial data-driven momentum, warranting a hold.

USDT: +0.2 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher stablecoin exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-24 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin, despite a dip below $94K, shows signs of accumulation by institutions, suggesting a potential for recovery. Ethereum has been hit hard by a major hack, leading to a significant price drop and negative sentiment. Solana also experienced a sharp decline, reaching a yearly low, exacerbated by the broader market downturn and hack fallout. Dogecoin, however, has a positive outlook due to bullish projections from analysts, although this is speculative. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, institutional accumulation hints at potential recovery, making it relatively attractive in a bearish market.

ETH: -0.3 — The recent hack and subsequent sell-off have severely impacted sentiment, warranting caution and reduced exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — The significant price drop to a yearly low and lack of positive momentum suggest a cautious stance, though not a full exit.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative bullish projections could drive interest, but the lack of concrete data support tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins provides a buffer against volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of bearish macroeconomic pressures and specific asset-related challenges. Bitcoin has shown some resilience despite a recent dip, with signs of institutional accumulation. However, Ethereum and Solana have been notably impacted by a significant hack, leading to sharp declines in their prices. Dogecoin, on the other hand, has seen speculative interest with predictions of a massive price surge, although this is not supported by immediate market data. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and stable gold prices, suggests a cautious approach, with some investors potentially seeking safety in stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price dips, institutional accumulation signals and bullish momentum indicators suggest a moderate buy opportunity.

ETH: -0.3 — The recent hack and subsequent price decline create a bearish outlook, compounded by negative macro sentiment and technical indicators.

SOL: -0.4 — The asset is under pressure from the broader market sell-off and recent hack, with no immediate bullish signals to counteract the decline.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative predictions are positive, the lack of supporting technical or on-chain data keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the bearish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies and macroeconomic uncertainty, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT is prudent for risk management."
2025-02-24 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown resilience compared to altcoins, maintaining some institutional interest despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum and Solana have been significantly impacted by a major hack, leading to sharp declines in their prices. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, with speculative optimism from analysts suggesting potential for a massive price surge. In contrast, Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent dips, Bitcoin shows signs of accumulation and maintains bullish momentum, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum faces significant pressure from the recent hack and broader altcoin sell-off, warranting caution.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's price has hit a yearly low, and the negative sentiment from the hack fallout suggests further downside risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative predictions exist, there is no substantial data or sentiment shift to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.4 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-24 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing significant declines due to a major hack involving ByBit, which has shaken investor confidence and led to a broader altcoin sell-off. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with speculative bullish predictions, but lacks immediate catalysts. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals provide a positive outlook, suggesting potential for recovery.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the ByBit hack and broader altcoin sell-off pressures suggest caution, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price decline and negative sentiment following the hack indicate a need to reduce exposure further.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with speculative bullish predictions but no immediate data-driven catalysts; maintain current holdings.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of bearish market conditions, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides a buffer against volatility."
2025-02-24 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant downward pressure on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is largely due to a recent hack affecting ByBit, which has led to a sharp decline in Ethereum prices and a broader sell-off across altcoins, including Solana. Bitcoin has also been affected by macroeconomic pressures, though there are signs of institutional accumulation at lower price levels. Meanwhile, Dogecoin remains relatively stable with speculative bullish predictions, and Tether continues to serve as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price dip, institutional accumulation signals suggest potential for recovery. However, macroeconomic pressures remain a concern.

ETH: -0.3 — The recent hack has severely impacted Ethereum's price and sentiment, warranting a cautious approach until stability returns.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana has hit a yearly low, and the lack of bullish signals suggests further downside risk, especially in light of the recent market-wide sell-off.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative predictions exist, there is no substantial data or sentiment shift to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current bearish market conditions, maintaining liquidity in USDT is prudent to manage risk and capitalize on potential buying opportunities later."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The crypto market is experiencing a downturn, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security breaches. Bitcoin has dipped below $94K, but there are signs of institutional accumulation, suggesting some underlying confidence. Ethereum has been hit hard by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in price. Solana is also facing significant pressure, dropping to its lowest price of the year. Dogecoin remains relatively stable, with speculative predictions of a massive price surge, though these are not supported by current market conditions. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the price dip, institutional accumulation suggests potential for recovery. The broader market weakness tempers a stronger buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — The recent hack and subsequent sell-off create a bearish outlook, though the long-term potential remains intact. Current sentiment is negative.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drops and negative news sentiment indicate a need to reduce exposure until stability returns.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative predictions of a surge are not supported by current data, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a safe haven and potential for future reallocation into riskier assets."
2025-02-24 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant pressure on major cryptocurrencies following a recent hack that affected Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin has also experienced a price dip, although it shows signs of institutional accumulation. Ethereum and Solana are particularly impacted by the hack, leading to sharp declines in their prices. Dogecoin, despite the overall downturn, has a speculative bullish outlook from a prominent analyst, suggesting potential for a significant price surge. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, Bitcoin shows signs of institutional accumulation, which could support a recovery. However, macro pressures continue to weigh on the asset.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum is under significant pressure from the recent hack and broader altcoin sell-off, suggesting caution in increasing exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana has reached a yearly low due to the hack's impact, indicating a need to reduce exposure until stability returns.

DOGE: +0.1 — Speculative sentiment suggests potential for a price surge, but current market conditions warrant a cautious approach.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-24 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has dipped below $94K, influenced by broader market weakness and a recent hack, though institutional accumulation hints at potential future support. Ethereum is experiencing significant pressure due to a major hack involving stolen funds, leading to a sharp decline in its price. Solana has reached a yearly low, exacerbated by the same hack, indicating a lack of immediate recovery. Dogecoin, despite a bearish market, has a bullish projection from a prominent analyst, suggesting potential future gains. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals potential support, making BTC relatively attractive in a bearish market.

ETH: -0.5 — The significant impact of the ByBit hack and continued bearish sentiment suggest reducing exposure to ETH.

SOL: -0.3 — With SOL hitting a yearly low and lacking positive momentum, it is prudent to reduce exposure.

DOGE: +0.1 — While the market is bearish, the bullish projection from an analyst provides a slight positive outlook for DOGE.

USDT: +0.4 — In a bearish environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-02-24 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has dipped below $94K, impacted by broader market weakness, although institutional interest suggests potential accumulation. Ethereum has been hit hard by a major hack, causing a significant price drop, and is further pressured by a general altcoin sell-off. Solana has reached a yearly low, exacerbated by the same hack that affected Ethereum. Dogecoin, despite the overall negative sentiment, has seen speculative bullish projections from analysts, though these are not yet reflected in market data. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid the volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals potential support, and BTC's relative strength compared to altcoins suggests a moderate buy.

ETH: -0.3 — The recent hack and subsequent price drop create a bearish outlook, compounded by negative sentiment across altcoins.

SOL: -0.4 — With Solana hitting a yearly low and no positive catalysts, reducing exposure is prudent given the current market conditions.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative projections are bullish, the lack of supportive data or significant market movement suggests a hold position.

USDT: +0.4 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is advisable for stability and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience compared to altcoins, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum and Solana have been significantly impacted by a major hack, leading to sharp declines in their prices. Ethereum's drop was exacerbated by a broader altcoin sell-off, while Solana hit a yearly low. Dogecoin has seen speculative interest with predictions of a massive price surge, though this is not supported by current technical indicators. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation suggests potential for recovery. However, macro pressures limit a stronger buy signal.

ETH: -0.5 — The impact of the ByBit hack and broader altcoin sell-off create significant downward pressure, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — With Solana hitting a yearly low and ongoing bearish sentiment, reducing exposure is prudent until clearer recovery signals emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative predictions of a surge exist, current technical indicators do not support a strong directional move.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and volatility, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins is advisable for capital preservation."
2025-02-24 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries

- **Steady accumulation signs despite recent dip** – After a weekend hack triggered a price drop near $95K, institutions—including MicroStrategy hinted by Michael Saylor—are likely taking the opportunity to accumulate.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **Altcoin sell-off drags ETH lower** – In a market-wide downturn, poor sentiment hit altcoins hard, pushing Ether down by over 8% on continuing bearish macro cues.

**Solana (SOL)**

- **Plunges below $150 to yearly low** – SOL tumbled past $150, marking its weakest price of the year amid a broader crypto sell-off.
- **Slides under $160 after weekend hack fallout** – Solana dropped below $160, losing over 7% intraday following the blanket impact of the ByBit incident.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies following a major hack affecting ByBit, leading to a sell-off in Ethereum and a broader impact on altcoins like Solana. Bitcoin, while also affected, shows signs of institutional accumulation, indicating some underlying support despite the price dip. The macroeconomic environment remains challenging, with high volatility and pressure from equities impacting crypto markets. Dogecoin, despite the downturn, has a bullish outlook from some analysts, though this is speculative. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the price dip, institutional accumulation suggests underlying support. Relative strength compared to altcoins makes it a more attractive option in a bearish market.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant price decline due to the hack and broader altcoin sell-off. Negative sentiment and technicals suggest reducing exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Reached a yearly low with no positive momentum or news to support a rebound. Continued bearish sentiment warrants reducing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative bullish predictions exist, the current technicals and market sentiment do not support a strong move in either direction.

USDT: +0.4 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and reduce risk."
2025-02-24 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and a significant hack affecting Ethereum. Bitcoin has shown some resilience compared to altcoins, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum has been hit hard by the ByBit hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price. Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced significant price drops, with Solana reaching a yearly low. The news of a potential massive surge in Dogecoin lacks immediate impact given the current bearish environment. Tether remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation suggests potential support and resilience. The macro environment remains challenging, but BTC is relatively stronger compared to other assets.

ETH: -0.5 — The impact of the ByBit hack and broader altcoin sell-off has significantly weakened ETH's position. The bearish sentiment and technical breakdown warrant caution.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's price has reached a yearly low, and the lack of positive momentum or recovery signals suggests maintaining a cautious stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative news of a potential surge, the current market conditions and technical indicators do not support an immediate bullish stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-24 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic jitters and a significant hack at Bybit, which has led to a sharp sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin seeing its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum affected by the fallout from the Bybit hack. Solana has also seen a significant drop, marking its lowest level in four months. Dogecoin, while also declining, has some potential for a rebound according to technical analysis. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its CEO highlighting its importance despite regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — With Bitcoin experiencing significant downward pressure due to macroeconomic concerns and the Bybit hack, reducing exposure is prudent to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is similarly affected by the Bybit hack, and despite some repurchasing activity, the overall sentiment remains weak, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of positive signals suggest reducing exposure to manage potential further downside.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, there is potential for a rebound, but the current market conditions do not provide a clear buy signal, justifying a hold position.

USDT: +0.7 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for quick reallocation when market conditions improve."
2025-02-25 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and significant negative events such as the $1.5 billion hack at Bybit. This has led to sharp declines across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin experiencing its largest single-day drop of the year, and Ethereum and Solana also seeing substantial losses. Despite the downturn, there are some signs of potential recovery in specific assets, such as Dogecoin, where analysts suggest a possible rebound. Meanwhile, Tether remains a stable choice amidst volatility, though it faces regulatory scrutiny.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Given the significant sell-off and negative news, reducing exposure to BTC is prudent, especially as it faces macroeconomic pressures and security concerns.

ETH: 0.0 — Although ETH has been impacted by the Bybit hack, the OTC purchase by Bybit suggests some underlying support. Maintaining a neutral stance is advisable.

SOL: -0.3 — With Solana hitting a four-month low and no immediate recovery signals, it's sensible to reduce exposure slightly, focusing on risk management.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the recent drop, technical analysis indicates potential for a sharp rebound, warranting a slight increase in allocation to capitalize on possible recovery.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is beneficial for capital preservation and liquidity, despite regulatory concerns."
2025-02-25 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial declines. Despite the downturn, Dogecoin shows potential for a rebound according to technical analysis, while Tether remains stable amidst regulatory pressures. The macroeconomic context, with a high U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stability and risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is under pressure from macroeconomic factors and the Bybit hack, with no bullish technical signals. Reducing exposure is prudent given the negative market sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's price is affected by the Bybit hack, but the OTC buyback by Bybit offers some support. Maintaining a neutral stance as the market digests recent events.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana has experienced a sharp decline, hitting a four-month low. The lack of positive signals and broader market weakness suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the overall market decline, Dogecoin shows potential for a rebound. A slight increase in allocation could capture potential upside, but caution is warranted.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides stability and liquidity, allowing for flexibility in future allocations."
2025-02-25 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial declines. Despite the downturn, there is some optimism for DOGE, with analysts suggesting potential for a significant rebound. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, though there are concerns about regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant price drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate further downside risk.

ETH: -0.3 — The fallout from the Bybit hack has severely impacted ETH, and with no immediate recovery signals, maintaining a cautious stance is prudent.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of positive momentum indicate a need to reduce exposure until clearer recovery signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the overall market decline, potential for a rebound and bullish projections warrant a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, despite regulatory concerns."
2025-02-25 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to substantial sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines due to these factors, with Bitcoin registering its largest single-day drop of the year. Solana has also seen a sharp decline, hitting a four-month low. Despite the downturn, Dogecoin shows potential for a rebound, as suggested by technical analysts. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, although it faces potential regulatory pressures. In this environment, risk-averse strategies are advisable, with a focus on maintaining liquidity and stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Given the significant sell-off and bearish sentiment, reducing exposure to Bitcoin is prudent, especially considering the lack of bullish technical signals.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit hack, with weak market sentiment and no positive technical indicators, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of positive momentum suggest reducing exposure, as it remains vulnerable to further downside in the current market environment.

DOGE: +0.1 — Despite the recent drop, technical analysis indicates potential for a rebound, justifying a slight positive allocation to capture potential upside.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market, increasing exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for capital preservation amidst heightened volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has affected major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, and Ethereum has also slumped significantly due to the hack's fallout. Solana has seen a sharp decline, marking a four-month low, while Dogecoin, despite its drop, shows potential for a rebound according to some analysts. Tether remains stable, but its CEO has raised concerns about potential regulatory pressures. In this environment, risk aversion is prevalent, and there is a cautious approach towards non-stablecoin assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and bearish sentiment, compounded by macroeconomic pressures, suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's decline due to the Bybit hack and weak market sentiment warrants a cautious approach, though the OTC buyback by Bybit provides some support.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline and hitting a four-month low indicate a need to reduce exposure, as the market remains bearish.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the drop, potential for a rebound exists as per analysts, but current market conditions do not strongly support increasing exposure.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining or increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2025-02-25 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, and Ethereum has also seen a substantial decline due to the fallout from the Bybit hack. Solana has plunged to a four-month low, reflecting the broader market sell-off. Dogecoin has also dropped significantly, although there is some technical analysis suggesting potential for a rebound. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with its importance reaffirmed despite concerns about regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate further downside risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's decline due to the Bybit hack and weak market sentiment indicate a cautious stance, though the OTC buyback provides some support.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of positive technical indicators suggest reducing exposure in the face of continued bearish pressure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, potential for a technical rebound exists, warranting a hold position to observe further developments.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity, aligning with risk-averse strategies."
2025-02-25 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin registering its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum affected by the fallout from the Bybit hack. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen significant price decreases, though there is some speculative potential for a Dogecoin rebound. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its CEO addressing regulatory pressures but reaffirming its importance in the digital currency ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.5** — Bitcoin is experiencing a strong bearish trend due to macroeconomic jitters and the Bybit hack, suggesting a need to reduce exposure given the current holdings.

**ETH: -0.3** — Ethereum is similarly affected by the Bybit incident and shows no bullish technical signals, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

**SOL: -0.2** — Solana's sharp decline and lack of positive momentum signals suggest maintaining a reduced exposure, though the current holding is minimal.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Despite a significant drop, there is potential for a rebound, but current market conditions do not justify increasing exposure at this time.

**USDT: +0.8** — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining a strong position in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-25 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns, such as U.S. tariff issues, and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum has also seen a substantial decline due to the fallout from the Bybit hack.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and negative news sentiment, along with bearish technical indicators, suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's decline due to the Bybit hack and weak market sentiment warrants a cautious approach, though the OTC buyback offers some support.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of positive technical signals indicate a need to reduce exposure in the current bearish environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the drop, there is potential for a rebound, but current market conditions and technical indicators do not support a strong buy or sell signal.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for stability, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, exacerbated by global economic jitters and the Bybit hack. Ethereum has also been hit hard, with a notable drop in price despite Bybit's efforts to stabilize by purchasing ETH through OTC trades. Solana has reached a four-month low following a sharp decline. Dogecoin, while also affected by the downturn, has some potential for a rebound according to technical analysts. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its CEO defending its importance amidst regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The significant price drop and bearish macroeconomic conditions suggest reducing exposure, especially given the lack of positive technical signals.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite Bybit's repurchase efforts, the overall sentiment remains weak, and the asset is under pressure from the broader market sell-off.

SOL: -0.4 — With Solana hitting a four-month low and no positive signals, it's prudent to reduce exposure in light of the sharp decline.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although the market is down, potential for a rebound exists, balancing the current bearish sentiment with future upside potential.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining or increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to preserve capital and reduce risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum and Solana also saw substantial declines. Despite the downturn, there are some indications of potential recovery, particularly for Dogecoin, which analysts suggest could rebound sharply. Tether remains a stable option amidst the volatility, though it faces regulatory scrutiny.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given the macroeconomic pressures and exchange hack impact.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's decline is exacerbated by the Bybit hack, and while there was some repurchase activity, sentiment remains weak, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline to a four-month low indicates a need to reduce exposure until clearer recovery signals emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the drop, potential for a rebound exists, but current market conditions do not strongly support an increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-25 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has affected major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum and Solana also saw substantial declines. Despite the downturn, there is some optimism for Dogecoin, with analysts suggesting potential for a rebound. Tether remains a stable component amid the volatility, though it faces regulatory scrutiny.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and ongoing bearish sentiment suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, especially given the lack of positive technical signals.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, Ethereum's repurchase by Bybit indicates some institutional support. However, the overall sentiment remains weak, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline to a four-month low and lack of bullish signals suggest a cautious approach, reducing exposure slightly.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has also dropped, the potential for a rebound as indicated by technical analysis warrants a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-25 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin seeing its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum being heavily impacted by the Bybit hack. Solana and Dogecoin have also suffered significant losses, although there are some technical indicators suggesting potential for a rebound in Dogecoin. In contrast, Tether remains stable, with its CEO emphasizing its importance despite facing regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and bearish macroeconomic context suggest reducing exposure, especially given the current holding.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the sell-off, the repurchase by Bybit indicates some underlying support, but overall sentiment remains weak.

SOL: 0.0 — The sharp decline reflects broader market weakness, but no immediate signals suggest a strong rebound or further decline.

DOGE: +0.2 — While it has dropped, technical analysis hints at rebound potential, making it slightly more attractive for capital allocation.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-02-25 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin seeing its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum being impacted by the Bybit hack.

Tether remains stable, although there are concerns about regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent significant drop in Bitcoin's price and the lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach. Current macroeconomic conditions and the Bybit hack exacerbate the bearish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's price has been negatively impacted by the Bybit hack, but the OTC purchase by Bybit indicates some underlying support. The mixed signals warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.1 — Solana's sharp decline to a four-month low suggests caution, although there is some bullish momentum in recent hours. The overall market sentiment remains negative.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the recent drop, technical analysis suggests potential for a rebound. The possibility of a sharp recovery justifies a slightly positive outlook.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has led to a sharp decline in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced substantial drops, with Bitcoin hitting its lowest level since mid-November and Ethereum affected by the fallout from the Bybit hack. Solana has also seen a significant decline, marking its lowest level in four months. Dogecoin has dropped as part of the general market downturn, although there are some bullish projections for a potential rebound. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory scrutiny, highlighting its importance in the digital dollar ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The market sell-off and largest single-day dip of the year indicate a bearish trend. Given the current holdings, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the significant drop, the repurchase by Bybit suggests some underlying support. However, the overall sentiment remains weak, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana has experienced a sharp decline, the continued bullish momentum signal and potential for recovery suggest a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the drop, analysts suggest potential for a rebound. However, given current holdings and market conditions, maintaining a neutral position is advisable.

USDT: +0.3 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is favorable to manage risk and preserve capital."
2025-02-25 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced substantial declines, with Bitcoin registering its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum being affected by the fallout from the Bybit hack. Solana has also seen a sharp decline, hitting a four-month low. Despite these challenges, there are some signs of potential recovery, particularly for Dogecoin, where analysts suggest a possible rebound. In contrast, Tether remains stable, though it faces potential regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The significant sell-off and bearish news, including the Bybit hack, suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, despite already minimal holdings.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum has been hit hard by the Bybit incident, the OTC buyback by Bybit indicates some institutional confidence, suggesting a cautious re-entry.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of strong recovery signals warrant a reduction in exposure to mitigate further losses.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the overall market decline, technical analysis suggests potential for a rebound, making a small increase in exposure reasonable.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-25 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has led to a sharp decline in cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced substantial drops, with Bitcoin hitting its lowest level since mid-November and Ethereum affected by the Bybit hack. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen significant declines, although there is some technical analysis suggesting potential for a Dogecoin rebound. Tether remains stable, but there are concerns about regulatory pressures. In this environment, risk aversion is prevalent, and capital preservation is a priority.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant price drop and negative news sentiment suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, especially given its current bearish trend and macroeconomic pressures.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the impact of the Bybit hack and overall market sentiment warrant a cautious approach, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Although Solana has experienced a sharp decline, the lack of a strong recovery signal or positive news suggests maintaining current holdings without increasing exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has dropped, technical analysis indicates potential for a rebound, justifying a slight increase in exposure to capture possible upside.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent for capital preservation and to maintain liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-25 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum has also slumped significantly due to the hack. Solana and Dogecoin have similarly faced substantial declines, although there is some technical analysis suggesting potential for a Dogecoin rebound. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its perceived safety as a stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the significant drop, Bitcoin's current price level and lack of immediate bullish signals suggest a neutral stance. The macroeconomic environment and recent news do not support a strong buy or sell decision.

ETH: -0.2 — The fallout from the Bybit hack has created negative sentiment around Ethereum. Although there was a repurchase by Bybit, the overall market sentiment remains weak, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of strong recovery signals suggest maintaining current exposure. The bearish market conditions do not provide a compelling reason to increase allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the drop, technical analysis indicates potential for a rebound. Given the possibility of a sharp recovery, a slight increase in allocation is justified.

USDT: +0.5 — With the current bearish market conditions and potential regulatory pressures on Tether, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage, despite the ongoing scrutiny."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and the significant impact of a $1.5 billion hack at Bybit. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, and Ethereum has also slumped significantly due to the hack fallout. Solana and Dogecoin have both seen substantial declines, with Solana hitting a four-month low. Despite the downturn, there are some indications of potential rebounds, particularly for Dogecoin. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory pressures, as highlighted by its CEO.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent sell-off and negative news, there is no current holding to adjust. The bearish sentiment is balanced by the potential for stabilization after the significant drop.

ETH: -0.3 — The fallout from the Bybit hack has heavily impacted Ethereum, and while there was a repurchase by Bybit, the overall sentiment remains weak. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent given the current holdings.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's sharp decline suggests caution, but given the existing holdings, a moderate reduction is advisable to manage risk amid the bearish environment.

DOGE: +0.1 — Although Dogecoin has dropped, analysts suggest potential for a rebound. A slight increase in allocation reflects this potential upside while acknowledging current market conditions.

USDT: +0.4 — In a bearish market, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is sensible to preserve capital and manage risk, especially given the regulatory concerns surrounding Tether."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin registering its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum being heavily impacted by the Bybit hack. Despite this, Ethereum saw some buying activity from Bybit, which could provide some support. Solana and Dogecoin have also faced sharp declines, though Dogecoin shows potential for a rebound according to technical analysts. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory pressures, as highlighted by its CEO.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite the recent sell-off, Bitcoin's price is stabilizing within its Bollinger Bands, and there is no clear buy signal from technical indicators. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, suggesting a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Although Ethereum has been affected by the Bybit hack, the repurchase of ETH by Bybit indicates some institutional support. Bullish momentum persists, warranting a cautious positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana shows bullish momentum and a potential breakout above its Bollinger Bands, suggesting a possible recovery. The recent price increase and buy signal from moving averages support a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin has experienced a decline, the potential for a sharp rebound as suggested by technical analysis keeps the outlook neutral. No immediate changes in allocation are warranted.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current bearish market sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a defensive stance. Despite regulatory concerns, its stability and liquidity are advantageous in uncertain conditions."
2025-02-25 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The crypto market is currently experiencing a bearish sentiment driven by macroeconomic concerns, including U.S. tariff issues and a significant security breach at Bybit. This has led to substantial declines across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing significant sell-offs. Despite the downturn, there are some signs of resilience, such as Bybit's strategic repurchase of ETH during the dip. Solana and Dogecoin have also faced sharp declines, though there is some speculative optimism for a potential rebound in Dogecoin. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable but is under scrutiny due to regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines and bearish news, BTC shows some signs of stabilization with a slight recovery in the last hour. However, the overall macroeconomic environment remains challenging.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's price has shown resilience with bullish momentum signals, and strategic repurchases by Bybit suggest confidence in its recovery potential despite recent declines.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana has shown a buy signal with bullish momentum, and its recent price increase suggests potential for a recovery, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although there is speculative potential for a rebound, the current market conditions and low on-chain activity do not provide a strong enough basis for a directional move.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility to capitalize on future opportunities."
2025-02-25 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum also saw a substantial decline due to the hack. Solana and Dogecoin have similarly faced sharp declines, although there is some technical analysis suggesting potential for a Dogecoin rebound. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, but faces regulatory scrutiny, highlighting its critical role in the digital currency ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the recent sell-off, Bitcoin's price is stabilizing with bullish momentum signals emerging. However, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum is showing bullish momentum and has seen significant OTC purchases by Bybit, indicating potential support despite the recent downturn.

SOL: +0.1 — Solana's recent price drop presents a potential buying opportunity, supported by bullish momentum signals, though caution is warranted given the broader market conditions.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although there are bullish projections for a rebound, the current market data does not strongly support immediate action, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bearish sentiment across the market, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent, but some capital rotation into other assets with potential upside is considered."
2025-02-25 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin hitting its lowest point since mid-November and Ethereum dropping over 8% due to the hack.

Tether remains stable but faces regulatory pressure, highlighting its critical role in the digital dollar ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent market sell-off and security breach have significantly impacted Bitcoin, with no immediate bullish signals. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current macroeconomic and security concerns.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's decline due to the Bybit hack and weak market sentiment suggests a cautious approach. Despite some recovery efforts, the overall outlook remains negative.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp drop to a four-month low indicates a need to reduce exposure. The lack of positive momentum and broader market sell-off contribute to this decision.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the overall decline, Dogecoin shows potential for a rebound. However, given the current market conditions, maintaining a neutral stance is advisable until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is beneficial to preserve capital and provide liquidity for potential future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has impacted major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop this year, falling below $90K, while Ethereum and Solana have also suffered from the fallout of the Bybit hack. Despite these declines, some assets, like Dogecoin, show potential for a rebound, as suggested by technical analysis. Tether remains stable, though it faces regulatory scrutiny, highlighting its critical role in the digital currency ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and bearish market sentiment, combined with the absence of strong buy signals, suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the Bybit hack on Ethereum and weak market sentiment indicate a cautious approach, with a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of positive news or technical indicators suggest reducing exposure to manage potential downside risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, potential rebound signals and mixed sentiment warrant a neutral stance, holding current positions.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for stability, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven to preserve capital."
2025-02-26 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with a recent sharp decline in Bitcoin due to geopolitical concerns, specifically U.S. tariff announcements. However, on-chain indicators suggest a potential bottom, as heavy selling by short-term holders has occurred. Ethereum shows signs of recovery after a significant dip, bolstered by substantial whale purchases, indicating confidence in a rebound. Solana is experiencing a substantial downturn, with a significant drop from its all-time high and a sharp decline in trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining its status quo. Tether remains stable, though it faces legal challenges, while developments on the Tron network could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop due to tariff concerns, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and bullish momentum remains.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong whale activity and signs of recovery from the recent dip indicate potential for upward movement, supported by bullish technical indicators.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price decline and a sharp drop in trading volumes suggest weak sentiment and potential downside risk, despite bullish technical indicators.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market volatility and legal issues, maintaining a slight preference for stability with USDT is prudent, though overall risk appetite is not strongly shifting towards stablecoins."
2025-02-26 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic despite recent volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp price drop due to geopolitical concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom, which could indicate a recovery opportunity. Ethereum has shown resilience with significant whale purchases during a price dip, signaling confidence in its recovery potential. Solana, however, is facing significant challenges with a substantial drop from its all-time high and declining trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its market position. Tether is experiencing legal challenges, but its utility is expected to improve with upcoming gas-free transfers on the Tron network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops due to tariff concerns, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, indicating potential for recovery. Maintain a cautious buy stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong whale accumulation during the sell-off and signs of price recovery suggest a positive outlook. Increase exposure slightly.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant decline from all-time highs and plummeting trading volumes indicate weak sentiment. Reduce exposure slightly to manage risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in market data. Maintain current position with no adjustments.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential recovery in major cryptocurrencies, reduce stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital towards risk assets."
2025-02-26 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 19.1. The recent market data reveals mixed signals across cryptocurrencies, with some assets showing bullish momentum despite recent price drops. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline due to geopolitical concerns but shows signs of reaching a local bottom. Ethereum is attempting a recovery with significant whale accumulation, suggesting confidence in its potential rebound. Solana is facing significant challenges, with a dramatic drop in trading volumes and price, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin shows positive momentum but lacks significant news to drive further movement. Tether remains stable, though it faces legal challenges that could impact its perception.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops due to tariff concerns, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, and bullish momentum persists, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — The whale accumulation and recovery attempts indicate strong confidence and potential for a rebound, making ETH relatively attractive in the current market.

SOL: -0.2 — Given the significant drop from its all-time high and declining trading volumes, SOL faces bearish sentiment, suggesting a cautious reduction in exposure.

DOGE: +0.1 — Positive momentum is present, but the lack of significant news limits the potential for a strong upward move, resulting in a slight preference for holding.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential rebounds in major cryptocurrencies and a stable macro environment, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a significant price drop due to macroeconomic concerns, specifically U.S. tariff announcements, which has led to heavy selling by short-term holders. However, some indicators suggest a local bottom may have been reached. Ethereum shows signs of recovery after a significant dip, supported by large purchases from whale investors, indicating potential confidence in a rebound. Solana is under pressure, hitting a five-month low with drastically reduced trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but shows bullish momentum in technical indicators. Tether remains stable, with developments in its transfer mechanisms on the Tron network, though it faces legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the recent price drop, on-chain indicators suggest a potential bottom, and bullish momentum remains. Caution is warranted, but a slight positive allocation is justified.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong buy signals from whales and a recovery attempt from recent lows indicate potential for upward movement. The technical indicators are supportive of a positive allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and reduced trading volumes indicate bearish sentiment. Current holdings should be reduced slightly due to weak market conditions.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical momentum and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for gains, despite the lack of significant news.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintain current stablecoin holdings as a hedge against volatility, given the mixed market sentiment and ongoing legal issues."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously bullish, with several assets showing signs of recovery after recent declines. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop due to geopolitical concerns but shows signs of stabilization as on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom. Ethereum is witnessing renewed interest from large holders, indicating potential confidence despite recent volatility. Solana has suffered significant losses and reduced trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but shows consistent on-chain activity. Tether remains stable, though legal issues could impact its perception.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and stabilization is expected as geopolitical concerns are absorbed.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong buying interest from whales and a potential rebound from recent lows indicate a favorable outlook.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price drop and reduced trading volumes suggest caution, though it remains a potential recovery candidate if market sentiment improves.

DOGE: 0.0 — Consistent on-chain activity but no significant news or changes in sentiment warrant a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With signs of recovery in risk assets, there is a slight preference for rotating out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential market rebounds."
2025-02-26 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a stable U.S. dollar and relatively high gold prices, indicating a cautious market sentiment. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp price drop due to geopolitical concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum is showing signs of recovery after a significant dip, with notable whale activity indicating confidence. Solana has seen a dramatic decline in both price and trading volume, reflecting weak sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining its current trajectory. Tether remains stable, though legal issues could pose risks. Overall, the market is in a state of cautious optimism with potential for recovery in certain assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, and bullish momentum is present. However, geopolitical risks warrant caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and signs of recovery from recent lows indicate potential upside, supported by bullish momentum.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price and volume declines suggest caution, despite technical buy signals. Current sentiment is weak.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the cautious market sentiment and ongoing legal issues, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation is prudent for risk management."
2025-02-26 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 19.1. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin facing a significant price drop due to geopolitical tensions and tariff announcements, while Ethereum shows signs of recovery driven by whale activity. Solana is under pressure, hitting a multi-month low with drastically reduced trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, but its technical indicators suggest bullish momentum. Tether remains stable, though legal issues could impact its perception.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price drop due to tariff concerns and heavy selling pressure suggests caution. Despite on-chain indicators hinting at a local bottom, the geopolitical factors warrant a conservative stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and a potential bounce from oversold conditions indicate a positive outlook. The technical indicators support a moderate increase in exposure.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and reduced trading volumes reflect weak sentiment and potential further downside. The lack of positive catalysts suggests reducing exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the absence of significant news, technical indicators show bullish momentum, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market conditions and potential for further volatility, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against market fluctuations."
2025-02-26 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent macroeconomic developments and asset-specific news influencing short-term movements. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline due to geopolitical concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential bottom. Ethereum shows signs of recovery with significant whale purchases, indicating confidence despite recent volatility. Solana is facing bearish pressure, with trading volumes and prices significantly down from recent highs. Dogecoin remains stable with no major news, while Tether's legal challenges and upcoming improvements in transfer efficiency could impact its stability. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by moderate volatility and stable commodity prices, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops due to tariff concerns, on-chain data suggests a local bottom, which could present a buying opportunity as the market stabilizes.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong whale accumulation and signs of price recovery indicate potential upside, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price and volume declines, coupled with weak sentiment, suggest caution. However, given current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data results in a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite potentially increases with signs of stabilization in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to macroeconomic pressures such as U.S. tariff concerns impacting Bitcoin and broader market volatility. Bitcoin experienced a sharp price drop due to these concerns, although on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum shows signs of recovery with significant whale purchases, indicating confidence despite recent sell-offs. Solana is facing significant challenges, with a drastic drop from its all-time high and a sharp decline in trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news. Tether is stable, but legal challenges could impact its perception.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price drop due to macroeconomic factors, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and the overall trend remains bullish.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong whale buying activity and signs of recovery from recent lows indicate potential for upward movement, making it relatively attractive.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and declining trading volumes suggest weak sentiment and potential further downside, warranting caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential recovery in major cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure to allocate capital towards more promising assets is advisable."
2025-02-26 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of recovery after recent declines. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop due to geopolitical concerns but is showing signs of stabilization with on-chain indicators suggesting a local bottom. Ethereum is attempting a recovery, bolstered by significant whale purchases, indicating confidence in its long-term potential. Solana has been hit hard, with a significant drop from its all-time high and a dramatic decrease in trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news affecting its trajectory. Tether's legal challenges may create some uncertainty, but its role as a stablecoin provides a safe haven amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price drops due to geopolitical factors, on-chain data suggests a local bottom, indicating potential for recovery. The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, supporting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong whale accumulation and attempts at price recovery signal confidence in Ethereum's potential rebound. The technical indicators are supportive of a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and plummeting trading volumes reflect weak sentiment and potential further downside, warranting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, Dogecoin remains stable, justifying a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market shows signs of recovery and risk appetite increases, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."
2025-02-26 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of bearish macroeconomic signals and some positive technical indicators. The recent announcement of U.S. tariffs has led to a sharp decline in Bitcoin's price, suggesting heightened market uncertainty. However, on-chain data indicates that a local bottom might have been reached, with significant selling by short-term holders. Ethereum shows signs of recovery after a whale group made a substantial purchase, indicating confidence despite recent price dips. Solana is experiencing significant challenges, with a dramatic drop in trading volumes and price, reflecting weak sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether's legal issues and upcoming improvements in transfer efficiency on Tron are noteworthy.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops due to macroeconomic concerns, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and technical indicators remain bullish.

ETH: +0.5 — The substantial purchase by a whale group and signs of price recovery indicate potential upside, supported by bullish technical indicators.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant declines in price and trading volume, coupled with weak sentiment, suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a hold position.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT for stability is prudent."
2025-02-26 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and attempts at price recovery suggest confidence and potential for upside. Favorable conditions for a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and reduced trading volumes indicate ongoing weakness. Reduce exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data suggests maintaining current holdings without adjustment.

USDT: -0.2 — With some assets showing recovery potential, consider a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities."
2025-02-26 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop due to macroeconomic concerns, specifically U.S. tariff announcements, which have contributed to a 5% price decline. Ethereum, despite a notable price drop, has seen some buying interest from large holders, suggesting potential confidence in a recovery. Solana has been hit hard, with its price reaching a five-month low and trading volumes plummeting, indicating weak market sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether faces legal challenges but benefits from upcoming improvements in transaction efficiency on the Tron network. In this environment, maintaining a cautious approach with a focus on capital preservation is prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some on-chain indicators suggesting a local bottom, the recent sharp price drop and macroeconomic concerns warrant a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.2 — The buying activity from whales indicates some confidence in recovery, but the recent price volatility suggests a moderate approach.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and reduced trading volumes highlight weak sentiment, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and capital preservation strategy."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a bearish sentiment, with major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH experiencing significant price declines due to macroeconomic concerns such as U.S. tariff announcements. BTC has seen a sharp price drop, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom, indicating some resilience. ETH has also faced a steep decline but shows signs of recovery, bolstered by strategic purchases from whale groups. SOL is under significant pressure, reaching a five-month low with a dramatic drop in trading volumes, reflecting weak market confidence. DOGE remains relatively stable with no significant news, while USDT maintains its role as a safe haven amid market volatility, despite ongoing legal issues.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, on-chain indicators suggest a potential bottom, and the overall market sentiment may stabilize, making BTC moderately attractive for accumulation.

ETH: +0.2 — The strategic buying by whale groups indicates confidence, and the potential for a price recovery makes ETH slightly favorable, though caution is warranted given recent volatility.

SOL: -0.5 — The significant decline in price and trading volume, along with weak sentiment, suggests reducing exposure to SOL, especially given its current bearish trend.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, DOGE remains neutral, warranting a hold position in the absence of clear directional signals.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current bearish market conditions and the need for stability, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2025-02-26 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as the U.S. imposing tariffs on the EU, which has impacted Bitcoin significantly. Despite this, there are signs of potential recovery in some assets, like Ethereum, where whale activity suggests confidence in a rebound. Solana is experiencing significant weakness, with a sharp decline in both price and trading volumes, indicating a lack of investor confidence. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether is facing legal challenges but continues to innovate with gas-free transfers on the Tron network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the recent price drop due to macroeconomic news, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, and there is potential for stabilization or recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale purchases during the sell-off indicate confidence, and the price is attempting a recovery, suggesting a potential bounce.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and trading volume drop signal weak sentiment and potential further downside, warranting reduced exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price action suggest a hold position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — With market uncertainty and bearish sentiment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-02-26 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. tariff announcements. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop due to geopolitical concerns, though on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum has shown signs of recovery after a whale purchase, indicating some confidence despite recent sell-offs. Solana is facing significant pressure, with trading volumes and prices hitting multi-month lows, reflecting weak sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news impact. Tether's legal challenges may affect its stability, but the upcoming ""Gas-Free"" transfers on Tron could boost its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain indicators suggest a potential bottom, and the overall market sentiment may stabilize. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale purchases indicate confidence, and the price is attempting recovery. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant declines in price and trading volume, coupled with weak sentiment, suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant changes in data or sentiment, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and legal uncertainties, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a safe haven."
2025-02-26 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously bearish, with significant price drops across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has faced a sharp decline due to geopolitical tensions, specifically U.S. tariff announcements, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum has seen notable whale accumulation despite recent price declines, indicating some underlying confidence. Solana is experiencing a significant downturn, with trading volumes plummeting and prices hitting multi-month lows. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether is embroiled in legal issues, although operational improvements are on the horizon with Tron. In this environment, maintaining a balanced approach with a slight defensive tilt seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and the market may stabilize. Maintain some exposure to capitalize on potential recovery.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation indicates confidence, and the price is attempting a recovery. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

SOL: -0.1 — Significant price drop and declining volumes suggest caution. Given the small current holding, reducing exposure is not possible, but avoid increasing allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of market volatility and bearish sentiment, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop due to geopolitical concerns, while Ethereum's price has been volatile despite some whale accumulation, indicating mixed confidence. Solana is facing a steep decline, exacerbated by reduced trading volumes and weak sentiment. DOGE lacks significant news, maintaining low activity levels. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with developments like Tron’s gas-free transfers potentially enhancing its utility. Overall, the market is experiencing heightened volatility and uncertainty, with a cautious outlook prevailing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some signs of a local bottom, the recent sharp price drop and lack of strong bullish indicators suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly is prudent given the current bearish sentiment.

ETH: +0.1 — While ETH has seen significant sell-offs, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound. A slight increase in allocation is justified by the possibility of recovery.

SOL: -0.5 — With SOL hitting a 5-month low and trading volumes plummeting, the asset appears unattractive in the current environment. Reducing exposure is advisable.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance on DOGE is appropriate.

USDT: +0.7 — In light of the bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity, especially with upcoming improvements in its transfer utility."
2025-02-26 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop due to geopolitical tensions, specifically U.S. tariff concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum, despite a steep decline, shows signs of recovery with significant whale purchases indicating confidence. Solana is notably weak, hitting a 5-month low with a dramatic drop in trading volumes, reflecting a lack of investor interest. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a downward trend. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with some positive developments in its ecosystem, such as the upcoming gas-free transfers on Tron, although legal issues persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent sharp decline, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and the price may stabilize or recover slightly. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale activity indicates confidence, and the price shows signs of recovery from overselling. Slightly increase exposure to capitalize on potential rebound.

SOL: -0.5 — With a significant drop in both price and trading volume, Solana appears weak. Reduce exposure given the lack of positive catalysts and poor sentiment.

DOGE: -0.3 — No significant news and continued price decline suggest reducing exposure to minimize potential losses.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-26 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. The macroeconomic context, with high volatility and geopolitical concerns such as U.S. tariffs, has contributed to this downturn. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop due to tariff concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum has seen interest from large investors despite its price dip, indicating possible confidence in a rebound. Solana is facing significant challenges with a dramatic drop in trading volumes and price, while Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a low activity level. Tether remains stable, with developments in the Tron ecosystem potentially enhancing its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, and there is potential for a rebound. The current portfolio holds BTC, and maintaining exposure could be beneficial if the market stabilizes.

ETH: +0.2 — The interest from whale investors during the sell-off indicates confidence in Ethereum's recovery potential. Holding ETH aligns with this sentiment, given the current portfolio's significant ETH exposure.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's sharp decline in trading volumes and price suggests continued weakness. With minimal holdings in the portfolio, reducing exposure aligns with the current bearish sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance. Maintaining current holdings without increasing exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-26 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be bearish, with significant price drops across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline due to geopolitical concerns, specifically U.S. tariff announcements, but on-chain data suggests a potential local bottom. Ethereum has seen a large sell-off but is showing signs of recovery, bolstered by whale activity. Solana is under pressure, hitting a multi-month low with drastically reduced trading volumes, indicating weak market confidence. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet with no significant news, while Tether's legal issues could impact its stability, though its role as a stablecoin remains crucial in volatile conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain indicators suggest a potential bottom, and the asset remains a key portfolio component. However, caution is warranted due to macroeconomic uncertainties.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation and signs of price recovery provide a modestly positive outlook, though recent volatility suggests maintaining a balanced approach.

SOL: -0.1 — Continued weakness and low trading volumes suggest caution, but given the small current holding, a slight reduction is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining the current position is appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of market volatility and bearish sentiment, increasing stablecoin exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-26 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as the U.S. imposing tariffs on the EU, which has negatively impacted Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent sharp decline suggests a potential local bottom, as indicated by significant on-chain activity from short-term holders. Ethereum shows signs of recovery with notable whale purchases, indicating some confidence despite recent volatility. Solana is experiencing a significant downturn, with a sharp drop in both price and trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but shows a slight recovery in price. Tether remains stable, with developments in the Tron network potentially enhancing its utility, although legal challenges persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain indicators suggest a potential bottom, and the market may stabilize, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale purchases indicate confidence, and the price recovery attempts suggest potential upside, making it relatively attractive.

SOL: -0.1 — Significant price and volume declines indicate weak sentiment; however, given the minimal current holding, a slight reduction is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price movements suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent to hedge against volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as U.S. tariff announcements. Despite this, there are signs of potential stabilization, with on-chain indicators suggesting a local bottom for BTC and significant whale purchases indicating confidence in ETH. SOL has experienced a sharp decline, hitting a five-month low, reflecting weak market sentiment and reduced trading volumes. DOGE lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. USDT remains stable, with developments in transfer mechanisms potentially enhancing its utility, although legal challenges may pose risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops due to macroeconomic factors, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, and the market may stabilize.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale purchases indicate strong confidence, and the price is attempting a recovery, suggesting a potential bounce back.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price drop and reduced trading volumes indicate weak sentiment, warranting caution despite holding a minimal position.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data keeps DOGE in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.1 — While stable, the potential for improved transfer mechanisms slightly enhances its attractiveness as a safe haven amidst market volatility."
2025-02-26 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently cautious, with significant volatility and recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop due to geopolitical concerns, specifically U.S. tariff announcements, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum has seen significant whale accumulation despite recent price dips, indicating confidence among large holders. Solana is facing a severe downturn, with trading volumes plummeting and prices hitting multi-month lows. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a relatively stable position. Meanwhile, Tether is involved in legal disputes, but its role as a stablecoin remains crucial in a volatile market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and the asset remains a key portfolio component amid uncertainty.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and a potential price recovery signal confidence, making ETH relatively attractive compared to other assets.

SOL: -0.1 — Significant price and volume declines indicate caution, but the minimal current holding suggests limited downside risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical signals keeps DOGE in a neutral position, with no immediate need for adjustment.

USDT: +0.2 — Given market volatility and geopolitical concerns, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against further downturns."
2025-02-27 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has also seen a substantial drop, breaking key support levels, which reinforces a bearish outlook. Solana has plunged significantly, hitting multi-month lows, with technical patterns suggesting further downside risk. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether has seen large outflows, indicating a shift towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by high volatility and potential trade tensions, adds to the uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sharp sell-off and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate further downside risk.

ETH: -0.4 — Breaking key support levels and bearish technical indicators indicate a need to reduce holdings amid continued pressure.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and potential for further declines warrant caution, though current holdings are minimal.

DOGE: -0.2 — Decreased investor interest and legal issues suggest a cautious approach, though maintaining some exposure due to existing holdings.

USDT: +0.4 — Despite large outflows, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent in a bearish market to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-27 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is predominantly bearish across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic pressures and specific negative developments for each asset. Bitcoin has experienced its largest sell-off since late 2022, influenced by tightening fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has suffered a significant crash, with potential for further declines if critical support fails. Dogecoin faces declining interest and legal challenges, while Tether is seeing large outflows, indicating a shift in liquidity preferences amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent significant sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to manage downside risk.

ETH: -0.4 — Breaking key support levels and ongoing bearish sentiment warrant a cautious approach, reducing exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent sharp declines, the potential for further downside is balanced by already low holdings, suggesting a hold position.

DOGE: -0.3 — Declining interest and legal challenges create a negative outlook, justifying a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure is prudent to preserve capital and manage volatility."
2025-02-27 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a relatively high U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, which may contribute to cautious investor sentiment in the crypto market. Recent market data shows mixed signals, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant sell-off and Ethereum breaking key support levels, indicating bearish sentiment. Solana has also seen a substantial decline, driven by broader market pressures and specific asset concerns. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing significant outflows, suggesting a potential market rotation towards decentralized platforms. Overall, the market sentiment is bearish, with investors appearing risk-averse and cautious.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite a recent price increase, Bitcoin's significant sell-off and weakened institutional demand suggest a bearish outlook. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market sentiment.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's break below key support levels and bearish technical signals indicate potential further downside. Reducing exposure aligns with the negative sentiment.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana has experienced a sharp decline, the recent price increase and bullish momentum signal suggest a cautious increase in exposure, given its potential for recovery.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin's reduced trading volume and legal scrutiny create uncertainty, warranting a reduction in exposure to mitigate potential risks.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer, especially amid significant outflows from centralized exchanges."
2025-02-27 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant sell-offs observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day decline since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has also faced a substantial drop, breaking critical support levels and reinforcing bearish expectations. Solana has seen a dramatic 50% decline from its January peaks, with analysts warning of potential further declines. Dogecoin's trading volume and open interest have significantly decreased, reflecting waning investor interest, compounded by legal scrutiny around Musk-linked operations. In contrast, Tether has seen large outflows from centralized exchanges, indicating a possible market rotation towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some stabilization, Bitcoin's recent sharp decline and lack of bullish signals suggest a cautious approach, maintaining a reduced exposure.

ETH: -0.6 — Ethereum's technical breakdown and bearish sentiment indicate further downside risk, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's significant price drop and potential for further declines suggest maintaining a cautious stance, though some bullish momentum is present.

DOGE: -0.4 — With declining open interest and legal challenges, Dogecoin faces headwinds, justifying a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-27 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and bearish sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant three-day sell-off, the largest since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has also faced substantial downward pressure, breaking key support levels and reinforcing bearish expectations. Solana has suffered a dramatic decline, losing over 50% from its January peaks, with technical patterns suggesting potential further downside. Dogecoin is experiencing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing significant outflows, indicating a possible market rotation toward decentralized platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite recent price increases, the overall bearish sentiment and significant sell-off suggest caution. Maintain reduced exposure due to the potential for further downside.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued bearish sentiment and technical breakdowns warrant a cautious approach. Reduce exposure slightly to manage risk.

SOL: -0.2 — Although there is some bullish momentum, the recent severe price drop and negative news suggest maintaining a cautious stance with reduced exposure.

DOGE: -0.4 — Legal scrutiny and declining investor interest indicate potential risks. Reduce exposure to manage potential downside.

USDT: +0.4 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity, especially with signs of capital rotation into decentralized platforms."
2025-02-27 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum due to macroeconomic pressures, including tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, while Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has also seen a sharp decline, influenced by broader risk-off pressures and specific memecoin-related issues. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is experiencing large outflows, indicating a potential market rotation towards decentralized platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price increases, the overall sentiment remains bearish due to the significant sell-off and macroeconomic pressures. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's technical breakdown and bearish sentiment suggest further downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market conditions.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana has shown some price recovery, the risk of further declines remains high. Maintain current exposure until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: -0.2 — With declining open interest and legal issues surrounding Musk-linked operations, Dogecoin's outlook is uncertain. A slight reduction in holdings is advisable.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is wise to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant sell-offs observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day decline since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has also faced a sharp decline, breaking key support levels and reinforcing bearish sentiment. Solana has been hit hard, crashing over 50% from its January peaks, with analysts warning of further potential declines. Dogecoin is seeing reduced investor interest and legal scrutiny, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential shift of liquidity towards decentralized platforms amid the broader market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the recent sharp sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest further downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent given current holdings.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's break below key support levels and ongoing bearish sentiment warrant a cautious approach. Reducing exposure aligns with the current market outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana has faced a significant decline, its recent price movements suggest potential stabilization. A slight increase in allocation could capture any rebound, but caution is advised.

DOGE: -0.4 — With declining open interest, trading volume, and legal challenges, Dogecoin's outlook is weak. Reducing exposure is advisable given the current holdings.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-27 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant downward pressure on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has also broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has seen a dramatic drop, exacerbated by a memecoin crash and broader risk-off sentiment, with technical patterns suggesting further downside. Dogecoin faces declining investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is experiencing large outflows, indicating a potential market rotation towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some stabilization, Bitcoin's recent sharp sell-off and lack of buy signals suggest a cautious approach, with potential for further downside.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's break below key support levels and bearish sentiment warrant a reduction in exposure, despite some bullish momentum signals.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's significant price drop and technical warnings of further declines suggest reducing exposure, even with some bullish momentum.

DOGE: -0.2 — Declining open interest and legal issues around Musk-linked operations indicate a need to reduce exposure, despite bullish momentum signals.

USDT: +0.4 — With market uncertainty and large outflows from centralized exchanges, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential opportunities."
2025-02-27 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic pressures and liquidity concerns. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day decline since late 2022, while Ethereum has broken critical support levels, reinforcing bearish expectations. Solana has also seen a substantial drop, exacerbated by a memecoin crash and risk-off sentiment. Dogecoin faces declining investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing large outflows as capital rotates amid the broader downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent sharp sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest caution. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.6 — Ethereum's technical breakdown and bearish sentiment indicate further downside potential. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market environment.

SOL: -0.4 — Although there is bullish momentum, the significant recent decline and potential for further drops warrant a cautious approach. Reduce exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: -0.3 — The decline in open interest and trading volume, coupled with legal scrutiny, suggests a weakening outlook. Reducing holdings is advisable.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher stablecoin exposure is beneficial for capital preservation and potential future opportunities."
2025-02-27 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has seen a dramatic 50% drop from its January peaks, with further declines possible if critical support levels fail. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a market rotation towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the recent sell-off, Bitcoin's on-chain activity remains low, and macroeconomic pressures persist. Holding a small position while monitoring for stabilization.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's technical breakdown and bearish sentiment suggest further downside risk. Reducing exposure due to the recent breach of key support levels.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's significant price drop and potential for further declines warrant a cautious approach. Reducing exposure given the risk of additional losses.

DOGE: -0.2 — Legal issues and declining interest in Dogecoin suggest limited upside. Reducing exposure slightly while monitoring for any positive developments.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity to capitalize on future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant downward pressure on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has broken critical support levels, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Solana has seen a dramatic 50% drop from its January peaks, with analysts warning of further declines. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, suggesting a shift in liquidity towards decentralized platforms amid the broader downturn. The macroeconomic context, with high volatility and uncertain geopolitical tensions, adds to the cautious market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent sharp sell-off and weakened institutional demand suggest caution. Holding BTC but reducing exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.7 — Breaking key support levels and significant sell pressure indicate a bearish trend. Reducing exposure due to continued downside risk.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent crash and potential for further declines warrant a cautious approach. Reducing exposure while monitoring for stabilization.

DOGE: -0.2 — Legal scrutiny and reduced trading activity suggest waning investor interest. Reducing exposure slightly.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins is prudent. Large outflows indicate liquidity shifts, but USDT remains a safe haven."
2025-02-27 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum due to macroeconomic pressures and liquidity constraints. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, while Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish expectations. Solana has also seen a sharp decline, exacerbated by broader risk-off sentiment and a memecoin crash. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, further dampening its outlook. Meanwhile, Tether is experiencing large outflows, indicating a shift of liquidity towards decentralized platforms amid the market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent sharp sell-off and weakened institutional demand suggest further downside risk.

ETH: -0.6 — Breaking key support levels and triggering significant liquidations, Ethereum faces continued bearish pressure.

SOL: -0.7 — The substantial price drop and potential for further declines make Solana less attractive in the current environment.

DOGE: -0.3 — Declining open interest and legal issues surrounding Elon Musk's involvement create a negative outlook for Dogecoin.

USDT: +0.5 — With the current bearish market sentiment, maintaining liquidity in USDT is prudent as capital rotates out of riskier assets."
2025-02-27 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by significant sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day decline since late 2022, with a 12.6% drop, largely due to tightening fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish expectations. Solana has seen a dramatic 50% decline from its January peaks, with technical patterns suggesting further downside risk. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential shift towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite technical buy signals, the significant recent sell-off and weakened institutional demand suggest caution. Reducing exposure is prudent given the bearish macro backdrop.

ETH: -0.7 — Breaking key support levels and triggering significant liquidations indicate strong bearish sentiment. Reducing exposure is advisable as downside risks remain high.

SOL: -0.8 — The sharp decline and potential for further drops, as indicated by technical patterns, warrant a reduction in exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.3 — With declining open interest and legal scrutiny, reducing exposure is sensible amidst fading investor attention and potential legal challenges.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity amid capital rotation out of riskier assets."
2025-02-27 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant downward pressure across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Solana has seen a dramatic 50% drop from its January peaks, with analysts warning of further declines. Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest and legal scrutiny, while Tether is seeing large outflows, suggesting a shift towards decentralized platforms amidst the downturn. The macroeconomic context, with high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, adds further pressure to the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite technical buy signals, the recent sharp sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest caution. No current holdings, so no reduction.

ETH: -0.3 — Breaking key support levels and bearish news indicate potential further downside. Small existing position, so a cautious stance is warranted.

SOL: -0.7 — Significant price drop and bearish chart patterns suggest further declines. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — Declining interest and legal issues create a negative outlook. Current holdings should be reduced.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining liquidity in stablecoins is prudent. Large outflows suggest potential buying opportunities in the future."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies driven by macroeconomic pressures and specific asset-related issues. Bitcoin has experienced its largest sell-off since late 2022, exacerbated by tightening fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has broken critical support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has seen a dramatic drop, influenced by a memecoin crash and broader risk-off sentiment, with further downside potential flagged by analysts. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges related to Musk-linked operations. Meanwhile, Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a shift in liquidity towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the recent sell-off, BTC's technical indicators remain bullish, suggesting potential stabilization. However, macroeconomic pressures warrant caution.

ETH: -0.5 — Breaking key support levels and bearish news sentiment indicate further downside risk, justifying a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and bearish chart patterns suggest caution, though some technical indicators remain positive.

DOGE: -0.4 — Declining open interest and legal scrutiny create a negative outlook, warranting reduced exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — With market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-27 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by significant sell-offs in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have experienced notable declines due to tightening fiat liquidity and macroeconomic pressures. Solana has faced a dramatic drop, exacerbated by a memecoin crash and risk-off sentiment, while Dogecoin is experiencing reduced investor interest and legal challenges. Despite the downturn, USDT remains relatively stable, though there are indications of liquidity moving towards decentralized platforms. Overall, the market is characterized by heightened volatility and a cautious stance among investors.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite recent bullish technical indicators, the significant sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest further downside risk. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate potential losses.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's break below key support levels and bearish technical signals warrant a cautious approach. Reducing exposure is advisable given the potential for continued downside.

SOL: -0.7 — Solana's sharp decline and potential for further drops highlight significant risk. Reducing exposure is prudent to protect against further losses.

DOGE: -0.3 — With declining open interest and legal scrutiny, Dogecoin's outlook is uncertain. A slight reduction in holdings is recommended to manage risk.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining or slightly increasing USDT exposure provides stability and liquidity, allowing for flexibility in future allocations."
2025-02-27 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant downward pressure observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp three-day sell-off, marking its largest decline since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has also seen a notable drop after breaking a key support level, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Solana has crashed significantly, with analysts warning of potential further declines. Dogecoin is facing decreased investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential market rotation towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.5** — Recent significant sell-off and weakened institutional demand suggest further downside risk. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate potential losses.

**ETH: -0.3** — Breaking key support levels and bearish technical indicators point to continued downside pressure. Reduce exposure slightly.

**SOL: -0.6** — With a major crash and warnings of further declines, Solana's risk profile is elevated. Current holdings should be reduced significantly.

**DOGE: -0.4** — Decreased trading volume and legal scrutiny contribute to a negative outlook. Reduce exposure given the fading investor interest.

**USDT: +0.8** — In a bearish market environment, increasing USDT holdings provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer, especially with observed stablecoin outflows."
2025-02-27 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic pressures and specific asset-related issues. Bitcoin has experienced its largest sell-off since late 2022, indicating a tightening of fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has seen a dramatic crash, with potential for further declines, while Dogecoin faces reduced investor interest and legal challenges. Tether is experiencing outflows, suggesting a shift towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sharp sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach, despite some stabilization in price.

ETH: -0.7 — Breaking key support levels and continued bearish sentiment warrant reducing exposure, especially given the macro pressures.

SOL: -0.8 — The significant price drop and potential for further declines make it prudent to reduce holdings, as the risk remains high.

DOGE: -0.6 — Decreased investor interest and legal scrutiny indicate a need to reduce exposure, despite holding a small position.

USDT: +0.6 — With the broader market downturn, maintaining higher USDT exposure is advisable to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-27 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant downward pressure on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has also faced a steep decline, exacerbated by broader risk-off sentiment and specific market events. Dogecoin is seeing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, further dampening its outlook. Meanwhile, USDT is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential shift in liquidity towards decentralized platforms amidst the broader market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent sharp sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest continued downside risk. Holding a small position, but reducing exposure is prudent given current market conditions.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite recent price recovery, bearish technical breakdowns and macro pressures keep the outlook uncertain. Maintaining a neutral stance due to lack of holdings.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price decline and bearish chart patterns indicate further downside potential. Reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — Declining open interest and legal issues surrounding DOGE reduce its attractiveness. Reducing exposure due to current holdings.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2025-02-27 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant downward pressure observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Solana has suffered a dramatic decline, exacerbated by memecoin volatility and broader market risk aversion. Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest and legal challenges, further dampening its outlook. Meanwhile, Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential shift in liquidity towards decentralized platforms amidst the broader market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sharp sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest continued downside risk. Holding a small position, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the recent plunge and bearish technicals, the absence of a current holding means no reduction is possible. Monitoring for stabilization.

SOL: -0.7 — With a significant price crash and bearish outlook, reducing exposure is advisable to mitigate further losses.

DOGE: -0.3 — Declining open interest and legal issues suggest a cautious approach. Reducing exposure aligns with the current negative sentiment.

USDT: +0.5 — Amidst market volatility and outflows, maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin exposure provides a defensive hedge against further market declines."
2025-02-27 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and significant declines in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, reflecting tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken a key support level, reinforcing bearish expectations. Solana has seen a dramatic 50% drop from its January peaks, with analysts warning of further declines. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal scrutiny, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential market rotation towards decentralized platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sharp sell-off and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure, despite some stabilization amid trade-tariff tensions.

ETH: 0.0 — While Ethereum has broken key support levels, the absence of a current position and mixed technical signals warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the significant price drop, the potential for further declines and lack of current holdings suggest maintaining a neutral position.

DOGE: -0.3 — The decline in open interest and trading volume, coupled with legal issues, suggest reducing exposure to DOGE holdings.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of the bearish market conditions and significant outflows from other cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher USDT allocation is prudent for capital preservation."
