2025-02-21 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious due to a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin dropping from around $100k to near $97k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. The hack has raised concerns about security and regulatory oversight in the crypto space. Despite the negative news, Solana has shown resilience with institutional interest indicated by Franklin Templeton's ETF filing, although its network throughput has been under pressure. Dogecoin has seen increased activity due to a large whale transfer, raising concerns about potential sell pressure. Tether remains stable, expanding its operations into Africa amidst global regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent sell-off due to the Bybit hack, BTC maintains strong technical signals with bullish momentum and high on-chain activity, suggesting a potential recovery.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing downward pressure from the hack, but its technical indicators remain neutral. The lack of bullish momentum suggests holding rather than increasing exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana benefits from positive institutional interest with the ETF filing, and its technical indicators show bullish momentum, making it relatively attractive despite network issues.

DOGE: -0.1 — Concerns over potential sell pressure from a large whale transfer to Binance warrant caution, but the overall sentiment remains neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the market's cautious sentiment and the need for liquidity, maintaining a higher USDT allocation is prudent, but some capital rotation into other assets is advisable."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily due to the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been particularly affected, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable drop from its recent highs and Ethereum facing regulatory concerns following the largest-ever ETH theft. Despite these challenges, Solana has shown resilience with institutional interest, as evidenced by Franklin Templeton's ETF filing, although it has faced some network throughput issues. Dogecoin is experiencing potential sell pressure due to large whale movements, while Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amid regulatory pressures in the US and EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite strong on-chain activity and technical buy signals, the recent Bybit hack has created significant downward pressure and uncertainty, warranting a cautious stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum faces mixed signals with technical buy indicators but is overshadowed by the recent hack and regulatory concerns, suggesting a neutral position.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana benefits from institutional interest and positive technical indicators, making it relatively attractive despite network issues.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale transfer to Binance introduces uncertainty, but without clear technical or sentiment shifts, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven."
2025-02-21 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautious, primarily due to the recent $1.5 billion hack at Bybit, which has caused significant downward pressure on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This incident has led to increased volatility and a sell-off in the market, overshadowing positive developments such as Coinbase's legal relief. Solana shows potential institutional interest with Franklin Templeton's ETF filing, although it faces network throughput issues. Dogecoin is experiencing community concerns due to a large whale transfer, while Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amidst regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent hack and subsequent market sell-off create a bearish outlook. Holding a small position, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: 0.0 — The significant drop due to the Bybit hack and lack of bullish momentum suggests a neutral stance. No current holdings, so no need to reduce exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Institutional interest from the ETF filing is a positive sign, but network issues and price pressure warrant a cautious approach. Maintain current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale transfer raises concerns about potential sell pressure, but no current holdings mean no need to adjust exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to preserve capital."
2025-02-21 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The crypto market is experiencing heightened volatility due to a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both been negatively impacted, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable drop from around $100k to near $97k, and Ethereum falling below $2,700. The hack has sparked concerns over security and regulatory oversight, particularly affecting sentiment towards Ethereum. Solana, despite facing pressure from network throughput issues, has seen institutional interest with a new ETF filing by Franklin Templeton. Dogecoin is facing potential sell pressure due to a large whale transfer to Binance. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amidst global regulatory challenges, maintaining its stability as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a buy signal from technical indicators, the recent hack-induced sell-off and liquidation events suggest caution. Current holdings should be reduced slightly to manage risk.

ETH: 0.0 — The significant price drop due to the Bybit hack and lack of bullish momentum signals a neutral stance. No current holdings to reduce.

SOL: +0.2 — Although facing network issues, the ETF filing indicates positive institutional interest, warranting a modest increase in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Potential sell pressure from whale activity is balanced by bullish momentum signals, suggesting a hold strategy with no current holdings to reduce.

USDT: +0.5 — With increased market volatility and security concerns, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against further market downturns."
2025-02-21 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautious due to the recent $1.5B hack at Bybit, which has caused significant sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. This incident has overshadowed positive developments such as Coinbase's legal relief and Franklin Templeton's Solana ETF filing. Despite these setbacks, there are signs of institutional interest in Solana and strategic expansions by Tether, indicating potential long-term bullish trends. However, the immediate market environment remains volatile and risk-averse, with a preference for stability and safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite strong on-chain activity, the recent Bybit hack has created significant downward pressure, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — The hack has severely impacted Ethereum, but the absence of a current position and potential for recovery suggests a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest from the Franklin Templeton ETF filing and strong technical indicators support a positive outlook despite recent network issues.

DOGE: -0.1 — The whale transfer to Binance suggests potential sell pressure, but without a current position, the impact is limited.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market volatility and risk aversion, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins provides a buffer against further downturns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, primarily influenced by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This incident has heightened market volatility and triggered liquidations, overshadowing any positive news, such as Coinbase's legal relief. Solana, despite institutional interest indicated by the ETF filing, is under pressure due to network issues and broader market conditions. Dogecoin faces potential sell pressure due to large whale movements, while Tether remains stable, expanding its operations in Africa amidst regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent hack at Bybit has significantly impacted Bitcoin's price, and the lack of bullish momentum suggests caution. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market instability.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit hack, with no clear bullish signals. Holding a neutral position is advisable until market conditions stabilize.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the broader market downturn, institutional interest via the ETF filing provides some support for Solana. However, network issues limit the upside potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale transfer to Binance introduces uncertainty, but without holding DOGE, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of the current bearish market sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity, especially as Tether expands its market presence."
2025-02-21 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently cautious, influenced by a significant security breach at Bybit, which led to a sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced notable declines due to the hack, with Bitcoin dropping from around $100k to near $97k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. Despite these setbacks, some positive developments are emerging, such as Franklin Templeton's filing for a Solana ETF, indicating institutional interest. However, Solana's network is under pressure, and Dogecoin faces potential sell pressure from large whale movements. Tether remains stable, expanding its operations in Africa amidst global regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The Bybit hack has negatively impacted Bitcoin's price, and despite some buy signals, the overall market sentiment remains cautious. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current volatility.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit breach, but the bullish momentum signal suggests some resilience. A neutral stance is appropriate until further clarity emerges.

SOL: +0.5 — Despite network pressure, the filing for a Solana ETF by Franklin Templeton is a positive sign of institutional interest. This could support price recovery, warranting increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is potential sell pressure from whale movements, the overall impact on price has been minimal. Maintaining a neutral position is advisable.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of recent market volatility and the need for stability, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is beneficial to manage risk and preserve capital."
2025-02-21 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines due to the hack, with Bitcoin dropping from around $100k to near $97k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. This incident has overshadowed positive news such as Coinbase's legal relief. Solana has seen some institutional interest with Franklin Templeton's ETF filing, but its network throughput issues and price drop due to meme coin controversies have added pressure. Dogecoin faces potential sell pressure due to a large whale transfer to Binance. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding into Africa amid regulatory challenges in the US and EU, maintaining its stability as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The Bybit hack has caused a significant drop in Bitcoin's price and market sentiment, overshadowing any positive news. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the bearish news from the Bybit hack, Ethereum's technical indicators show bullish momentum. However, the hack's impact warrants a neutral stance until stability returns.

SOL: +0.2 — Institutional interest from the ETF filing is a positive sign, but network issues and price pressure suggest a cautious increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale transfer to Binance introduces uncertainty, but without current holdings, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and ongoing regulatory pressures, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity."
2025-02-21 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is under pressure from the Bybit hack, and while momentum remains positive, the overall sentiment is mixed due to regulatory concerns.

SOL: +0.5 — Institutional interest via the ETF filing and positive momentum signals suggest potential upside, despite network throughput issues.

DOGE: 0.0 — The whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential sell pressure, but no immediate action is warranted without further developments.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious following a significant security breach at Bybit, which led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced price declines due to the hack, with Bitcoin dropping from around $100k to near $97k and Ethereum falling below $2,700. Despite this, Ethereum shows signs of recovery with bullish momentum and a potential breakout. Solana, while affected by network throughput issues, is buoyed by institutional interest as evidenced by Franklin Templeton's ETF filing. Dogecoin's market is jittery due to large whale movements, while Tether is expanding its operations in Africa amidst regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent Bybit hack has created downward pressure on Bitcoin, and while there is some buy signal from trend indicators, the overall sentiment remains cautious.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite the initial drop due to the hack, Ethereum is showing signs of recovery with bullish momentum and a potential breakout above the Bollinger Bands.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest from the Franklin Templeton ETF filing provides a positive outlook, despite recent network issues and price pressure.

DOGE: 0.0 — The market is cautious due to significant whale activity, but no strong technical or sentiment changes justify a directional move.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and recent sell-offs in major cryptocurrencies, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven while the market stabilizes."
2025-02-21 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious following a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite some positive developments, such as Coinbase's legal relief and institutional interest in Solana, the market is overshadowed by the hack's impact. Ethereum and Solana have shown signs of recovery with bullish technical signals, while Bitcoin remains under pressure. Dogecoin's market activity is influenced by large whale movements, and Tether continues to expand its operations amidst regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a buy signal from trend indicators, the recent hack and subsequent sell-off create a bearish sentiment, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite the initial drop due to the hack, Ethereum's recovery in price and strong bullish momentum signal a potential rebound, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Institutional interest and positive technical indicators suggest a favorable outlook for Solana, supporting an increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is some bullish momentum, the potential sell pressure from whale activity creates uncertainty, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and the need for stability, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT is prudent to manage risk."
2025-02-21 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently cautious, primarily due to the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite some positive developments, such as Coinbase's legal relief and Franklin Templeton's interest in a Solana ETF, the market is overshadowed by the repercussions of the hack. This has resulted in increased volatility and regulatory concerns, particularly affecting Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana shows signs of institutional interest, but its network performance issues and price pressure are concerning. Dogecoin's market is jittery due to large whale movements, while Tether remains stable, expanding its operations in Africa amidst regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The Bybit hack has caused significant sell pressure and increased volatility, overshadowing positive news like Coinbase's legal relief. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum is under pressure from the Bybit hack, with regulatory concerns adding to the negative sentiment. Despite some bullish technical signals, the overall environment suggests caution.

SOL: +0.2 — Institutional interest from Franklin Templeton is a positive sign, but network performance issues and price pressure warrant a cautious approach. Slight increase in allocation due to potential long-term interest.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum, the large whale transfer to Binance introduces uncertainty and potential sell pressure, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market volatility and regulatory concerns, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven, balancing the portfolio amidst uncertainty."
2025-02-21 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is mixed with a bearish tilt due to the recent $1.5B hack at Bybit, which has impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a buy signal from technical indicators, the recent hack has led to significant sell pressure and market uncertainty, warranting a cautious stance.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is under pressure from the Bybit hack and regulatory concerns, overshadowing its bullish technical signals. Reducing exposure is prudent.

SOL: +0.3 — Institutional interest via the ETF filing is a positive signal, though recent network issues and price pressure suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is potential sell pressure from whale activity, there are no significant changes in market data or sentiment to justify a directional move.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic despite recent volatility triggered by a significant security breach at Bybit, which affected Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. The hack led to substantial liquidations, yet the market has shown resilience with a recovery in prices and positive technical indicators for most assets. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing increased institutional interest, with Solana seeing a potential boost from ETF filings. Meanwhile, Dogecoin faces potential sell pressure due to large whale movements, and Tether is expanding its presence in Africa amidst regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent hack-related dip, Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery with strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity, suggesting a cautious buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's price is rebounding after the Bybit incident, supported by bullish momentum indicators. However, regulatory concerns from the hack keep the score moderate.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana benefits from institutional interest via ETF filings and strong technical signals, making it an attractive asset despite recent network issues.

DOGE: 0.0 — Potential sell pressure from whale activity creates uncertainty, balancing out the positive technical signals and resulting in a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With improving market sentiment and increased risk appetite, there's a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has negatively impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. The hack has led to substantial liquidations and increased volatility, overshadowing positive news such as Coinbase's legal relief. Ethereum is particularly under pressure due to being part of the largest crypto hack ever, which raises regulatory concerns. Solana, despite facing network throughput issues, has seen some institutional interest with the filing of a Solana ETF by Franklin Templeton. Dogecoin is experiencing potential sell pressure due to a large whale transfer to Binance. Meanwhile, Tether is expanding its operations in Africa, indicating a strategic pivot amid regulatory challenges in the US and EU.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some technical buy signals, the recent hack-induced sell-off and liquidation risks warrant a cautious approach, especially given current holdings.

ETH: -0.4 — The significant price drop and regulatory concerns following the Bybit hack suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

SOL: +0.2 — Institutional interest via the ETF filing provides a positive outlook, although network issues and price pressure limit the score.

DOGE: 0.0 — The whale transfer to Binance introduces uncertainty, but without current holdings, a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher USDT allocation for stability and potential re-entry opportunities is prudent."
2025-02-21 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This incident has overshadowed positive news, such as Coinbase's legal relief and Franklin Templeton's interest in Solana. Despite some technical indicators showing short-term buy signals, the recent hack has introduced heightened volatility and uncertainty, causing a flight to safety and increased scrutiny on exchange security. Tether remains stable, with its expansion into African markets indicating strategic growth amid regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some technical buy signals, the recent Bybit hack has introduced significant downside risk, and the market sentiment is negative. Holding BTC is risky in the current environment.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit hack, with a notable price drop and regulatory concerns. While there is some bullish momentum, the overall sentiment is bearish.

SOL: +0.2 — Institutional interest from Franklin Templeton is a positive sign, but the network's throughput issues and price pressure limit the upside. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — The whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential sell pressure, but there are no immediate changes in sentiment or technicals to justify a position.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and reduce exposure to riskier assets."
2025-02-21 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has affected major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This incident has caused a notable sell-off, leading to a drop in prices and increased volatility. Despite some positive developments, such as the SEC dropping its lawsuit against Coinbase and Franklin Templeton's interest in a Solana ETF, the market remains under pressure due to the hack and subsequent regulatory concerns. Tether's expansion into Africa highlights its strategic shift amid tightening regulations in the US and EU, indicating a cautious approach to maintaining stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The Bybit hack has led to a significant sell-off, overshadowing positive news about Coinbase. Despite some bullish technical signals, the overall sentiment is negative.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum has been heavily impacted by the Bybit hack, with a significant price drop and regulatory concerns. The bearish sentiment outweighs the technical buy signals.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the price pressure and network issues, the filing for a Solana ETF by Franklin Templeton suggests growing institutional interest, providing some support.

DOGE: 0.0 — The whale transfer to Binance raises concerns about potential sell pressure, but there is no significant change in market sentiment or technical indicators.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, maintaining a higher USDT exposure is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2025-02-21 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which resulted in a $1.5 billion hack. This event has led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, with both experiencing substantial price drops. The hack has also sparked regulatory concerns, particularly for Ethereum, which suffered the largest theft in its history. Solana, while experiencing a price decline, is seeing some positive institutional interest with the filing of a Solana ETF by Franklin Templeton. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is facing potential sell pressure due to a large whale transfer to Binance. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with Tether expanding its operations in Africa amidst global regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The Bybit hack has led to a significant sell-off and increased volatility, suggesting a cautious approach to Bitcoin in the short term.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is under pressure from the largest-ever theft, and regulatory concerns are likely to weigh on its price, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the price drop, the filing for a Solana ETF indicates potential institutional interest, providing a slight positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale transfer to Binance introduces uncertainty, but without holding DOGE, no action is necessary.

USDT: +0.7 — In light of the bearish market sentiment and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable price declines, exacerbated by the hack and subsequent liquidations. Despite some positive news, such as Coinbase's legal relief and Franklin Templeton's Solana ETF filing, the market is overshadowed by the security concerns and regulatory debates following the Bybit incident. Solana's network issues and Dogecoin's whale activity add to the uncertainty, while Tether's expansion into Africa highlights its strategic pivot amid regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The Bybit hack has triggered a significant sell-off, and Bitcoin's price is below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential further downside. Current holdings should be reduced in light of these risks.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit hack, with price declines and regulatory concerns. The lack of bullish signals suggests a cautious approach, reducing exposure slightly.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite price pressure, the ETF filing by Franklin Templeton indicates potential institutional interest, providing some support. Maintain a slight positive bias due to this long-term potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — The whale transfer to Binance creates uncertainty, but without current holdings, no action is needed. Maintain a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and mitigate risk, especially given the ongoing market volatility and security concerns."
2025-02-21 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by the significant $1.5 billion hack at Bybit, which has led to a sharp sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, exacerbated by the hack's impact on market confidence. Despite some positive news, such as Coinbase's legal relief and Franklin Templeton's interest in Solana, the market remains under pressure, with technical indicators showing breakdown signals for most assets. In this environment, risk aversion is high, and there is a tendency to seek safety in stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent hack has severely impacted Bitcoin's price, and technical indicators suggest further downside risk. Despite holding BTC, reducing exposure is prudent given the current market conditions.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit hack, with significant price declines and regulatory concerns. Reducing exposure is advisable until market conditions stabilize.

SOL: 0.0 — While Solana has institutional interest, the overall market pressure and network issues suggest a neutral stance. Holding current positions without increasing exposure is recommended.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the whale movement, there is no significant change in sentiment or technicals to warrant a position change. Maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.7 — In a risk-off environment, increasing exposure to USDT is sensible to preserve capital and mitigate volatility. The stablecoin's expansion into new markets also provides a slight positive outlook."
2025-02-21 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a widespread sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable declines due to the hack, with Bitcoin dropping from around $100k to near $97k, and Ethereum falling below $2,700. The hack has also fueled regulatory concerns, especially regarding exchange oversight. Solana has seen some institutional interest with a new ETF filing, but its network throughput issues and price decline indicate ongoing pressure. Dogecoin is experiencing potential sell pressure due to large whale movements, while Tether is expanding into African markets amidst global regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent hack at Bybit has led to significant sell-offs and increased volatility, suggesting a cautious approach despite the absence of a strong buy signal.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's price has been significantly impacted by the Bybit hack, and ongoing regulatory concerns add further downside risk.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the recent price drop and network issues, institutional interest via the ETF filing provides a slight positive outlook, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — The large whale transfer to Binance creates uncertainty, but there is no clear directional signal to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the current bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."
2025-02-21 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, primarily driven by the recent $1.5B hack at Bybit, which has caused significant sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This event has overshadowed positive news such as Coinbase's legal relief and Franklin Templeton's filing for a Solana ETF, indicating that security concerns are currently outweighing potential bullish catalysts. The market is experiencing heightened volatility, with technical indicators showing no clear buy signals, and most assets are trading below their lower Bollinger Bands, suggesting potential breakdowns. In this environment, maintaining a cautious approach with a preference for stable assets like USDT may be prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The Bybit hack has led to significant sell pressure and a bearish technical outlook, with Bitcoin trading below its lower Bollinger Band. Despite holding a small amount, reducing exposure is advisable given the current market conditions.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is similarly affected by the Bybit hack, with regulatory concerns adding to the negative sentiment. The lack of bullish technical signals supports a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana is under pressure, the ETF filing by Franklin Templeton indicates potential institutional interest. This, coupled with a relatively stable price despite market turmoil, warrants a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite increased on-chain activity, the lack of significant positive news or technical indicators suggests a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by the significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This incident has overshadowed positive developments like Coinbase's legal relief and Franklin Templeton's ETF filing for Solana. The market is experiencing heightened volatility, with technical indicators showing no clear buy signals and most assets trading below their lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential breakdowns. In such an environment, there is a tendency to seek safety in stable assets like USDT, especially as regulatory concerns and security issues heighten risk aversion.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The Bybit hack has significantly impacted Bitcoin's price, and technical indicators show no bullish signals. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit incident, with no positive technical indicators. Regulatory concerns further add to the bearish sentiment.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the overall bearish market, the ETF filing by Franklin Templeton indicates potential institutional interest, providing a slight positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although there was a significant whale transfer, no substantial market impact or technical signals suggest a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current risk-averse environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-21 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, primarily driven by the recent $1.5 billion hack at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This incident has led to significant sell-offs and increased volatility, overshadowing positive news such as Coinbase's legal relief. Ethereum and Bitcoin have experienced notable declines, while Solana faces pressure despite institutional interest due to network issues. Dogecoin is experiencing potential sell pressure from large whale movements, and Tether is expanding its operations amidst regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent Bybit hack has led to significant sell-offs and increased volatility, suggesting a cautious approach. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.4 — Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum is under pressure from the hack, with additional regulatory concerns. Reducing exposure is advisable given the current bearish sentiment.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite network issues, institutional interest via the ETF filing provides a slight positive outlook. Maintain current holdings with a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — The potential sell pressure from whale movements creates uncertainty, but without current holdings, no action is needed.

USDT: +0.7 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-02-22 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and a relatively high gold price, indicating a cautious but not overly bearish sentiment in broader markets. Bitcoin is experiencing a narrowing trading range, suggesting potential for a breakout, supported by institutional interest. Ethereum's recent price increase is driven by a supply squeeze following a major hack, with Bybit's buyback efforts further stabilizing the market. Solana is seeing bullish momentum due to significant whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative optimism, though the projections are highly speculative. Tether remains stable, with proactive measures against illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and potential breakout from a narrowing range suggest a moderate buy signal, though technical indicators remain neutral.

ETH: +0.4 — Recent price recovery due to supply constraints and buyback efforts provide a supportive backdrop, despite neutral technical signals.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and staking reinforce bullish sentiment, with recent price increases supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative optimism and recent price increases suggest a mild buy signal, though the lack of strong technical support tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential for bullish moves in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2025-02-22 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum has seen a price lift due to a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit's buyback efforts further stabilizing its price. Solana is buoyed by whale accumulation and staking activity, indicating positive momentum. Dogecoin is experiencing speculative optimism, though its price predictions are based on highly speculative scenarios. Meanwhile, Tether's active measures against illicit funds highlight its stability as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a moderate increase in allocation, despite current technical indicators not showing a buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — The supply squeeze and buyback efforts provide a short-term bullish outlook, though technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and staking activity indicate strong bullish momentum, warranting an increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative optimism and recent price increases suggest a slight positive bias, but caution is advised due to speculative nature.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the potential for bullish movements in other assets, reducing USDT exposure slightly to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities."
2025-02-22 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with signs of potential upward movement, particularly in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Institutional support and narrowing price ranges suggest a possible breakout for Bitcoin, while Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze due to the Bybit hack, leading to a short-term price recovery. Solana has seen positive momentum due to significant whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin remains speculative with bullish predictions, but lacks substantial data support. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and moderate volatility, supports a balanced approach, with a slight tilt towards risk assets given the current signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a moderate increase in allocation, despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals.

ETH: +0.3 — The supply squeeze and market stabilization efforts post-Bybit hack indicate a short-term positive outlook, warranting a cautious increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and staking activity provide strong bullish momentum, making Solana attractive for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish predictions, there is insufficient data support to justify a change in allocation. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish movements in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on risk asset opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with signs of potential upward movements. Bitcoin's sideways trading, coupled with institutional support, suggests a possible breakout, as noted by analysts. Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze following the Bybit hack, which has led to a short-term price recovery. Solana has seen a significant whale accumulation, reinforcing bullish momentum. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative optimism, although such projections remain highly speculative. Meanwhile, Tether's actions in freezing illicit funds highlight ongoing vigilance in the stablecoin market. The macroeconomic indicators show a stable environment with moderate volatility, which supports a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential for a breakout suggest a moderate increase in allocation, despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals.

ETH: +0.3 — The supply squeeze and Bybit's market-stabilizing actions create a favorable environment for Ethereum, warranting a slight increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and staking activity provide strong bullish momentum, making Solana an attractive asset to increase allocation.

DOGE: +0.1 — While speculative optimism is present, the lack of strong technical signals suggests only a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With the potential for bullish movements in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on risk-on opportunities."
2025-02-22 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong S&P 500 performance. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing a narrowing price range, suggesting potential breakouts, with Bitcoin seeing increased institutional interest and Ethereum facing a supply squeeze due to a recent hack. Solana has seen positive price action due to significant whale accumulation and staking, while Dogecoin has speculative bullish sentiment but lacks substantial technical support. Tether remains stable but has been active in freezing illicit funds, showing its role in maintaining market integrity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and the potential for a breakout suggest a moderate buy signal, despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals.

ETH: +0.3 — The supply squeeze and buyback by Bybit provide a short-term bullish outlook, though technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and staking have reinforced bullish momentum, making it relatively more attractive in the current market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish sentiment, the lack of strong technical indicators or substantial news keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential breakouts in major cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2025-02-22 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a potential for bullish momentum. Bitcoin's price has been trading within a narrowing range, suggesting a possible breakout, supported by institutional interest. Ethereum has experienced a supply squeeze due to a significant hack, with subsequent buybacks helping stabilize and slightly lift prices. Solana has seen whale accumulation, reinforcing a positive outlook. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative bullish predictions, although these are highly speculative. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its involvement in freezing illicit funds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and a potential breakout from a narrowing price range suggest a moderately bullish outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.4 — The supply squeeze and buyback following the Bybit hack have created a short-term bullish environment, though caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and staking indicate strong bullish sentiment, making Solana an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.2 — While speculative predictions are driving some optimism, the lack of substantial technical or on-chain support tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally optimistic market sentiment and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure seems prudent."

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing signs of potential upward momentum. Bitcoin's sideways trading is seen as healthy by institutional investors, suggesting a potential breakout. Ethereum's recent price increase is driven by a supply squeeze following the Bybit hack, with additional support from Bybit's buyback efforts. Solana benefits from significant whale accumulation, reinforcing its bullish momentum. Dogecoin has speculative bullish projections, but these are largely driven by sentiment rather than concrete market data. Tether's involvement in freezing illicit funds highlights its role in maintaining market integrity, but it remains a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a moderate increase in allocation, despite the lack of immediate buy signals in technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — The supply squeeze and Bybit's buyback provide a short-term bullish outlook, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and staking activity indicate strong bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish sentiment and speculative projections, the lack of strong technical or on-chain signals suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With positive signals in other assets and a generally optimistic market sentiment, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and a relatively high S&P 500, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing a narrowing price range, hinting at potential breakouts. Bitcoin's institutional support and Ethereum's supply squeeze due to the Bybit hack are notable bullish factors. Solana is seeing positive momentum from whale accumulation and staking activities. Dogecoin's speculative projections are generating interest, though they remain highly speculative. Tether's active measures against illicit funds highlight its role in maintaining market stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a positive outlook, though the technical indicators remain mixed.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and buyback post-Bybit hack provide a bullish sentiment, supported by positive momentum signals.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking activities are reinforcing bullish momentum, making it relatively attractive.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative interest and bullish predictions provide a slight positive bias, but the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — While USDT remains a safe haven, the potential for breakouts in other assets suggests a slight rotation out of stablecoins to capitalize on risk opportunities."
2025-02-22 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish undertone. Bitcoin is experiencing a narrowing price range, suggesting a potential breakout, supported by growing institutional adoption. Ethereum faces a supply squeeze due to the Bybit hack, which has led to a short-term price recovery. Solana has seen positive momentum from whale accumulation and staking activities. Dogecoin's sentiment is speculative but optimistic, driven by bullish predictions. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with recent actions showcasing its role in maintaining market integrity amid illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a moderate bullish outlook, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — The supply squeeze and Bybit's buyback efforts provide a short-term bullish sentiment, justifying a slight increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and staking activities reinforce bullish momentum, making it an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish predictions, there is no substantial data-driven momentum, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure to reallocate capital into more promising opportunities is advisable."
2025-02-22 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several indicators pointing towards potential bullish movements. Bitcoin's sideways trading pattern is seen as healthy by institutional investors, hinting at a possible breakout. Ethereum has experienced a supply squeeze due to the Bybit hack, leading to a price increase, while Solana's price has been buoyed by significant whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin has speculative bullish sentiment, although it's largely driven by optimistic projections rather than concrete developments. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a relatively high S&P 500, supports a moderate risk-on sentiment, though the elevated VIX suggests some caution remains. Tether's actions in freezing funds tied to illicit activities highlight ongoing vigilance in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional interest and potential for a breakout suggest a positive outlook, although the lack of a clear trend signal tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and proactive market stabilization efforts by Bybit create a favorable environment for price appreciation.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong whale activity and staking reinforce bullish momentum, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.1 — While speculative sentiment is positive, the lack of substantial developments limits the strength of the buy signal.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall positive sentiment and potential for bullish movements in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2025-02-22 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 18.47. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which could influence crypto markets by exerting some downward pressure on prices. However, the crypto market shows signs of bullish momentum across major assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL, supported by institutional interest and significant on-chain activities. Bitcoin's sideways trading and potential breakout, along with Ethereum's supply squeeze post-Bybit hack, are key narratives driving positive sentiment. Solana's whale accumulation further reinforces its bullish outlook. Meanwhile, Dogecoin's speculative projections have not translated into immediate market activity, and USDT remains a safe haven amid these dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite the lack of a short-term trend signal.

ETH: +0.5 — The supply squeeze due to the Bybit hack and subsequent buyback has created a bullish environment, supporting price recovery and potential gains.

SOL: +0.7 — Whale accumulation and staking activities indicate strong bullish momentum, making Solana an attractive asset for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite optimistic projections, there is no significant change in market data or sentiment to justify an increased allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With bullish signals across other cryptocurrencies, there is a moderate shift away from stablecoins as risk appetite increases."

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable yet cautious sentiment, with moderate volatility and a relatively strong U.S. dollar. Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing bullish momentum, driven by institutional interest and a recent supply squeeze, respectively. Solana has seen significant whale accumulation, boosting its price and reinforcing positive sentiment. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative optimism, though its fundamentals remain unchanged. Tether remains stable, with its role as a safe haven underscored by its involvement in freezing illicit funds. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward movement in major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional interest and potential for a breakout suggest a positive outlook, despite the lack of a strong technical buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — The supply squeeze and proactive market stabilization efforts by Bybit support a favorable short-term outlook.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking activity indicate strong bullish sentiment, warranting increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.1 — While speculative optimism is high, the lack of substantial technical or fundamental support tempers enthusiasm.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the overall positive sentiment in the crypto market, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-02-22 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Institutional interest in Bitcoin is growing, and a potential breakout is anticipated due to its narrowing trading range. Ethereum's recent price increase is supported by a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit actively stabilizing the market. Solana benefits from substantial whale accumulation, reinforcing its bullish momentum. Dogecoin's sentiment is speculative, driven by optimistic price predictions, while Tether remains stable, demonstrating vigilance in anti-illicit measures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional support and the potential for a breakout suggest a favorable outlook, with strong momentum indicators supporting this view.

ETH: +0.5 — The supply squeeze and proactive market stabilization efforts by Bybit create a positive environment for Ethereum, with technical indicators also showing bullish momentum.

SOL: +0.7 — Whale accumulation and staking activity provide strong bullish momentum, supported by positive technical signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative optimism, there is no substantial data or technical indicators to support a significant change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2025-02-22 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across several major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. Institutional interest and potential breakouts are driving positive sentiment for Bitcoin, while Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze due to the Bybit hack and subsequent buyback efforts. Solana is benefiting from significant whale accumulation and staking, boosting its bullish outlook. Dogecoin, while buoyed by speculative predictions, lacks substantial data-driven support for a major rally. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable and vigilant in its anti-illicit activities, but its role as a safe haven is less appealing in a bullish market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum and potential for a breakout, supported by institutional interest and positive on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's supply squeeze and buyback efforts contribute to a bullish outlook, despite recent price fluctuations.

SOL: +0.7 — Whale accumulation and staking activity reinforce a strong bullish sentiment, making Solana particularly attractive.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish predictions, there is no substantial data-driven support for a significant price movement.

USDT: -0.4 — In a bullish environment, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-02-22 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 18.47. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a bullish sentiment in traditional markets, which may spill over into the crypto market. Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing signs of potential breakouts, supported by institutional interest and recent market events such as the Bybit hack affecting Ethereum's supply. Solana is experiencing bullish momentum due to significant whale activity, while Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative optimism. Tether remains stable with active measures against illicit activities, maintaining its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's potential breakout and institutional support are positive indicators. Despite the lack of a strong trend signal, the bullish momentum and narrowing price range suggest an upward move.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze and positive price action following the Bybit hack, with additional support from Bybit's buyback efforts. This creates a strong bullish case.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's price is supported by significant whale accumulation and staking activity, reinforcing its bullish momentum.

DOGE: +0.2 — While speculative optimism is high, the lack of strong technical signals tempers enthusiasm. However, the recent surge in on-chain activity suggests some positive sentiment.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals across other assets, there's a slight preference to rotate capital out of USDT to capture potential gains in riskier assets."
2025-02-22 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Institutional interest in Bitcoin and a potential breakout from its narrowing price range suggest a positive outlook for BTC. Ethereum has experienced a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit's buyback efforts further supporting its price recovery. Solana's price is buoyed by significant whale accumulation and staking activity, reinforcing its bullish momentum. Dogecoin is seeing speculative optimism, although its potential for substantial gains remains speculative. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its involvement in freezing funds tied to illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a favorable outlook, supported by bullish on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.5 — Recent price recovery due to supply constraints and buyback efforts indicate a positive short-term trajectory.

SOL: +0.4 — Whale accumulation and staking activity provide strong support for continued upward momentum.

DOGE: +0.2 — Speculative optimism and bullish sentiment provide a mildly positive outlook, though risks remain.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several bullish indicators across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong institutional support and is trading within a tightening range, suggesting a potential breakout. Ethereum has seen a price boost due to a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit's efforts to stabilize the market further supporting its price. Solana is benefiting from whale accumulation and staking activities, reinforcing its bullish momentum. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative optimism, though its price predictions remain highly speculative. The macroeconomic environment, with moderate volatility and stable traditional asset prices, supports a balanced risk appetite, though caution remains due to potential market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional support and a narrowing price range suggest a potential breakout. Strong on-chain activity and bullish technical indicators further support a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — The recent supply squeeze and market stabilization efforts by Bybit have created a favorable environment for price appreciation, supported by bullish technical signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking activities indicate strong confidence in Solana, with technical indicators supporting continued bullish momentum.

DOGE: 0.1 — While there is speculative optimism, the lack of substantial on-chain activity and the highly speculative nature of price predictions warrant a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish indicators for other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected as investors seek higher returns."
2025-02-22 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is experiencing a narrowing trading range, suggesting a potential breakout, supported by institutional interest. Ethereum's price has been positively impacted by a supply squeeze following a significant hack, with Bybit's buyback efforts further stabilizing the market. Solana has seen a price lift due to significant whale accumulation and staking, reinforcing bullish momentum. Dogecoin is buoyed by speculative bullish predictions, although these remain highly speculative. Meanwhile, Tether's actions in freezing illicit funds demonstrate ongoing vigilance in maintaining market integrity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin shows strong bullish momentum with institutional support and a potential breakout on the horizon. The narrowing price range suggests a significant move could be imminent, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum benefits from a supply squeeze and market stabilization efforts post-hack, contributing to bullish momentum. The recent price recovery and positive news flow support increased allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's price is positively influenced by whale accumulation and staking, indicating strong market confidence. The consistent bullish momentum suggests a favorable environment for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — While Dogecoin has speculative bullish predictions, the overall market sentiment is positive. However, the speculative nature of the price predictions warrants a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies across major cryptocurrencies, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-02-22 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several assets showing bullish momentum and positive technical indicators. Bitcoin is experiencing a narrowing price range, hinting at a potential breakout, supported by growing institutional interest. Ethereum has seen a price increase due to a supply squeeze following the Bybit hack, with Bybit's efforts to stabilize the market further bolstering confidence. Solana is benefiting from significant whale accumulation and staking activity, reinforcing its bullish outlook. Dogecoin has speculative bullish projections, though these are largely based on optimistic scenarios. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its actions against illicit funds.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest bullish momentum, and the potential for a breakout is supported by institutional interest. This makes it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — The recent supply squeeze and market stabilization efforts post-Bybit hack have created a favorable environment for Ethereum, supporting a positive allocation signal.

SOL: +0.7 — Strong whale accumulation and staking activity indicate robust demand and bullish momentum, making Solana highly attractive for increased capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is speculative optimism around Dogecoin, the lack of substantial data-driven momentum tempers enthusiasm, warranting a modest positive allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish signals across other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2025-02-22 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment for cryptocurrencies appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential breakout, supported by institutional interest and a tightening price range. Ethereum's supply dynamics have been impacted by the Bybit hack, leading to a short-term price increase due to perceived scarcity and buybacks. Solana has seen significant whale accumulation, reinforcing its bullish outlook. Dogecoin has speculative bullish projections, though these are largely based on past trends and remain highly speculative. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but is seeing some scrutiny due to its involvement in freezing funds related to illicit activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.6 — The recent supply squeeze and buybacks post-Bybit hack have created a bullish environment for Ethereum, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking activity provide a bullish signal, though less pronounced than BTC and ETH, supporting moderate allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While there is speculative bullish sentiment, the lack of substantial data-driven momentum tempers enthusiasm, suggesting a cautious increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings aligns with a strategy to capitalize on potential upward movements in the crypto market."
2025-02-22 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Institutional interest in Bitcoin and strategic moves by platforms like Bybit to stabilize Ethereum post-hack are contributing to positive momentum. Solana's price is buoyed by significant whale activity, while speculative optimism surrounds Dogecoin. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but sees some strategic use in market stabilization efforts, such as freezing funds linked to the Bybit hack. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, supports a risk-on environment, though the high gold price suggests some underlying caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and potential breakout signals suggest increasing exposure to Bitcoin is prudent. The technical indicators are consistently bullish, with a narrowing trading range hinting at an imminent upward move.

ETH: +0.6 — The recent supply squeeze due to the Bybit hack and subsequent buyback efforts are driving short-term recovery and bullish momentum. The technical indicators remain positive, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking activity reinforce bullish sentiment, with technical indicators supporting continued upward momentum. This makes Solana an attractive asset for increased allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — While speculative projections are overly optimistic, the positive sentiment and slight price increases justify a cautious increase in exposure, though not as strongly as other assets.

USDT: -0.3 — With a generally bullish market sentiment and increased risk appetite, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly in favor of more volatile assets is advisable, though retaining some USDT for potential market corrections remains prudent."
2025-02-22 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Institutional support and potential breakouts are driving positive sentiment for Bitcoin, while Ethereum is experiencing a supply squeeze due to a recent hack, leading to a short-term price recovery. Solana sees bullish momentum from significant whale accumulation and staking activity. Dogecoin's sentiment is buoyed by speculative bullish projections, although these are highly speculative. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its role as a safe haven highlighted by its involvement in freezing illicit funds tied to recent hacks. The macroeconomic context shows stable conditions with moderate volatility, suggesting a balanced risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional support and potential breakout signals, along with strong technical indicators, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.6 — The supply squeeze and buyback activity post-hack create a positive short-term outlook, supported by bullish technical signals.

SOL: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and staking reinforce bullish momentum, making Solana an attractive asset in the current market.

DOGE: +0.3 — While speculative projections are optimistic, the lack of substantial data-driven momentum tempers the outlook slightly.

USDT: -0.2 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2025-02-22 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 18.72. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong at 106.6, which can exert pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin's recent acquisition by MicroStrategy at a significant scale suggests strong institutional interest and confidence in BTC's long-term value. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, reinforcing positive sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but their technical indicators suggest mixed momentum. USDT shows signs of a potential breakout, indicating increased demand for liquidity or safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The substantial purchase by MicroStrategy and strong on-chain activity signal robust institutional support and bullish sentiment, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and stable price action suggest a favorable outlook, though not as strong as BTC's institutional backing.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and lack of significant news suggest a neutral stance; no compelling reason to adjust current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a slight increase in on-chain activity, the absence of significant news or strong technical signals keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — While USDT shows a potential breakout, the overall bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on risk-on assets."
2025-02-23 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish technical indicators across most major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has seen significant corporate interest, highlighted by MicroStrategy's large purchase, which suggests confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum maintains a strong technical setup, reinforcing its bullish momentum. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but technical indicators suggest a stable environment. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, which supports a balanced approach to risk-taking. Given this backdrop, a slight preference for risk assets over stablecoins is warranted, though caution is advised due to the absence of strong bullish signals across all assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong corporate accumulation and bullish technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, warranting increased exposure.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical setup and recent price stability make Ethereum attractive, though slightly less so than Bitcoin due to the lack of major news catalysts.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite stable technical indicators, the absence of significant news and mixed momentum signals suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining a neutral stance on Dogecoin is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment in risk assets and stable macroeconomic conditions, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in cryptocurrencies."
2025-02-23 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong corporate accumulation as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase, which supports a bullish outlook. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, reinforcing positive sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana shows signs of technical weakness with a possible price breakdown. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could influence risk appetite. In this context, maintaining a balanced approach with a slight tilt towards growth assets seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong corporate accumulation and bullish technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum. The recent large purchase by MicroStrategy reinforces confidence.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish technical setup and positive momentum signals indicate a favorable outlook, though less aggressive than Bitcoin due to slightly lower recent price performance.

SOL: -0.3 — Technical signals indicate potential weakness, with prices below the lower Bollinger Band. Lack of significant news further dampens sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the absence of significant news and the recent slight price decline suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive sentiment in BTC and ETH, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2025-02-23 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish inclination for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price is supported by significant corporate accumulation, as evidenced by MicroStrategy's recent purchase, which reflects confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, reinforcing its upward momentum. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news, with Solana experiencing a bearish technical setup, while Dogecoin maintains bullish momentum despite a lack of news. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a relatively stable risk environment, potentially favoring risk-on assets over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy and consistent bullish technical signals suggest a favorable outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.5 — Bullish technical setup and maintaining key support levels indicate a positive momentum, though not as strong as Bitcoin.

SOL: -0.2 — Lack of bullish signals and a bearish technical setup suggest caution, though no significant news impacts the sentiment.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite no major news, the bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity support a modest positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to allocate capital towards riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable yet cautious sentiment, with the S&P 500 maintaining high levels and a moderate volatility index. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could exert pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant corporate purchase by MicroStrategy, indicating strong institutional interest and potential upward momentum. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, although recent price movements have been relatively stable. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but their technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook. Tether remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, but its role as a safe haven might diminish if risk appetite increases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — The large acquisition by MicroStrategy highlights strong institutional demand, coupled with bullish technical indicators, suggesting a favorable outlook for Bitcoin.

**ETH: +0.5** — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and stable price action support a positive allocation, although the lack of significant news tempers enthusiasm slightly.

**SOL: 0.0** — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana doesn't present a compelling case for increased allocation at this time.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Despite some on-chain activity, the absence of significant news or strong technical signals suggests maintaining current exposure.

**USDT: -0.5** — With increased interest in risk assets like BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential upward movements in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-02-23 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility (VIX at 18.72) and a strong U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 106.6), which could exert some pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin has seen significant accumulation by MicroStrategy, indicating strong institutional interest, which may support its price. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, suggesting potential for upward movement. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news catalysts, and their technical indicators are mixed, with Solana showing potential weakness. Tether remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strong institutional buying by MicroStrategy and the bullish momentum signals suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite mixed momentum signals, Ethereum's bullish technical setup and price stability above key moving averages provide a positive outlook.

SOL: -0.2 — With no significant news and technical indicators showing potential weakness, Solana appears less attractive for capital allocation at this time.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance for Dogecoin, with no strong impetus for allocation changes.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish signals for BTC and ETH, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2025-02-23 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of strong institutional interest as evidenced by MicroStrategy's significant purchase. This could bolster confidence in BTC's long-term potential. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, suggesting continued upward momentum. However, Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news catalysts, and their technical indicators do not show strong buy signals. The macroeconomic environment, with relatively stable oil prices and a moderate VIX, suggests a neutral to slightly positive risk sentiment, which could support risk-on assets like BTC and ETH. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional accumulation and bullish technical indicators suggest a favorable outlook. The recent purchase by MicroStrategy is a significant vote of confidence.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical setup and price momentum are supportive. The asset maintains a positive trend above key moving averages.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest no strong directional bias. Maintain current exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a slight increase in price, there is no significant news or technical momentum to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive sentiment in BTC and ETH, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into these risk assets."
2025-02-23 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed picture for risk assets, with relatively high interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar index, which could exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. However, the S&P 500 remains robust, and volatility is moderate, suggesting some resilience in broader markets. Bitcoin has seen significant corporate accumulation, which could provide a bullish underpinning despite its current technical signals being mixed. Ethereum is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, supported by technical indicators and recent price action. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news catalysts, and their technical indicators are not strongly bullish. Tether remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, but its bullish technical indicators suggest some demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite mixed technical signals, the significant purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, which could support prices in the near term.

**ETH: +0.8** — Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum with a breakout above key technical levels, supported by positive news, making it an attractive allocation.

**SOL: 0.0** — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana does not present a clear opportunity for capital allocation at this time.

**DOGE: -0.1** — While Dogecoin has shown some price increase, the lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation.

**USDT: -0.3** — Given the bullish signals in other assets, particularly ETH, there is a slight preference to rotate some capital out of stablecoins to capture potential upside in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 18.72. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong at 106.6, which could exert some pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent activity is highlighted by MicroStrategy's significant purchase, indicating strong institutional interest, although technical indicators suggest a lack of immediate bullish momentum. Ethereum shows a bullish technical setup, supported by both trend and momentum indicators. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, with their technical indicators showing mixed signals. USDT remains stable with bullish momentum, suggesting continued demand for liquidity.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the substantial purchase by MicroStrategy underscores strong institutional confidence, which could support future price increases.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup, along with positive momentum indicators, suggests a strong case for increased allocation, especially given its recent price breakout.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, Solana remains neutral. Its price and volume movements do not currently justify a change in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin shows no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral stance in the absence of clear directional signals.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to take advantage of potential gains in more volatile assets."
2025-02-23 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed backdrop for cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which typically pressures crypto assets, but the relatively stable S&P 500 and moderate volatility index suggest a neutral risk environment. Bitcoin's recent acquisition by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, potentially supporting its price. Ethereum shows consistent bullish technical signals, reinforcing its upward momentum. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, but Solana's technical indicators are neutral, while Dogecoin shows some bullish momentum. Tether remains stable, as expected for a stablecoin, but with no significant news to influence its demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional buying by MicroStrategy and strong on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook, despite mixed technical signals.

ETH: +0.8 — Consistent bullish technical indicators and positive news reinforce Ethereum's strong momentum, making it attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana remains a hold as it lacks a clear directional signal.

DOGE: +0.2 — While lacking significant news, Dogecoin's bullish momentum indicators suggest a slight positive bias, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-02-23 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility (VIX at 18.72) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a risk-on sentiment. The U.S. Dollar Index is high, which could put pressure on non-USD assets, but the overall crypto market appears to be showing mixed signals. Bitcoin has seen significant corporate accumulation with MicroStrategy's large purchase, potentially providing a bullish underpinning. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, reinforcing its positive momentum. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, while Tether remains stable as expected. The market data reflects a mixed sentiment with some assets showing bullish momentum and others lacking clear direction.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The significant purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, and despite mixed technical signals, this news could drive further bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's consistent bullish technical setup and momentum suggest a favorable outlook, supported by its resilience above key moving averages.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, Solana lacks a clear directional bias, warranting a hold position.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest maintaining the current position without changes.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the overall risk-on sentiment and positive signals in BTC and ETH, reducing stablecoin holdings to allocate more capital towards these assets seems prudent."
2025-02-23 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with a moderate 10-Year Treasury Yield and a low VIX indicating a calm market. However, the high U.S. Dollar Index suggests a strong dollar, which might pressure risk assets. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing some bearish technical signals, but the significant purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, potentially providing a floor for prices. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by positive news, while Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, showing mixed technical signals. USDT remains stable, with no major shifts in market sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite bearish technicals, the large purchase by MicroStrategy suggests strong institutional support, which could stabilize prices.

ETH: +0.6 — Bullish technical indicators and positive news reinforce Ethereum's upward momentum, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance, with no clear direction for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Low on-chain activity and absence of significant news result in a neutral position, with no compelling reason to adjust holdings.

USDT: -0.2 — With some bullish signals in ETH and BTC, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings may be warranted to capitalize on potential upward movements in risk assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong, which can exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies, but the S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment. Bitcoin is experiencing a price decline, possibly due to technical breakdown signals, despite MicroStrategy's significant purchase, which could provide long-term support. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by positive momentum indicators. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news impact, but both have mixed technical signals, with Solana showing potential breakdown signs. Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite MicroStrategy's large purchase, BTC is showing technical weakness with a breakdown below the Bollinger Bands and negative momentum indicators. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.8 — Ethereum shows strong bullish momentum and technical indicators, reinforced by news of maintaining a bullish setup. It is attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's technical indicators suggest a potential breakdown, with no significant news to counteract this. Maintain current holdings without increasing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's technical indicators are mixed, with no significant news to drive a change in sentiment. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the technical weakness in BTC and SOL, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-23 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakdown, trading below its lower Bollinger Band, despite significant accumulation by MicroStrategy, which suggests institutional confidence. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by positive momentum indicators. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news-driven catalysts, with Solana experiencing a potential breakdown and Dogecoin lacking strong momentum. The macroeconomic context is stable, with moderate volatility and no drastic changes in key indicators, suggesting a balanced risk environment. USDT remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven amidst fluctuating market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the potential breakdown, the significant purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional support, which could stabilize or boost prices in the short term.

ETH: +0.6 — Consistent bullish momentum and positive technical indicators suggest Ethereum is well-positioned for further gains, making it relatively attractive.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance is appropriate, with no clear direction for capital allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Absence of significant news and low on-chain activity provide no strong justification for changing the current allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the cautious optimism in the market and the potential for upward movement in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on riskier assets."
2025-02-23 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the potential breakdown in price regime, the significant acquisition by MicroStrategy suggests underlying demand, providing a modest positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Strong bullish technical setup and momentum indicators support a positive allocation, reinforced by news of maintaining key levels.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, with no clear signals to increase or decrease exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Absence of significant news and mixed technical indicators result in a neutral position, with no compelling reason to adjust holdings.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the mixed signals across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings may be warranted to capitalize on potential opportunities in BTC and ETH."
2025-02-23 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight downturn with technical indicators suggesting a potential breakdown, despite MicroStrategy's significant purchase, which indicates strong institutional interest. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by positive price action and on-chain activity. Solana and Dogecoin are both experiencing price declines, with Solana showing signs of a potential breakdown. The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with some assets showing resilience while others face downward pressure. Given the macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and stable gold prices, there is a moderate risk-off sentiment, which could favor holding stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the technical breakdown signals, MicroStrategy's large acquisition suggests strong institutional support, which could provide a floor for prices.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and positive on-chain activity indicate a favorable environment for potential gains, making it an attractive asset in the current market.

SOL: -0.1 — With no significant news and technical indicators suggesting a possible breakdown, a cautious approach is warranted, though existing holdings should not be aggressively reduced.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, with no strong reason to adjust current holdings.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets like ETH, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to take advantage of potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of slight price increases and decreases across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent acquisition by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, though its technical indicators suggest a lack of immediate bullish momentum. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by positive price action and news, despite some mixed signals in momentum. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news or strong technical signals, indicating a neutral stance. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively stable S&P 500 and moderate volatility, suggests a balanced risk appetite, but the high U.S. dollar index may exert pressure on crypto assets. In this context, maintaining a balanced portfolio with some allocation to stablecoins like USDT is prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the significant purchase by MicroStrategy suggests strong institutional support, warranting a moderately positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and positive news support a favorable allocation, although some caution is advised due to mixed momentum signals.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical indicators, Solana remains neutral, reflecting a wait-and-see approach.

DOGE: -0.2 — Low on-chain activity and lack of significant news suggest a slight reduction in exposure, given the current market conditions.

USDT: +0.1 — While maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent in a mixed market environment, the overall sentiment leans slightly towards risk assets, justifying a minimal positive score."
2025-02-23 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by the technical indicators and recent price movements. Bitcoin is experiencing a potential breakdown as it trades below its Bollinger Bands, despite MicroStrategy's significant purchase, which could provide some long-term support. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup with its short-term moving average above the long-term, although its momentum signal remains bearish. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news or bullish signals, with both assets experiencing price declines and trading below their Bollinger Bands at times. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, suggests a risk-off environment, potentially favoring stablecoin holdings like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the bearish technical indicators, MicroStrategy's large purchase suggests potential long-term support. However, caution is warranted due to the current breakdown signals.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and recent price stability make it relatively attractive, especially with its short MA above the long MA, indicating potential upward momentum.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical signals suggest a hold position. The asset is trading within its Bollinger Bands, indicating no clear direction.

DOGE: -0.2 — With no significant news and bearish technical indicators, reducing exposure slightly may be prudent, given the current market sentiment and lack of upward momentum.

USDT: +0.5 — In a cautious market environment, maintaining or increasing stablecoin holdings provides a safe haven, especially given the lack of strong bullish signals across other assets."
2025-02-23 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin experiencing significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy, which could provide a bullish underpinning despite its technical indicators suggesting a potential breakdown. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by its price holding above key moving averages, although its momentum indicators are not yet signaling a strong buy. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news or strong technical signals, with both experiencing slight price fluctuations. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, suggests a cautious approach, potentially favoring stablecoins like USDT in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The significant purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, which could support prices despite current technical weakness.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and sustained price above key moving averages suggest moderate potential for upward movement.

SOL: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed technical signals result in a neutral stance, with no clear direction.

DOGE: 0.0 — Absence of significant news and technical signals keeps Dogecoin in a holding pattern.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market signals and potential for volatility, maintaining a stablecoin position provides a buffer against downside risks."

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed picture, with relatively stable interest rates and a moderate level of market volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could exert downward pressure on crypto prices, while the S&P 500's high level suggests a risk-on sentiment in traditional markets. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin has seen significant corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy, which may provide a bullish undertone despite a lack of immediate technical buy signals. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by strong on-chain activity, which reinforces its attractiveness. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news and show no strong technical signals, while USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals, the significant purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, which could support future price appreciation.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and strong on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, Solana remains neutral in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin lacks significant news or technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance in the absence of clear market drivers.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the relatively bullish sentiment for BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to increase exposure to these more promising assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing significant institutional accumulation as evidenced by MicroStrategy's recent purchase. This signals confidence in Bitcoin's long-term value, despite the lack of immediate bullish technical indicators. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, supported by its price holding above key moving averages, although momentum indicators remain neutral. Solana and Dogecoin show no significant news or technical signals to suggest a strong directional move. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively high U.S. dollar index, suggests a cautious approach, with volatility remaining moderate. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT may serve as a safe haven, but the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets exists if bullish signals strengthen.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The significant purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, which could support price stability and potential upside despite neutral technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — While Ethereum's technical indicators are mixed, the maintenance of a bullish setup above key moving averages suggests a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, Solana remains neutral, warranting a hold position.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest no immediate action is necessary for Dogecoin.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets due to positive developments in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-02-23 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a stable yet cautious sentiment, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 18.72. The S&P 500 is at a high level, suggesting a generally positive risk sentiment in traditional markets. However, the U.S. Dollar Index is strong, which can exert downward pressure on cryptocurrencies. In the crypto market, Bitcoin sees significant corporate accumulation with MicroStrategy's large purchase, which could bolster confidence in BTC. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, reinforcing its appeal. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, while Tether remains stable, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The substantial purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional confidence, and the surge in on-chain activity supports a bullish outlook despite the lack of immediate technical buy signals.

ETH: +0.5 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and consistent price performance make it attractive, although the lack of momentum signals suggests a more cautious approach compared to BTC.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana remains a hold. Its lack of momentum or trend signals does not justify increased allocation at this time.

DOGE: -0.2 — Low on-chain activity and the absence of positive news suggest a slight reduction in exposure, especially given the current holdings.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally positive sentiment in risk assets and strong indicators for BTC and ETH, capital rotation out of stablecoins is warranted to take advantage of potential gains in other assets."
2025-02-23 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable corporate accumulation by MicroStrategy, which could signal confidence in BTC's long-term value. Ethereum maintains a bullish technical setup, suggesting potential upward momentum, although recent price changes have been minimal. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, and their technical indicators do not suggest strong trends. The macroeconomic environment shows stable interest rates and a relatively low volatility index, which could support risk-on sentiment, but the high U.S. dollar index might temper enthusiasm for non-USD assets. 

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — The significant purchase by MicroStrategy indicates strong institutional interest, coupled with recent bullish momentum signals, making BTC an attractive allocation.

**ETH: +0.5** — Despite the lack of strong momentum signals, the bullish technical setup and stability above key moving averages support a moderately positive outlook.

**SOL: 0.0** — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, there is no compelling reason to adjust the current allocation.

**DOGE: -0.2** — Low on-chain activity and lack of news suggest a slight reduction in exposure, especially given the absence of bullish signals.

**USDT: -0.5** — Given the positive sentiment in BTC and ETH, there is a rationale to reduce USDT holdings to allocate more capital towards these assets, reflecting a moderate risk-on approach."

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows mixed signals with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin has seen a significant corporate purchase by MicroStrategy, indicating strong institutional interest, although its technical indicators remain neutral. Ethereum is maintaining a bullish technical setup, supported by its price holding above key moving averages. Solana and Dogecoin lack significant news, and their technical indicators do not suggest strong momentum in either direction. The macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable indices, suggests a cautious but slightly risk-on sentiment, which could favor cryptocurrencies over stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The substantial purchase by MicroStrategy is a strong bullish signal, suggesting institutional confidence. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderate positive score.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's bullish technical setup and price stability above key moving averages support a positive outlook, making it attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, Solana does not present a compelling case for increased allocation at this time.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and low on-chain activity suggest a neutral stance, with no strong signals to adjust current holdings.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the slight risk-on sentiment and potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets, a modest reduction in USDT exposure is warranted."
2025-02-24 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience with signs of accumulation despite a recent dip, while Ethereum has been hit hard by a significant hack, leading to a sharp decline. Solana is experiencing a downturn, reaching its lowest price of the year, exacerbated by the broader crypto sell-off. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with speculative bullish sentiment from analysts, though this is not reflected in current market data. Tether remains stable with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent dips, accumulation signals and resilience compared to altcoins suggest a moderate buy opportunity, especially with institutional interest.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the ByBit hack and broader altcoin sell-off create a bearish outlook, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Continued price weakness and reaching a yearly low suggest reducing exposure, though not aggressively due to potential recovery in the broader market.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative bullish sentiment is not supported by current technicals or volume, so maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the bearish market conditions, maintaining some capital in stablecoins is advisable to manage risk and provide liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-24 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by broader macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience, with signs of accumulation despite a price dip below $94K. Ethereum has been hit hard by a significant hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price, exacerbated by a general altcoin sell-off. Solana has also been affected by the same hack, reaching its lowest price of the year. Dogecoin, despite the negative market sentiment, has some speculative bullish projections. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, accumulation by institutions suggests potential for recovery. However, macro pressures warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the hack and ongoing bearish sentiment in altcoins suggest further downside risk, justifying a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and technical breakdown indicate a need to reduce holdings, especially given the broader market weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there are speculative bullish projections, the overall market environment and lack of immediate catalysts suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and volatility, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."
2025-02-24 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown resilience, maintaining a relatively stable position despite broader market weakness and a recent hack. Ethereum has been significantly impacted by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in price and negative sentiment. Solana has also experienced a substantial drop, reaching a yearly low due to the same incident. Dogecoin, despite the bearish environment, has some speculative bullish sentiment from analysts predicting a potential surge. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in volatile conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the bearish macro environment, Bitcoin's resilience and institutional accumulation suggest a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.4 — Recent hack and market-wide sell-off have severely impacted Ethereum, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drop and bearish sentiment following the hack indicate a need to reduce exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative bullish predictions exist, the lack of concrete positive data or sentiment keeps the signal neutral.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent for risk management."

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies, largely influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience, with institutional accumulation signs despite a price dip under $94K. Ethereum has been hit hard by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price. Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced significant price drops, with Solana reaching a yearly low. The market-wide downturn has increased volatility and uncertainty, prompting a cautious approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, Bitcoin shows signs of institutional accumulation, suggesting potential resilience and a relative safe haven compared to altcoins.

ETH: -0.5 — The impact of the ByBit hack and broader altcoin sell-off pressures suggest further downside risk, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's significant price drop to a yearly low and lack of bullish signals indicate continued vulnerability in the current market environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a bullish prediction from an analyst, the current market conditions and lack of immediate catalysts suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for flexibility in future repositioning."

- **Plunges below $150 to yearly low** – SOL tumbled past $150, marking its weakest price of the year amid a broader crypto sell-off.
- **Slides under $160 after weekend hack fallout** – Solana dropped below $160, losing over 7% intraday following the blanket impact of the ByBit incident.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has experienced a decline, though it shows signs of institutional accumulation, suggesting some underlying confidence. Ethereum has been hit hard by a significant hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price and contributing to a broader altcoin sell-off. Solana has also seen a substantial drop, reaching its lowest price of the year, exacerbated by the same security breach. Dogecoin, despite the negative market environment, has some speculative optimism due to bullish projections from analysts. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, signs of institutional accumulation suggest potential for recovery. However, macro pressures warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: -0.4 — The recent hack and subsequent price drop create a challenging environment for Ethereum, with bearish sentiment prevailing.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's significant price decline and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure in the face of continued downward pressure.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative bullish sentiment, the overall market conditions do not support a strong directional move for Dogecoin.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-24 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent negative events, such as the ByBit hack, which have led to significant declines in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Bitcoin has shown some resilience with signs of institutional accumulation, but it remains under pressure from broader market weakness. Ethereum and Solana have been particularly affected by the hack, experiencing sharp declines. Despite the downturn, Dogecoin has seen some speculative interest due to bullish predictions from market analysts. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the price dip, institutional accumulation suggests a potential for recovery. However, macro pressures warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: -0.3 — The recent hack and subsequent sell-off have significantly impacted Ethereum, and bearish sentiment continues to dominate.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana has hit a yearly low, and the lack of positive momentum or recovery signals suggests further caution is needed.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative interest is present, there is no substantial data or momentum to support a strong allocation change.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven against volatility."
2025-02-24 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has experienced a dip below $94K, influenced by broader market weakness, although there are signs of institutional accumulation. Ethereum has been significantly impacted by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price. Solana has also been affected by the hack, reaching its lowest price of the year. Despite these challenges, Dogecoin has seen some positive sentiment from a prominent analyst's bullish prediction. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable with no significant news affecting its price.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, institutional accumulation signals a potential for recovery. However, macro pressures still weigh heavily.

ETH: -0.4 — The recent hack has severely impacted sentiment and price, suggesting a cautious approach until stability returns.

SOL: -0.3 — The asset is at a yearly low following the hack, indicating a need to reduce exposure until clearer recovery signs emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a bullish prediction but no immediate data support for a price surge, suggesting a hold position.

USDT: +0.4 — In the current bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."
2025-02-24 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience despite a dip below $94K, with institutional accumulation potentially providing support. Ethereum has been hit hard by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline, while Solana has reached a yearly low, exacerbated by the same incident. Dogecoin remains buoyed by speculative projections of a massive price surge, though these are not supported by current technical indicators. Tether, as a stablecoin, remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional interest and accumulation signals suggest potential support and resilience, making it relatively attractive in a bearish environment.

ETH: -0.5 — The impact of the ByBit hack and continued bearish sentiment in altcoins suggest reducing exposure to mitigate further downside risk.

SOL: -0.4 — Recent price weakness and the broader sell-off in altcoins, compounded by the hack, suggest caution and a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative projections are optimistic, there is no substantial data or sentiment shift to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."

### 3. News Summaries

- **Altcoin sell-off drags ETH lower** – In a market-wide downturn, poor sentiment hit altcoins hard, pushing Ether down by over 8% on continuing bearish macro cues.

**Solana (SOL)**

- **Plunges below $150 to yearly low** – SOL tumbled past $150, marking its weakest price of the year amid a broader crypto sell-off.
- **Slides under $160 after weekend hack fallout** – Solana dropped below $160, losing over 7% intraday following the blanket impact of the ByBit incident.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience, with institutional interest potentially providing a floor, despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum has been hit hard by a significant hack, exacerbating its decline amid a broader altcoin sell-off. Solana has also suffered from the fallout of the hack, reaching its lowest price of the year. Dogecoin, despite a bearish market, has speculative bullish predictions, though these are not yet reflected in the current price action. USDT remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status as a safe haven in the current environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, institutional accumulation signals a potential floor, making BTC relatively more attractive in a bearish market.

ETH: -0.5 — The recent hack and subsequent price drop have created significant negative sentiment, suggesting a need to reduce exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Continued price weakness and negative news flow indicate a cautious approach, though not as severe as ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative predictions exist, current data does not support a strong directional move, warranting a hold position.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining or increasing stablecoin exposure is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-02-24 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin, despite some institutional accumulation, has been affected by broader market weakness and a recent hack, leading to a dip below $94K. Ethereum has been significantly impacted by a major hack, causing a sharp decline in its price. Solana has also faced substantial losses, reaching a yearly low due to the same hack fallout. Dogecoin, however, has a speculative bullish outlook due to predictions of a massive price surge. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option, showing bullish momentum as investors seek safety amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals potential for recovery. However, macro pressures suggest cautious optimism.

ETH: -0.5 — The significant impact of the hack and ongoing bearish sentiment warrant a reduction in exposure, as further declines are possible.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent price weakness and negative sentiment from the hack suggest reducing exposure, though the long-term potential remains.

DOGE: +0.1 — Speculative bullish sentiment from analyst predictions provides a slight positive outlook, but overall market conditions remain cautious.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current bearish market sentiment and volatility, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2025-02-24 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin, despite showing signs of institutional accumulation, has been affected by broader market weakness and a recent hack, causing its price to dip below $94K. Ethereum has been hit hard by a significant hack involving ByBit, leading to a sharp decline in its price and dragging down the altcoin market. Solana has also experienced a substantial drop, reaching its lowest price of the year, exacerbated by the same hack. Dogecoin, on the other hand, has a bullish outlook from some analysts predicting a significant price surge, although this is speculative. Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven in the current market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, institutional accumulation signals a potential for recovery. However, macroeconomic pressures warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: -0.4 — The recent hack and subsequent price decline create a bearish outlook, with continued negative sentiment in the altcoin space.

SOL: -0.3 — The significant price drop to a yearly low and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure, despite normal on-chain activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — Speculative bullish predictions are not supported by current market data, leading to a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-02-24 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment remains cautious with a bearish tilt, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin, despite a price dip below $94K, shows signs of institutional accumulation, suggesting some underlying confidence. Ethereum has been hit hard by a significant hack, resulting in a sharp decline, exacerbated by a broader altcoin sell-off. Solana is also under pressure, reaching yearly lows due to the same incident. Dogecoin, however, has a speculative bullish outlook based on analyst predictions, although this is not reflected in current market data. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price dips, institutional accumulation signals potential for recovery. The macro environment remains challenging, but BTC's resilience compared to altcoins is notable.

ETH: -0.5 — Recent hack and subsequent sell-off have significantly impacted ETH, with bearish sentiment prevailing. Technical indicators do not yet show signs of recovery.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's price has reached yearly lows, and the lack of positive momentum suggests continued caution. The broader market downturn and recent hack impact weigh heavily.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish predictions, current market data does not support a strong directional move. Neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: +0.5 — In a volatile environment, USDT's stability is attractive for capital preservation. Increased allocation as a defensive measure amidst broader market uncertainty."

- **Altcoin sell-off drags ETH lower** – In a market-wide downturn, poor sentiment hit altcoins hard, pushing Ether down by over 8% on continuing bearish macro cues.

**Solana (SOL)**

- **Plunges below $150 to yearly low** – SOL tumbled past $150, marking its weakest price of the year amid a broader crypto sell-off.
- **Slides under $160 after weekend hack fallout** – Solana dropped below $160, losing over 7% intraday following the blanket impact of the ByBit incident.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent negative events, such as the ByBit hack. Bitcoin has shown some resilience with signs of institutional accumulation despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum has been hit hard by the hack, leading to a sharp decline, while Solana has also suffered significant losses, marking a yearly low. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with speculative bullish predictions, but lacks substantial data support. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amidst the market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent dips, institutional accumulation and bullish momentum signals suggest potential for recovery. Relative strength compared to other assets supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the ByBit hack and bearish sentiment across altcoins weigh heavily on Ethereum, suggesting a cautious approach and potential reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Continued downward pressure and recent price lows indicate a need to reduce exposure, especially given the lack of bullish technical signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative predictions are bullish, there is no substantial data or technical support to justify a change in allocation at this time.

USDT: +0.2 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a buffer against volatility, supporting a slight increase in exposure."
2025-02-24 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience compared to altcoins, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum has been significantly impacted by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price. Solana also experienced a substantial drop, reaching a yearly low, as the broader market sell-off continues. Dogecoin, while not directly affected by negative news, remains stable with speculative bullish predictions. USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation and resilience compared to altcoins suggest potential for recovery.

ETH: -0.3 — The recent hack and subsequent price decline create uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.4 — Continued downward pressure and reaching a yearly low indicate a need to reduce exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative bullish sentiment, the lack of substantial data or news keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.2 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins provides a buffer against volatility."
2025-02-24 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown resilience, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a dip below $94K. Ethereum has been significantly impacted by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price. Solana and other altcoins have also suffered from the broader market downturn, with Solana hitting a yearly low. Dogecoin's outlook is mixed, with speculative bullish predictions contrasting with the current market conditions. In this environment, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation suggests potential for recovery. However, macro pressures warrant caution.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the ByBit hack and bearish sentiment weigh heavily on ETH, making it less attractive in the short term.

SOL: -0.2 — With Solana hitting a yearly low and lacking positive momentum signals, reducing exposure is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed signals with speculative bullish predictions but no immediate data support. Hold current position.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2025-02-24 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and a significant hack affecting the crypto space. Bitcoin has dipped below $94K, yet shows signs of institutional accumulation, suggesting some underlying support. Ethereum has been hit hard by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline, while Solana has reached a yearly low amid the broader market sell-off. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with speculative bullish predictions, but lacks immediate catalysts. In this environment, stablecoins like USDT remain a safe haven, reflecting cautious investor sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals potential support, making BTC relatively attractive in a bearish market.

ETH: -0.4 — The recent hack and subsequent price drop have weakened ETH's position, suggesting a reduction in exposure until stability returns.

SOL: -0.5 — With SOL hitting a yearly low and lacking bullish signals, it's prudent to reduce exposure given the current market weakness.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative predictions exist, there are no strong data-driven catalysts to justify a change in allocation at this time.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity, aligning with cautious investor sentiment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and a recent major hack affecting Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin has dipped below $94K, influenced by broader market weakness, though there are signs of institutional accumulation. Ethereum has been hit hard by the ByBit hack, causing a sharp decline and dragging altcoins lower. Solana has also reached a yearly low, exacerbated by the hack's fallout. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with speculative bullish sentiment despite the broader downturn. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option amid increased volatility and uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the price dip, institutional accumulation suggests potential support. However, macro pressures keep the outlook cautious.

ETH: -0.4 — The recent hack has severely impacted sentiment and price, with no immediate recovery signals. Reducing exposure is prudent.

SOL: -0.3 — The yearly low and hack-related sell-off indicate continued weakness. A cautious approach is recommended.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative sentiment is positive, the lack of substantial data or news changes suggests a hold position.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current bearish market conditions, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins is advisable to manage risk."
2025-02-24 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries

- **Altcoin sell-off drags ETH lower** – In a market-wide downturn, poor sentiment hit altcoins hard, pushing Ether down by over 8% on continuing bearish macro cues.

**Solana (SOL)**

- **Plunges below $150 to yearly low** – SOL tumbled past $150, marking its weakest price of the year amid a broader crypto sell-off.
- **Slides under $160 after weekend hack fallout** – Solana dropped below $160, losing over 7% intraday following the blanket impact of the ByBit incident.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience compared to other altcoins, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a price dip below $94K. Ethereum has been significantly affected by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price. Solana has also experienced a substantial drop, reaching its lowest price of the year. Dogecoin, despite the bearish market, has some speculative bullish sentiment due to predictions of a massive price surge. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation suggests potential for recovery. Bitcoin's relative strength compared to altcoins supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the ByBit hack and broader altcoin sell-off creates a negative outlook. Current holdings should be reduced slightly until sentiment improves.

SOL: -0.4 — With Solana reaching a yearly low and affected by the market-wide downturn, it's prudent to reduce exposure given the lack of positive catalysts.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative predictions exist, there is no substantial data or sentiment shift to justify a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.4 — In a bearish environment, maintaining liquidity and stability through USDT is advisable, providing a buffer against further market declines."
2025-02-24 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has experienced a decline below $94K, although there are signs of institutional accumulation, suggesting some underlying support. Ethereum has been significantly impacted by a major hack, leading to a sharp price drop and contributing to a broader altcoin sell-off. Solana has also reached a yearly low, exacerbated by the same security incident. Despite these negative trends, Dogecoin has seen speculative interest with predictions of a potential massive price surge. In this uncertain environment, Tether remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals potential support, making BTC relatively more attractive in a bearish market.

ETH: -0.5 — The recent hack has severely impacted ETH, and with ongoing bearish sentiment, it is prudent to reduce exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's yearly low and vulnerability to broader market sell-offs suggest reducing exposure until stability is observed.

DOGE: 0.0 — While speculative interest exists, there is no substantial data or sentiment shift to warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for flexibility in future allocations."
2025-02-24 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is broadly bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown resilience compared to altcoins, with signs of institutional accumulation despite a price dip below $94K. Ethereum has been significantly impacted by a major hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price, exacerbated by a general altcoin sell-off. Solana has reached a yearly low, similarly affected by the broader market downturn and the hack fallout. Dogecoin, despite a significant price decrease, has some speculative bullish sentiment due to an analyst's prediction of a potential massive surge. Tether remains stable, with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in this volatile environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals potential for recovery. BTC's relative strength compared to altcoins makes it a modest buy.

ETH: -0.5 — The recent hack and subsequent sell-off have severely impacted ETH's price, making it less attractive in the short term.

SOL: -0.4 — With SOL hitting a yearly low and no immediate recovery signals, reducing exposure is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite speculative bullish sentiment, the recent price drop and lack of strong supporting data suggest a hold position.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the current bearish market conditions, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure is advisable to mitigate risk."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries

- **Steady accumulation signs despite recent dip** – After a weekend hack triggered a price drop near $95K, institutions—including MicroStrategy hinted by Michael Saylor—are likely taking the opportunity to accumulate.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **Sharp decline following major hack** – Ethereum fell from $2.84K to $2.62K as stolen funds from a $1.5B ByBit hack, entirely in ETH, shook the market.
- **Altcoin sell-off drags ETH lower** – In a market-wide downturn, poor sentiment hit altcoins hard, pushing Ether down by over 8% on continuing bearish macro cues.

**Solana (SOL)**

- **Plunges below $150 to yearly low** – SOL tumbled past $150, marking its weakest price of the year amid a broader crypto sell-off.
- **Slides under $160 after weekend hack fallout** – Solana dropped below $160, losing over 7% intraday following the blanket impact of the ByBit incident.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Prominent analyst projects massive price surge** – A market expert predicted Dogecoin could surge as much as 19,533% to reach $45 during the current bull cycle.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has shown some resilience despite a dip below $94K, with signs of institutional accumulation. Ethereum has been hit hard by a significant hack, leading to a sharp decline in its price, compounded by broader altcoin sell-offs. Solana has reached a yearly low, reflecting the broader crypto market downturn. Meanwhile, Dogecoin remains relatively stable, with speculative optimism from analysts, though without immediate catalysts. Tether remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals potential support, making BTC relatively attractive in a bearish market.

ETH: -0.5 — The recent hack and subsequent price drop, coupled with broader altcoin weakness, suggest reducing exposure to ETH.

SOL: -0.3 — With SOL hitting a yearly low and no immediate recovery signals, it is prudent to reduce exposure slightly.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative optimism, no substantial data supports an immediate change in allocation.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."
2025-02-24 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- **Altcoin sell-off drags ETH lower** – In a market-wide downturn, poor sentiment hit altcoins hard, pushing Ether down by over 8% on continuing bearish macro cues.

**Solana (SOL)**

- **Plunges below $150 to yearly low** – SOL tumbled past $150, marking its weakest price of the year amid a broader crypto sell-off.
- **Slides under $160 after weekend hack fallout** – Solana dropped below $160, losing over 7% intraday following the blanket impact of the ByBit incident.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has dipped below $94K, affected by broader market weakness, though there are signs of institutional accumulation. Ethereum has experienced a sharp decline due to a significant hack, exacerbating an already negative sentiment in the altcoin market. Solana has hit a yearly low, further impacted by the same hack. Dogecoin, despite a bearish market, has speculative optimism from analysts predicting a massive price surge. USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the price dip, institutional accumulation signals potential support, making BTC relatively attractive in a bearish market.

ETH: -0.5 — The recent hack and subsequent sell-off have severely impacted ETH, and with minimal holdings, reducing exposure is prudent.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's yearly low and negative sentiment from the hack suggest reducing exposure, especially given its current weak technicals.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is speculative bullish sentiment, the overall market conditions and technicals do not support a strong directional move.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure is advisable to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-24 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic pressures and recent security incidents. Bitcoin has seen a decline below $94K, influenced by broader market weakness, although there are signs of institutional accumulation. Ethereum has suffered a sharp decline due to a significant hack, which has shaken investor confidence and contributed to a broader altcoin sell-off. Solana has reached a yearly low, exacerbated by the fallout from the ByBit hack. Dogecoin, despite a bearish environment, has a speculative bullish outlook from analysts. Tether remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, institutional accumulation signals potential support, making it relatively attractive in a bearish market.

ETH: -0.5 — The recent hack has severely impacted sentiment and price, suggesting a cautious approach until stability returns.

SOL: -0.4 — With prices hitting a yearly low and no immediate recovery signals, reducing exposure is prudent given the current market conditions.

DOGE: 0.0 — While a speculative bullish outlook exists, the current market environment does not support aggressive positioning.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is advisable to preserve capital and wait for clearer signals."
2025-02-24 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: -0.3 — With Solana hitting a yearly low and experiencing significant sell pressure, reducing exposure is prudent in the current environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase and speculative bullish predictions, the overall market conditions and recent volatility suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market with high volatility, maintaining or increasing exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for opportunistic reallocation when conditions improve."
2025-02-25 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a substantial sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin registering its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum being heavily impacted by the Bybit hack. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen significant price drops, although there is some speculative potential for a rebound in Dogecoin. Tether remains stable, with its CEO emphasizing its global importance despite facing regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is under significant bearish pressure due to macroeconomic jitters and the Bybit hack. The lack of positive technical signals suggests a cautious approach, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is similarly affected by the Bybit incident, with weak technicals and sentiment. The OTC purchase by Bybit provides some support, but not enough to warrant increased exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of bullish signals suggest maintaining a reduced position. The broader market sell-off impacts its short-term outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a significant drop, there is potential for a rebound as suggested by technical analysis. However, the current market conditions warrant a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is advisable to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, and Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all seen substantial declines. Despite the downturn, there are signs of potential recovery, particularly for Dogecoin, as suggested by some analysts. Tether remains stable, with its CEO addressing regulatory pressures and reaffirming its global importance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is under significant downward pressure due to macroeconomic factors and the Bybit hack. The lack of bullish technical signals suggests reducing exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit incident, but the OTC buyback by Bybit may provide some support. Maintain a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of positive technical indicators suggest reducing exposure, although the current holding is minimal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, potential for a rebound exists, as indicated by technical analysis. Hold current position to observe further developments.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent for capital preservation and potential reallocation when market conditions improve."
2025-02-25 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has affected major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial declines. Despite the downturn, there are some signs of potential rebound, particularly for Dogecoin, as analysts suggest a possible sharp recovery. Tether remains stable, with its CEO emphasizing its importance despite facing regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant price drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: 0.0 — Although ETH has been affected by the Bybit hack, the OTC buyback by Bybit provides some support, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.2 — The sharp decline and lack of positive technical indicators suggest a cautious approach, though the current holding is minimal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite the recent drop, technical analysis indicates potential for a strong rebound, justifying a slight increase in exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides stability and liquidity, especially given the macroeconomic uncertainties."
2025-02-25 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced substantial declines, with Bitcoin hitting its lowest level since mid-November and Ethereum dropping significantly due to the Bybit hack. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen sharp declines, although there is some speculative potential for a rebound in Dogecoin. Tether remains stable, but faces regulatory pressures, highlighting its critical role in the digital currency ecosystem. In this environment, risk aversion is evident, with a potential preference for stablecoins as a safer haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The market sell-off and macroeconomic jitters have led to a significant drop in Bitcoin's price, with no immediate bullish signals. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current bearish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the recent sell-off and negative sentiment from the Bybit hack, Ethereum's OTC buyback by Bybit provides some support. However, the overall market environment remains weak, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of bullish signals suggest reducing exposure. The broader market sell-off and technical indicators do not support a positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — While Dogecoin has dropped significantly, technical analysis suggests potential rebound opportunities. Maintaining current exposure is advisable until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is sensible. It provides stability and liquidity amidst market volatility, despite regulatory concerns."

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at the Bybit exchange, which has impacted major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial declines. Despite the downturn, there is some optimism for Dogecoin, with analysts suggesting potential for a strong rebound. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, although its CEO has raised concerns about regulatory pressures. In this environment, there is a cautious approach towards risk assets, with a preference for maintaining liquidity in stablecoins like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The market sell-off and significant price drop, coupled with weak technical indicators, suggest reducing exposure to BTC in favor of more stable assets.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the recent dip and weak sentiment, the OTC purchase by Bybit indicates some underlying support, warranting a hold position.

SOL: -0.3 — The sharp decline and lack of positive signals suggest reducing exposure to SOL, especially given its recent volatility.

DOGE: +0.2 — Although DOGE has dropped, the potential for a rebound as suggested by analysts provides a slightly positive outlook, justifying a small increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for stability, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and maintain liquidity."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum has also slumped significantly due to the hack fallout. Solana has seen a sharp decline, hitting a four-month low. Despite the downturn, there are some indications of potential rebound for Dogecoin, as analysts suggest a possible sharp bounce back. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its CEO addressing regulatory pressures and reaffirming its global importance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Given the recent significant drop and negative news, reducing exposure is prudent to mitigate potential further losses.

ETH: -0.3 — The impact of the Bybit hack and weak market sentiment suggest caution, though the OTC buyback by Bybit provides a slight buffer.

SOL: -0.4 — With Solana hitting a four-month low and no immediate positive catalysts, reducing exposure aligns with the current bearish trend.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, potential for a rebound exists. Holding the current position is advisable until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is strategic for capital preservation and potential reallocation opportunities."
2025-02-25 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has affected multiple cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day dip of the year, while Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial declines. Dogecoin is down but shows potential for a rebound according to technical analysis. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with its CEO addressing potential regulatory pressures. The current environment suggests a cautious approach, with a preference for stability and risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin's significant drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given the broader market sell-off and macroeconomic pressures.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, Ethereum's repurchase by Bybit indicates some underlying support, but the overall sentiment remains weak, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline to a four-month low and lack of positive technical indicators suggest reducing exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the drop, potential for a rebound exists, but given the current bearish market sentiment, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for stability, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-25 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to substantial sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin registering its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum impacted by the fallout from the Bybit hack. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen significant price drops, though there is some speculative potential for a Dogecoin rebound. In contrast, Tether remains stable, with its CEO addressing regulatory pressures and emphasizing its global importance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sharp decline and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given the macroeconomic and security concerns.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the significant drop, the OTC purchase by Bybit indicates some underlying support, balancing the negative sentiment from the hack.

SOL: -0.3 — The sharp decline to a four-month low and lack of positive technical signals warrant a cautious stance, though the overall market context suggests potential for future recovery.

DOGE: 0.0 — While the price has dropped significantly, technical analysis suggests potential for a rebound, balancing the current bearish sentiment.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-25 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, the OTC purchase by Bybit provides some support, balancing the bearish sentiment. A neutral stance is warranted as the market digests the news.

SOL: -0.3 — The sharp decline and lack of positive momentum signals indicate caution. Reducing exposure slightly aligns with the broader market's risk-off sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the drop, there is potential for a rebound as suggested by analysts. Holding the current position is prudent until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: +0.8 — In a risk-off environment, maintaining a high allocation in USDT is advisable for capital preservation and liquidity, especially given the current market volatility."
2025-02-25 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at the Bybit exchange, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced substantial price declines, with Bitcoin seeing its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum suffering from the fallout of the Bybit hack. Solana has also been hit hard, reaching a four-month low, while Dogecoin has dropped significantly but shows potential for a rebound according to technical analysis. In contrast, Tether remains stable, with its CEO addressing regulatory pressures and reaffirming its global importance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The significant price drop and bearish macroeconomic context suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, especially given the recent hack and market sell-off.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop due to the Bybit hack, the OTC repurchase by Bybit indicates some support, warranting a neutral stance as the market digests the news.

SOL: -0.3 — The sharp decline to a four-month low amidst broader market weakness suggests reducing exposure, although the current holding is minimal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the significant drop, potential for a rebound exists according to technical analysis, justifying a hold position without further reduction.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is predominantly bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to substantial declines across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum and Solana also saw sharp declines due to the fallout from the Bybit hack. Despite these setbacks, there are hints of potential recovery for Dogecoin, according to some technical analyses. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, although its CEO has raised concerns about regulatory pressures. Overall, the market is characterized by heightened volatility and uncertainty, with a cautious outlook prevailing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is under significant selling pressure due to macroeconomic jitters and the Bybit hack. The lack of bullish technical signals and the recent large drop suggest reducing exposure.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is also affected by the Bybit incident, but the OTC repurchase by Bybit may provide some support. However, the overall sentiment remains weak, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of positive technical indicators suggest a cautious approach. The broader market sell-off further supports reducing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, analysts suggest potential for a rebound. Given the mixed signals, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of the bearish market conditions and heightened volatility, increasing exposure to USDT is advisable to preserve capital and mitigate risk."
2025-02-25 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum and Solana also faced substantial declines. Despite these downturns, there are some signs of potential recovery, particularly for Dogecoin, which analysts suggest could see a significant rebound. Tether remains stable, though it faces regulatory scrutiny, underscoring its critical role in the crypto ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — The recent significant price drop and negative news sentiment suggest a cautious approach, with potential for further downside.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, the repurchase by Bybit indicates some underlying support, balancing the negative sentiment.

SOL: -0.2 — The sharp decline and lack of positive momentum signal a need to reduce exposure, though current holdings are minimal.

DOGE: 0.2 — Despite the drop, technical analysis suggests potential for a rebound, warranting a slight positive outlook.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity."
2025-02-25 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum and Solana also suffered substantial declines. Despite the downturn, there are some signs of potential recovery, particularly for DOGE, which analysts suggest could rebound significantly. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with its CEO addressing regulatory pressures and reaffirming its importance in the digital currency ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given the current bearish market sentiment and macroeconomic pressures.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, the repurchase by Bybit indicates some underlying support. However, the overall sentiment remains weak, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — The sharp decline and lack of positive technical indicators suggest a cautious approach, with a slight reduction in exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: +0.2 — Despite the recent drop, there is potential for a rebound as indicated by technical analysis. A slight increase in allocation is justified to capture potential upside.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk, especially given its stability and global importance."
2025-02-25 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sell-off and bearish macroeconomic context suggest reducing exposure, especially given the significant price drop and lack of bullish signals.

ETH: 0.0 — Although there is no current holding, the recent dip and weak sentiment post-Bybit hack make it unattractive for new allocation at this time.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite the sharp decline, the lack of a current position and ongoing bearish sentiment suggest holding off on new allocations.

DOGE: -0.2 — While there is potential for a rebound, the recent decline and overall market conditions warrant a cautious approach, slightly reducing exposure.

USDT: +0.7 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for stability, maintaining a high exposure to USDT is prudent, despite regulatory concerns."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as U.S. tariff issues and a significant security breach at Bybit, which resulted in a $1.5 billion hack. This has led to substantial declines across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin experiencing its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum and Solana also seeing significant price decreases. Despite the downturn, there are some indications of potential rebounds, particularly for Dogecoin, where technical analysis suggests a possible sharp recovery. Tether remains stable, though there are concerns about regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin's significant price drop and lack of bullish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure, especially given the bearish macroeconomic environment and recent security breach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's price has been negatively impacted by the Bybit hack, but the OTC purchase by Bybit indicates some underlying support. Neutral stance as the market digests these developments.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the sharp price decline, Solana's bullish momentum signal suggests potential for recovery. A cautious positive allocation is warranted.

DOGE: +0.1 — While Dogecoin has dropped significantly, technical analysis indicates potential for a rebound. A slight positive allocation reflects this potential upside.

USDT: +0.7 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-25 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial declines. Despite this, there are some signs of potential recovery, particularly for Dogecoin, which analysts suggest could see a significant rebound. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable but faces regulatory scrutiny, as highlighted by its CEO's recent comments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and negative news sentiment suggest reducing exposure, despite holding a small amount.

ETH: +0.2 — Although affected by the Bybit hack, the OTC repurchase by Bybit indicates some underlying support, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: -0.3 — The sharp decline to a four-month low and lack of immediate recovery signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the decline, potential for a rebound is noted, balancing the negative sentiment with possible upside.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-25 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has led to a notable sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced substantial declines, with Bitcoin registering its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum dropping significantly due to the Bybit hack. Solana and Dogecoin have also faced sharp declines, although there are some technical indicators suggesting potential rebound opportunities for Dogecoin. Tether remains stable, but there are concerns about regulatory pressures as highlighted by its CEO. In this environment, risk aversion is prevalent, and there is a tendency to hold more stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the recent sell-off, Bitcoin's price is stabilizing, and its historical resilience suggests potential for recovery. However, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from the Bybit hack, and while there is some buying activity, the overall sentiment remains weak. Reducing exposure slightly while monitoring for stabilization.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of immediate recovery signals suggest caution. Reducing exposure to manage risk in the current bearish environment.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although Dogecoin has dropped, technical analysis indicates potential for a rebound. Maintaining current exposure while observing for further bullish signals.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of the current market volatility and bearish sentiment, increasing exposure to USDT as a safe haven to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-25 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has negatively impacted major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced substantial declines, with Bitcoin registering its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum being affected by the fallout from the Bybit hack. Solana and Dogecoin have also seen significant drops, though there is some technical analysis suggesting potential for a Dogecoin rebound. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory scrutiny, which could affect its stability in the future.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and bearish sentiment, coupled with macroeconomic pressures, suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin. The lack of bullish technical signals further supports this stance.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite some recovery efforts by Bybit, Ethereum remains under pressure from the hack fallout and weak market sentiment. The lack of strong bullish indicators suggests a cautious approach.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana has experienced a sharp decline, but its recent price increase and bullish momentum signal suggest holding the current position without further allocation.

2025-02-25 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has affected major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, falling below $90K, while Ethereum and Solana have also seen substantial declines. Despite the downturn, there are mixed signals, with some analysts suggesting potential rebounds, particularly for Dogecoin. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory pressures, underscoring its importance in the digital currency ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, especially given the bearish macroeconomic context and security concerns.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the downturn, Ethereum's OTC buyback by Bybit indicates some institutional confidence, balancing the negative sentiment from the hack fallout.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of positive technical indicators warrant a cautious approach, suggesting a reduction in exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: +0.2 — Although Dogecoin has fallen, the potential for a technical rebound and bullish projections provide a slight positive outlook, justifying a hold or small increase in allocation.

USDT: +0.7 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and mitigate risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has led to a sharp decline in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced substantial drops, with Bitcoin seeing its largest single-day dip of the year and Ethereum affected by the fallout from the Bybit hack. Solana has also faced a significant decline, reaching a four-month low. Despite the downturn, some assets like Solana and Dogecoin show signs of potential recovery due to technical indicators and analyst projections. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory pressures, but its role as a stablecoin remains crucial in the current volatile environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sell-off and macroeconomic jitters have created a bearish environment for Bitcoin, exacerbated by the Bybit hack. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current sentiment and technical indicators.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is also under pressure due to the Bybit incident, despite some recovery efforts through OTC purchases. The overall sentiment remains weak, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite the recent sharp decline, Solana's technical indicators suggest potential for a rebound. The breakout signal and bullish momentum provide a slight positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.1 — While Dogecoin has dropped, technical analysis indicates potential for a significant rebound. This warrants a modest increase in exposure, given the potential upside.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital and manage risk effectively."
2025-02-25 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has impacted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, while Ethereum has also seen a substantial decline. Solana and Dogecoin have similarly faced sharp declines, although there is some speculation about a potential rebound for Dogecoin. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory scrutiny, highlighting its importance in the digital dollar ecosystem. In this environment, risk aversion is prevalent, with a cautious approach warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is under significant pressure from macroeconomic factors and the Bybit hack, with technical indicators not showing any immediate bullish signals. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite some buying activity by Bybit, Ethereum is still affected by the hack and broader market downturn. The bullish momentum is present, but the overall sentiment remains weak, suggesting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana has shown some bullish momentum, but the recent sharp decline and lack of strong buy signals suggest a neutral stance. Monitoring for stabilization or further signals is advisable.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has dropped, there is potential for a rebound as suggested by technical analysis. A slight increase in exposure could capitalize on this potential upside, but caution is warranted.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is sensible for risk management and capital preservation, especially given the current market volatility."
2025-02-25 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant hack at Bybit, which has affected major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin experienced its largest single-day drop of the year, and Ethereum also saw a substantial decline due to the fallout from the Bybit hack. Despite these downturns, there are signs of potential recovery in some assets, such as Dogecoin, which analysts suggest could rebound sharply. Meanwhile, Solana has hit a four-month low, and Tether faces regulatory pressures but remains a critical component of the digital dollar ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant drop and bearish sentiment, compounded by macroeconomic jitters, suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin despite holding a small amount.

ETH: -0.3 — Although there is some bullish momentum, the negative impact of the Bybit hack and overall market sentiment warrants caution and a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite a recent sharp decline, the presence of bullish momentum and technical buy signals suggest a cautious increase in allocation, anticipating a potential recovery.

DOGE: +0.3 — Analysts' bullish projections and technical indicators suggest potential for a rebound, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for stability, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to manage risk and preserve capital."
2025-02-25 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns, including U.S. tariff issues and a significant $1.5 billion hack at Bybit. This has led to substantial declines across major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin experiencing its largest single-day drop of the year and Ethereum and Solana also seeing significant losses. Despite the downturn, there are some signs of potential recovery, particularly for Dogecoin, which analysts suggest could see a sharp rebound. Tether remains stable, though there are concerns about regulatory pressures. In this environment, risk aversion is high, and capital preservation is a priority.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent market sell-off and significant price drop, combined with the lack of bullish technical signals, suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin to preserve capital.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's decline due to the Bybit hack and weak market sentiment warrants a cautious approach, though some recovery efforts by Bybit provide a slight buffer.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana's sharp decline and lack of immediate recovery signals indicate a need to reduce exposure until market conditions stabilize.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite the recent drop, potential for a rebound exists, but current market conditions do not justify increasing exposure at this time.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent for capital preservation and liquidity management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is predominantly bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns and a significant security breach at Bybit, which has affected the broader crypto market. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have experienced substantial declines, with Bitcoin seeing its largest single-day drop of the year. Despite these downturns, there are some indications of potential recovery, particularly for Dogecoin, which analysts suggest could rebound significantly. Tether remains stable, though it faces regulatory pressures, highlighting its continued importance in the digital dollar ecosystem.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent significant price drop and negative news sentiment warrant a cautious approach. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's price has been heavily impacted by the Bybit hack, and while there is some recovery potential, the overall sentiment remains weak. A slight reduction in holdings is advisable.

SOL: -0.4 — Solana has experienced a sharp decline, reaching a four-month low. Although technical indicators suggest some bullish momentum, the negative news and market conditions suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: +0.2 — While Dogecoin has also dropped, technical analysis indicates potential for a strong rebound. Maintaining current holdings with a slight positive bias is recommended.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and the need for stability, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-02-26 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic despite recent volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp 5% drop due to geopolitical concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom may have been reached. Ethereum has seen significant whale activity, indicating confidence amid a price recovery attempt. Solana is struggling, hitting a five-month low with drastically reduced trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, while Tether is embroiled in legal issues, although operational improvements on the Tron network could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and the overall market sentiment may stabilize.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation signals strong confidence, and the price is attempting a recovery, making it relatively attractive.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and low trading volumes indicate weak sentiment, warranting caution in increasing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or market activity keeps sentiment neutral, with no clear direction for allocation.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market volatility, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins for risk management is prudent, despite legal challenges."
2025-02-26 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and a relatively high S&P 500 index, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp price drop due to geopolitical concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum shows signs of recovery with significant whale activity indicating confidence despite recent sell-offs. Solana is struggling with a significant price drop and reduced trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, while Tether is facing legal challenges but is also improving user experience with gas-free transfers on Tron.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drop due to tariff concerns, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, and bullish momentum is present.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale purchases and recovery attempts indicate confidence and potential for rebound, supported by bullish momentum.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price drop and reduced trading volumes indicate weak sentiment, though technical indicators remain bullish.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators; maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: -0.4 — With signs of recovery in major cryptocurrencies and potential capital rotation out of stablecoins, reducing exposure to USDT seems prudent."
2025-02-26 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some signs of recovery after recent volatility. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop due to macroeconomic concerns but seems to have reached a local bottom according to on-chain indicators. Ethereum is showing signs of recovery, bolstered by significant whale purchases, indicating confidence in its potential rebound. Solana, however, is struggling with a significant decline from its all-time high, exacerbated by a dramatic drop in trading volumes. Dogecoin has seen a recent price increase but lacks significant news to drive further momentum. Tether remains stable, with some legal challenges but also positive developments in transaction efficiency on the Tron network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain data suggests a local bottom, and bullish momentum is present. However, macroeconomic concerns warrant caution.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong buy signals from whale activity and technical indicators suggest a potential rebound, making it attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price drop and decreased trading volume indicate ongoing weakness, though existing holdings should be cautiously maintained.

DOGE: 0.0 — Recent price increase lacks substantial news support, resulting in a neutral stance until further developments.

USDT: -0.4 — With signs of recovery in major cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains in other assets is advisable."
2025-02-26 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most cryptocurrencies, despite recent volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline due to geopolitical concerns but shows signs of a local bottom, suggesting potential stabilization. Ethereum's recent whale activity indicates confidence in a recovery, despite its recent dip. Solana is facing significant challenges with a steep decline from its all-time high and a drastic drop in trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news but shows positive momentum. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with developments in its ecosystem potentially enhancing its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, and bullish momentum could signal a recovery opportunity.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and bullish momentum indicate potential for recovery, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant decline from all-time highs and reduced trading volumes suggest caution, though existing holdings should be maintained.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive momentum and lack of negative news provide a mild buy signal, but no strong catalysts are present.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintain current exposure as a hedge against volatility, given the mixed market signals and ongoing legal issues."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent volatility driven by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. tariff announcements impacting Bitcoin negatively. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline, although on-chain indicators suggest a possible local bottom. Ethereum is showing signs of recovery as significant whale purchases indicate confidence despite recent price drops. Solana is experiencing significant weakness, with trading volumes plummeting and prices hitting multi-month lows. Dogecoin has seen increased on-chain activity but lacks significant news to drive sentiment. Tether remains stable, though recent legal issues could pose risks, while upcoming improvements in transfer efficiency on Tron may enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent price drops due to macroeconomic concerns, on-chain indicators suggest a potential bottom, warranting cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale purchases and signs of price recovery indicate a positive outlook, suggesting increased allocation to capture potential rebounds.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price decline and reduced trading volumes highlight ongoing weakness, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — While on-chain activity has increased, the lack of significant news or technical signals results in a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market conditions and ongoing volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in stablecoins provides a hedge against further market downturns."
2025-02-26 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with bearish undertones, primarily driven by macroeconomic concerns such as U.S. tariff announcements impacting Bitcoin, which saw a notable price drop. Ethereum shows signs of potential recovery, bolstered by significant whale activity, suggesting confidence despite recent volatility. Solana is experiencing a sharp decline in both price and trading volume, indicating weak market sentiment. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news to drive its price. Meanwhile, Tether is facing legal challenges, but its role as a stablecoin remains crucial amid market uncertainty. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a high U.S. dollar index and moderate volatility, suggest a cautious market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the recent price drop due to macroeconomic concerns and heavy selling pressure suggests caution. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current volatility.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong whale buying activity and signs of recovery from a recent dip indicate potential upside. Maintaining a positive allocation reflects confidence in its rebound potential.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and a sharp drop in trading volumes highlight weak sentiment. Reducing exposure is advisable until market conditions stabilize.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate. The asset remains relatively stable.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish signals in other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."
2025-02-26 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp price drop due to geopolitical concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum shows signs of recovery as significant whale purchases indicate confidence despite recent volatility. Solana is facing significant downward pressure with a substantial drop from its all-time high, exacerbated by declining trading volumes. Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news, while Tether is caught in legal disputes, but operational improvements are expected with upcoming gas-free transfers on Tron.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, the potential local bottom and bullish momentum suggest a cautious buy signal. The geopolitical risks warrant a conservative approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong buy signals from whale activity and technical indicators suggest a recovery potential, making ETH relatively attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — The significant drop from its all-time high and declining trading volumes indicate caution. Current holdings should be reduced slightly given the weak sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining the current position is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential capital rotation into riskier assets and upcoming operational improvements, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows a mixed environment with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and moderate volatility, which can impact risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp price drop due to geopolitical concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom, indicating a possible recovery. Ethereum shows signs of confidence from large investors despite recent volatility, while Solana is struggling with significant declines in both price and trading volume, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, while Tether is involved in legal disputes but is also making technical improvements to its network.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop due to tariff concerns, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and bullish momentum indicators support a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Strong buying by whales and a potential price recovery signal confidence in ETH, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant price and volume declines indicate weak sentiment, and the asset is less attractive compared to others, warranting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, DOGE remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential recovery in other assets and the ongoing legal issues, reducing exposure to USDT is prudent to capitalize on risk assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing bullish technical indicators despite recent price volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline due to macroeconomic factors, but on-chain data suggests a potential local bottom, indicating possible recovery. Ethereum shows signs of confidence from large investors, despite recent price dips. Solana is struggling with significant price and volume declines, reflecting weak sentiment. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news impacting its market. Tether's stability is maintained, but legal issues could affect sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops due to external factors, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and bullish technical indicators support a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Large purchases by whale investors and attempts at price recovery indicate confidence, making ETH relatively attractive for increased allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Significant decline in price and trading volume suggests weak sentiment, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data suggests maintaining current exposure without adjustment.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential recovery signals in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on riskier assets."
2025-02-26 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp price drop due to macroeconomic concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum shows signs of recovery with significant whale activity indicating confidence despite recent volatility. Solana is under pressure, having hit a five-month low, and its trading volumes have plummeted, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin has seen price increases without significant news, suggesting speculative interest. Tether remains stable, but legal challenges could introduce uncertainty. In this environment, risk assets like BTC and ETH show potential for recovery, while SOL remains under pressure. USDT provides a safe haven amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price drops due to tariff concerns, on-chain data suggests a local bottom, presenting a buying opportunity as the market stabilizes.

ETH: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and a rebound from oversold conditions indicate potential upside, making ETH attractive for capital allocation.

SOL: -0.2 — Continued weakness and low trading volumes suggest caution; however, the current holding is minimal, so a slight reduction is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and speculative price movements, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: -0.3 — With potential recovery in risk assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on market opportunities."
2025-02-26 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline due to macroeconomic concerns, specifically the announcement of new U.S. tariffs, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum is showing signs of recovery after a significant dip, with notable whale purchases indicating confidence. Solana is under pressure, having hit a five-month low with drastically reduced trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its market. Tether is facing legal challenges, but the announcement of gas-free transfers on Tron could improve its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops due to tariff concerns, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and the overall trend remains bullish.

ETH: +0.5 — Recovery signals and whale purchases indicate confidence and potential for upward movement, making it relatively attractive.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price decline and reduced trading volumes suggest weak sentiment, warranting a cautious approach to holding.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price action suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.2 — While legal issues present some risk, the potential for increased utility with gas-free transfers on Tron suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings as risk appetite may increase."
2025-02-26 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum shows signs of recovery after a significant dip, supported by large purchases from whale investors.

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops due to macroeconomic concerns, on-chain data suggests a local bottom, and the potential for recovery is present. 

ETH: +0.5 — Strong whale accumulation and signs of price recovery indicate confidence and potential upside, making it relatively attractive.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and reduced trading volumes signal weak sentiment and potential further downside, warranting caution.

2025-02-26 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 19.1, and a strong U.S. dollar index at 106.42. The broader market sentiment is cautious, influenced by geopolitical tensions such as the U.S. imposing tariffs on the EU, which has negatively impacted Bitcoin, causing a sharp 5% drop. Ethereum, despite a significant price dip, has seen confidence from large investors, suggesting potential recovery. Solana is experiencing a severe downturn with a significant drop in trading volumes and price, indicating weak sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, Tether's legal issues and upcoming improvements in transfer efficiency on Tron present a mixed outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent sharp price drop due to tariff concerns and heavy selling pressure suggests caution. Reduce exposure slightly to manage risk.

**ETH: +0.2** — The confidence shown by whale investors and potential price recovery indicate a moderate buy signal, although the recent volatility warrants careful monitoring.

**SOL: -0.5** — The significant price drop and collapse in trading volumes suggest a bearish outlook. Reduce exposure due to weak market sentiment and technical breakdown.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintain a neutral stance on Dogecoin.

**USDT: +0.6** — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment in other assets, increasing exposure to USDT is prudent for capital preservation and risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic concerns such as U.S. tariffs impacting Bitcoin and broader market volatility. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline due to these external pressures, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum has also seen significant sell-offs, although whale activity indicates some confidence in a rebound. Solana is underperforming significantly, with a dramatic drop in both price and trading volume, reflecting weak market sentiment and reduced on-chain activity. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether remains stable but faces legal challenges, although upcoming improvements in transaction costs on the Tron network could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the recent price drop, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and the market may stabilize. Maintain a cautious positive outlook.

ETH: +0.1 — Whale purchases indicate confidence, but recent price volatility warrants a cautious approach. Potential for recovery exists.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price and volume declines, coupled with weak sentiment, suggest reducing exposure until conditions improve.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data keeps DOGE in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the current bearish market conditions and volatility, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent for risk management."
2025-02-26 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with significant volatility and recent declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp price drop due to geopolitical concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum, despite a recent crash, is seeing interest from large investors, indicating possible confidence in a rebound. Solana is facing significant challenges with a steep decline from its all-time high and a drastic reduction in trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news impacting its market. Tether is facing legal challenges, but the upcoming ""gas-free"" transfer feature on Tron could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and BTC remains a core asset in the portfolio. However, caution is warranted due to external geopolitical factors.

ETH: +0.2 — The interest from whale investors indicates confidence in ETH's recovery potential, but technical indicators are mixed, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and reduced trading volumes signal weak sentiment and potential further downside, justifying a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, maintaining a neutral stance on DOGE is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, especially with upcoming improvements in transfer efficiency."
2025-02-26 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, with the S&P 500 and gold prices showing resilience. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline due to geopolitical concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential bottom. Ethereum is showing signs of recovery, bolstered by significant whale purchases, indicating confidence in its value. Solana is facing significant challenges, with a drastic drop in trading volumes and a steep decline from its all-time high. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether is navigating legal challenges but is set to improve user experience with gas-free transfers on Tron.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and the macro environment remains supportive for a recovery.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and signs of price recovery indicate a positive outlook, suggesting potential for upside movement.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant decline in price and trading volume, coupled with weak sentiment, suggests caution is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price movement suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.2 — While still a safe haven, the potential for recovery in BTC and ETH suggests a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on risk assets."
2025-02-26 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is mixed with a bearish tilt, largely influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the recent U.S. tariff concerns, which have contributed to a sharp decline in Bitcoin's price. Despite this, there are signs of potential recovery in some assets, as indicated by on-chain activity and strategic buying by large holders. Bitcoin has experienced significant selling pressure, suggesting a possible local bottom. Ethereum has seen strategic accumulation by whales, indicating confidence despite recent price drops. Solana is facing significant challenges with a sharp decline in trading volumes and price, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable without significant news. Tether's legal issues may affect its stability, but developments like gas-free transfers on Tron could enhance its utility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent price drops due to macroeconomic concerns, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, and there is potential for recovery.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation during the sell-off indicates confidence in Ethereum's recovery potential, despite recent price volatility.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant decline in trading volumes and price, coupled with weak sentiment, suggests caution is warranted.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market uncertainty and potential for further volatility, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer and flexibility for future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop due to geopolitical concerns, specifically U.S. tariff announcements, which contributed to a broader market downturn. Ethereum, despite its price drop, saw some confidence from large investors, suggesting potential stabilization. Solana has been hit hard, with its price down significantly from its all-time high, compounded by a dramatic decrease in trading volumes. Meanwhile, DOGE has seen no significant news, and USDT remains relatively stable, with some legal challenges potentially impacting sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite reaching a potential local bottom, the recent sharp price drop and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. Current holdings should be reduced slightly.

ETH: +0.2 — While ETH has faced a significant sell-off, the confidence shown by large investors (whales) indicates potential for recovery, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.7 — The substantial drop from its all-time high, coupled with plummeting trading volumes, suggests a weak outlook. Given current holdings, exposure should be reduced.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. Current holdings should be maintained without change.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent for capital preservation and potential future opportunities."
2025-02-26 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, notably BTC and ETH, which have experienced sharp drops due to macroeconomic concerns such as U.S. tariff announcements. Bitcoin's recent price drop has been exacerbated by heavy selling from short-term holders, although on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum has seen some confidence from large investors despite its recent crash, indicating potential for a recovery. Solana is experiencing a significant downturn, with its trading volumes plummeting, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with upcoming improvements in transaction costs on the Tron network, despite ongoing legal challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the recent price drop, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, and the possibility of a rebound exists. However, caution is warranted due to macroeconomic pressures.

ETH: +0.1 — The purchase by a whale group indicates confidence in ETH's recovery potential, but recent price volatility suggests a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.1 — Significant price decline and reduced trading volumes indicate weak sentiment, though the current portfolio exposure is minimal.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data suggests maintaining a neutral position.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2025-02-26 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. This downturn is exacerbated by macroeconomic concerns, such as U.S. tariff announcements impacting BTC and broader market volatility. Despite the negative sentiment, there are signs of potential stabilization, particularly for BTC and ETH, with on-chain data suggesting a local bottom for BTC and whale activity indicating confidence in ETH. SOL is experiencing a sharp decline due to reduced on-chain activity and trading volumes, while DOGE lacks significant news or positive momentum. USDT remains stable, with some bullish momentum, possibly due to its safe-haven status amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, on-chain indicators suggest a local bottom, and the market may stabilize. Maintain some exposure given potential recovery signals.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale purchases during the sell-off indicate confidence, suggesting a potential rebound. However, maintain caution due to recent volatility.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant declines in price and trading volume, coupled with weak sentiment, warrant reducing exposure to SOL.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or positive momentum keeps DOGE in a neutral position. Hold current exposure without increasing.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-26 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop due to geopolitical concerns, specifically U.S. tariff announcements, although on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum has seen substantial buying from whale groups despite recent sell-offs, indicating some confidence in a recovery. Solana is facing significant challenges, with a steep decline from its all-time high and a drastic reduction in trading volumes, reflecting weak market sentiment. Dogecoin has shown some price recovery, but lacks significant news or developments. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with ongoing legal issues but potential improvements in user experience through Tron’s gas-free transfers.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and geopolitical concerns may have already been priced in. However, caution is warranted due to market volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation during the sell-off indicates confidence in a rebound, and the recent price recovery suggests potential upside.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and reduced trading volumes highlight weak sentiment and potential further downside, warranting reduced exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed price movements suggest a neutral stance, with no clear direction.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-26 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by significant volatility and mixed signals. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline due to macroeconomic factors such as U.S. tariff announcements, but on-chain indicators suggest a potential local bottom. Ethereum shows some resilience with whale accumulation, indicating confidence despite recent price drops. Solana is struggling with a significant drop from its all-time high and reduced trading volumes, reflecting weak sentiment. Dogecoin has seen a slight increase in activity but lacks significant news to drive momentum. Tether remains stable, though legal challenges could pose risks. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious with a preference for stability, as indicated by the strong USDT holdings.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, and the market may be oversold, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and price recovery attempts indicate confidence and potential for a rebound, making ETH relatively attractive.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and reduced trading volumes reflect weak sentiment and potential further downside, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and only slight improvements in activity lead to a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market volatility and mixed signals, maintaining a strong USDT position for stability is prudent, though a slight reduction is considered to capitalize on potential rebounds in BTC and ETH."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some assets showing signs of recovery while others remain under pressure. Bitcoin has experienced a sharp drop due to geopolitical concerns, but on-chain indicators suggest it might have reached a local bottom. Ethereum shows signs of recovery, bolstered by significant whale purchases despite a recent price dip. Solana is struggling with a significant decline from its all-time high, exacerbated by plummeting trading volumes. Dogecoin lacks significant news, but its recent price movements indicate some positive momentum. Tether remains stable, with developments around gas-free transfers on Tron potentially improving its utility, though legal challenges persist.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price drops due to geopolitical issues, on-chain data suggests a potential bottom, making it moderately attractive for accumulation.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale activity and a rebound from overselling indicate a potential recovery, warranting a positive allocation score.

SOL: 0.0 — Significant price drop and low trading volumes suggest caution; maintain a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: +0.2 — Recent price increases and activity surges suggest some positive momentum, though lacking strong news support.

USDT: -0.2 — With some signs of recovery in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-02-26 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently cautious with a bearish tilt, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the U.S. tariff concerns, which have negatively impacted Bitcoin. Despite this, some assets like Ethereum show signs of recovery, driven by strategic purchases from significant market players. Solana is experiencing a sharp decline in both price and trading volume, indicating a lack of confidence and activity. Meanwhile, Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news affecting its market position. Tether continues to be a stable option amidst market volatility, although legal issues may pose a risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent price drop due to U.S. tariff concerns and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale purchases indicate potential recovery and confidence, making it relatively more attractive despite recent volatility.

SOL: -0.8 — Significant price drop and declining trading volumes suggest reducing exposure due to weak market sentiment and activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — Stable price and lack of significant news or technical signals suggest maintaining current position without changes.

USDT: +0.6 — In a cautious market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."
2025-02-27 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant sell-offs observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day decline since November 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, triggering liquidations and reinforcing bearish sentiment. Solana has seen a dramatic 50% drop from its January peaks, with potential for further downside if critical support levels fail. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a shift of liquidity towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.5** — The recent sharp sell-off and lack of bullish signals suggest continued downside risk. Holding some BTC is prudent, but reducing exposure aligns with the bearish macro environment.

**ETH: -0.3** — Breaking key support levels and ongoing bearish sentiment indicate further downside potential. Reducing exposure is advisable while monitoring for any stabilization.

**SOL: 0.0** — Despite the massive drop, Solana's current price range and potential for further decline suggest a cautious hold. No strong signals to increase or decrease exposure significantly.

**DOGE: -0.4** — With declining interest and legal scrutiny, reducing exposure is warranted. The asset's volatility and external pressures make it less attractive in the current market.

**USDT: +0.5** — In a bearish market, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure is strategic. The outflows from exchanges suggest liquidity movement, but USDT remains a safe haven for capital preservation."
2025-02-27 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day decline since late 2022, while Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has also seen a dramatic drop, exacerbated by a memecoin crash, and analysts warn of potential further declines. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges linked to high-profile figures. In contrast, Tether has seen significant outflows, indicating a potential shift in liquidity towards decentralized platforms amidst the broader market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sharp sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given the macroeconomic pressures and weakened demand.

ETH: -0.6 — Ethereum's technical breakdown and bearish sentiment, coupled with macro pressures, indicate a need to reduce holdings further.

SOL: -0.4 — Despite a slight bullish momentum signal, the significant price drop and bearish chart patterns suggest caution and a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — The decline in investor interest and legal scrutiny, alongside a lack of positive technical signals, warrant a cautious reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure is prudent, given its stability and the observed capital rotation towards decentralized platforms."
2025-02-27 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, characterized by significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and macroeconomic pressures. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, while Ethereum has broken key support levels, indicating potential continued downside. Solana has also seen a sharp decline, with analysts warning of further drops if critical support fails. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, suggesting a market rotation towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent price increase, the overall trend remains bearish with significant sell-offs and no strong buy signals from technical indicators. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum's technical breakdown and bearish sentiment suggest further downside potential. Reducing exposure is prudent given the macro pressures and recent price action.

SOL: +0.2 — Although Solana has experienced a significant decline, the recent price increase and bullish momentum signal suggest a potential short-term recovery. A cautious increase in allocation is warranted.

DOGE: -0.1 — Legal scrutiny and reduced trading interest present risks, but recent price increases and bullish momentum provide some support. Maintain current holdings with a slight reduction.

USDT: +0.6 — With the market downturn and capital rotation towards decentralized platforms, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity in uncertain conditions."
2025-02-27 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly bearish, with significant sell-offs observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest decline since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has seen a dramatic 50% drop from its January peaks, with technical patterns suggesting further downside risk. Dogecoin is facing declining investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential shift towards decentralized platforms amidst the downturn. Overall, the market is characterized by risk-off sentiment, with macroeconomic pressures and regulatory concerns weighing heavily on crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some stabilization, Bitcoin's significant recent sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The macroeconomic environment and reduced institutional demand further support a conservative stance.

ETH: -0.6 — Ethereum's break below key support levels and continued bearish technical indicators warrant a reduction in exposure. The macro pressure and bearish sentiment reinforce this view.

SOL: -0.7 — Solana's sharp decline and potential for further downside, as indicated by technical patterns, suggest a strong sell signal. The broader risk-off environment exacerbates the negative outlook.

DOGE: -0.4 — Declining open interest and trading volume, along with legal scrutiny, indicate waning investor interest. While not as severe as SOL, the sentiment remains negative.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent. The outflows from exchanges suggest a shift towards safety and liquidity, making USDT relatively attractive."
2025-02-27 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a bearish tilt, influenced by macroeconomic pressures and recent negative news. Bitcoin has experienced a significant sell-off, the largest since late 2022, due to tightening liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has also faced bearish pressure, breaking key support levels and triggering substantial liquidations. Solana has seen a sharp decline, driven by broader risk-off sentiment and technical warnings of further potential drops. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is experiencing large outflows, indicating a potential rotation towards decentralized platforms amidst a broader market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite recent bullish momentum, the significant sell-off and negative news suggest caution. Holding a small position is prudent given the current market conditions.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued bearish sentiment and technical breakdowns indicate potential further downside. Reducing exposure is advisable.

SOL: 0.0 — Although there is some bullish momentum, the recent sharp decline and potential for further drops warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — Legal issues and declining interest suggest a cautious approach. Reducing exposure slightly is recommended.

USDT: +0.5 — With market uncertainty and capital outflows from other assets, maintaining a higher USDT position provides stability and liquidity."
2025-02-27 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant downward pressure across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish channel, while Solana has suffered a dramatic 50% crash from its January peaks, with potential for further declines. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal issues, contributing to a negative outlook. Meanwhile, Tether is experiencing large outflows, suggesting a liquidity shift towards decentralized platforms amid the broader market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the recent sharp sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest a cautious approach. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.6 — Breaking critical support levels and reinforcing a bearish channel indicate further downside risk. Reduce exposure given the bearish sentiment.

SOL: -0.4 — The significant crash and potential for further declines warrant a reduction in exposure, despite some bullish momentum signals.

DOGE: -0.3 — With declining investor interest and legal scrutiny, it's prudent to reduce exposure, although the momentum remains slightly positive.

USDT: +0.8 — Given the bearish market conditions and large outflows from other assets, increasing USDT allocation is a safe haven strategy to preserve capital."
2025-02-27 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant downward pressure across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook, while Solana has seen a dramatic 50% drop from its January peaks, with analysts warning of potential further declines. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, adding to its negative sentiment. Meanwhile, USDT is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential market rotation towards decentralized platforms amid the broader downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some bullish momentum indicators, the recent sharp sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest caution. Reducing exposure is prudent given the bearish sentiment.

ETH: -0.3 — Breaking key support levels and continued bearish sentiment warrant a reduction in exposure. The technical breakdown points to potential further downside.

SOL: -0.7 — Significant price drop and warnings of further declines make Solana unattractive at this time. Reducing exposure is necessary to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — With declining open interest and legal challenges, Dogecoin's outlook is negative. Reducing exposure is advisable given the fading investor attention.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent. The outflows suggest some market rotation, but USDT remains a safer haven amid volatility."
2025-02-27 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. dollar, which often pressures risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant three-day sell-off, the largest since late 2022, driven by reduced liquidity and institutional demand. Ethereum has also faced bearish pressure, breaking key support levels. Solana has seen a drastic decline, exacerbated by broader market risk-off sentiment and specific issues within the ecosystem. Dogecoin is experiencing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, suggesting a shift in liquidity towards decentralized platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.4 — Despite some stabilization, Bitcoin's recent sharp sell-off and lack of strong buy signals suggest caution. The macro environment remains challenging.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's technical breakdown and bearish sentiment indicate potential for further downside, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's severe price drop and potential for further declines make it less attractive, especially given the risk-off market conditions.

DOGE: -0.2 — Legal issues and declining interest reduce its appeal, although the impact is less severe compared to other assets.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish environment with significant outflows from other assets, maintaining or increasing stablecoin holdings provides a safer position."
2025-02-27 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment remains bearish, with significant downward pressure on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Solana has also seen a dramatic decline, with potential for further downside if critical support levels fail. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal scrutiny, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential shift in liquidity towards decentralized platforms.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent bullish momentum indicators, the significant sell-off and weakened institutional demand suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: -0.4 — Breaking key support levels and ongoing bearish sentiment indicate further downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent.

SOL: -0.2 — Although there is short-term bullish momentum, the recent sharp decline and potential for further drops warrant a cautious approach.

DOGE: -0.1 — Legal issues and declining investor interest suggest a need to slightly reduce holdings, despite some bullish technical signals.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the bearish market conditions and large outflows, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment reflects a bearish outlook across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic pressures and specific asset-related challenges. Bitcoin has experienced a significant sell-off, marking its largest decline since late 2022, due to tightening fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Solana has seen a dramatic drop, exacerbated by a memecoin crash and broader risk-off sentiment, with technical patterns suggesting further downside risk. Dogecoin faces declining investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing significant outflows, indicating a shift towards decentralized platforms amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent sharp declines and weakened institutional demand suggest caution. Maintain exposure but reduce slightly given the bearish macro context.

ETH: -0.3 — Breaking key support levels and ongoing bearish sentiment warrant a cautious stance. Reduce exposure slightly to manage downside risk.

SOL: -0.7 — Significant price drop and potential for further declines necessitate a reduction in exposure. The technical outlook is particularly concerning.

DOGE: -0.4 — Declining interest and legal issues around Musk-linked operations suggest reducing exposure, despite holding the asset.

USDT: +0.5 — With market uncertainty and capital rotation towards decentralized platforms, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-02-27 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by significant sell-offs and macroeconomic pressures. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day decline since late 2022, and Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish expectations. Solana has seen a dramatic drop, with potential for further declines, while Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by high volatility and risk-off sentiment, is contributing to these declines. Meanwhile, Tether is seeing large outflows, indicating a possible rotation of capital towards decentralized platforms amidst the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some technical buy signals, the sharp recent sell-off and weakened institutional demand suggest caution and potential further downside.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum's break below key support levels and bearish sentiment indicate a need to reduce exposure, despite some bullish technical signals.

SOL: -0.6 — The significant price drop and warnings of further declines suggest a strong need to reduce exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — Legal scrutiny and declining investor interest warrant a reduction in exposure, as the asset lacks positive momentum.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish environment with high volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."
2025-02-27 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic pressures and specific negative news events. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, reflecting tightening liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish sentiment, while Solana has crashed significantly, with potential for further declines. Dogecoin faces dwindling investor interest and legal challenges, adding to its negative outlook. Meanwhile, Tether is seeing large outflows, suggesting a shift in liquidity amid the broader market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the recent sell-off, BTC shows some stabilization, and technical indicators remain bullish, suggesting a cautious buy signal.

ETH: -0.5 — Breaking key support levels and ongoing bearish sentiment indicate further downside risk, warranting reduced exposure.

SOL: -0.7 — Significant price crash and potential for further declines make SOL less attractive, suggesting a strong reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — Decreased trading volume and legal issues surrounding DOGE contribute to a negative outlook, recommending a reduction in holdings.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides stability and liquidity, making it a preferred asset for capital preservation."
2025-02-27 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, primarily due to tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish sentiment, while Solana has crashed significantly, driven by broader risk-off pressures and a memecoin crash. Dogecoin is seeing reduced investor interest, with a sharp drop in derivatives open interest and trading volume, compounded by legal scrutiny. Meanwhile, Tether is experiencing large outflows, indicating a potential rotation of liquidity towards decentralized platforms amidst the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the significant recent sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest continued downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: -0.6 — Breaking key support levels and triggering long-liquidations highlight bearish sentiment and potential for further declines. Reducing exposure is advisable.

SOL: -0.7 — The substantial price drop and warnings of further declines make Solana particularly risky in the current environment. Reducing exposure is recommended.

DOGE: -0.3 — With declining investor interest and legal challenges, Dogecoin faces headwinds that warrant a cautious reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-02-27 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook, while Solana has plunged significantly due to broader risk-off pressure and specific market events. Dogecoin is also facing declining investor interest and legal challenges, further dampening its outlook. Meanwhile, Tether is experiencing large outflows, indicating a potential rotation of liquidity towards decentralized platforms amidst the broader downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish technical signals, the recent sharp sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest caution. Holding a small position but reducing exposure due to potential further downside.

ETH: -0.6 — Breaking key support levels and bearish news sentiment indicate a continued downward trend. Reducing exposure as downside risks remain high.

SOL: -0.7 — Significant price crash and bearish chart patterns suggest further declines. Reducing exposure due to high volatility and risk of additional losses.

DOGE: -0.4 — Declining open interest and legal issues create a negative outlook. Reducing exposure as investor interest wanes.

USDT: +0.8 — With the current bearish market sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity. The recent outflows suggest a cautious approach, but it remains a safe haven amidst market volatility."
2025-02-27 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic pressures and specific asset-related issues. Bitcoin has experienced its largest sell-off since late 2022, primarily due to tightening fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum is facing bearish technical indicators after breaking a key support level, while Solana has seen a dramatic crash, exacerbated by a memecoin collapse and risk-off sentiment. Dogecoin is experiencing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a possible shift towards decentralized platforms amid the broader market downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price stabilization, the significant sell-off and reduced institutional demand suggest caution. The macroeconomic context and news indicate potential further downside.

ETH: -0.4 — The break below key support levels and bearish technical outlook warrant a reduction in exposure, especially given the macro pressures and recent sell-off.

SOL: -0.5 — The sharp decline and potential for further drops, as indicated by chart patterns, suggest a need to reduce exposure significantly.

DOGE: -0.2 — With declining open interest and legal issues, DOGE is less attractive, though the score is moderated by its relatively low current portfolio weight.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and capital rotation towards decentralized platforms, maintaining higher USDT exposure is prudent for liquidity and risk management."
2025-02-27 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced its largest sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum is facing bearish pressure after breaking key support levels, while Solana has crashed significantly due to broader risk-off sentiment and specific market events. Dogecoin is seeing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is experiencing outflows as liquidity shifts towards decentralized platforms. The macroeconomic context, with high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, further supports a cautious approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some stabilization, the recent sharp sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest caution. Maintain reduced exposure.

ETH: -0.4 — Continued bearish sentiment and technical breakdowns indicate potential further downside. Reduce exposure.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and potential for further drops warrant a cautious stance. Reduce exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Reduced investor interest and legal scrutiny suggest maintaining a lower allocation. Reduce exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-02-27 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies driven by macroeconomic pressures and specific asset-related challenges. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, exacerbated by tightening fiat liquidity and reduced institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Solana has seen a dramatic decline, with warnings of further potential drops due to broader risk-off pressures and specific technical patterns. Dogecoin faces reduced investor interest and legal challenges, further dampening its outlook. Meanwhile, Tether is witnessing significant outflows, suggesting a shift towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent sharp sell-off and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. Current holdings should be reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: -0.6 — Breaking key support levels and ongoing bearish sentiment indicate further downside potential. Reducing exposure is prudent.

SOL: -0.7 — Significant price drop and technical warnings of further declines necessitate a reduction in holdings to manage risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — Declining interest and legal scrutiny contribute to a negative outlook. Reducing exposure is advisable given current holdings.

USDT: +0.8 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity, aligning with the observed market rotation into stable assets."
2025-02-27 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, marked by significant declines in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and macroeconomic pressures. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, while Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has seen a dramatic price drop, exacerbated by broader risk-off sentiment and technical breakdowns. Dogecoin faces declining investor interest and legal challenges, further dampening its outlook. Meanwhile, Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential rotation of capital towards decentralized platforms amid the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite a recent price increase, the overall sentiment remains bearish with significant sell-offs and no strong buy signals from technical indicators. Current macroeconomic pressures and liquidity issues further support reducing exposure.

ETH: -0.6 — Ethereum is under significant bearish pressure with technical breakdowns and a failure to maintain key support levels. The recent sell-off and macroeconomic challenges suggest a need to reduce exposure.

SOL: -0.7 — Solana's sharp decline and potential for further downside, as indicated by technical patterns, warrant a reduction in exposure. The risk-off environment and memecoin crash add to the negative sentiment.

DOGE: -0.4 — With declining open interest, trading volume, and legal scrutiny, Dogecoin faces a challenging environment. The lack of positive momentum suggests reducing exposure.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent. The outflows from exchanges suggest a shift towards decentralized platforms, but USDT remains a safer allocation in the current climate."
2025-02-27 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Bitcoin has experienced its largest decline since late 2022, while Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing bearish expectations. Solana has seen a dramatic drop, exacerbated by broader risk-off sentiment, and Dogecoin faces declining investor interest and legal challenges. Meanwhile, Tether is witnessing large outflows, indicating a potential shift in liquidity towards decentralized platforms amidst the downturn.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent sharp sell-off and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The macroeconomic environment remains challenging, and the asset's recent stabilization does not yet indicate a reversal.

ETH: -0.3 — Continued bearish sentiment and technical breakdowns below key support levels suggest further downside risk. No current holdings allow for a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.7 — Significant price drop and negative news indicate high risk. The potential for further declines makes reducing exposure prudent.

DOGE: -0.4 — Declining open interest and legal issues surrounding Musk-linked operations contribute to a negative outlook. Reducing exposure is advisable given the lack of positive catalysts.

USDT: +0.9 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a high allocation in USDT is preferable for capital preservation and liquidity, especially with ongoing market volatility and risk aversion."
2025-02-27 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Example:

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is predominantly bearish, with significant downward pressure on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced its largest three-day sell-off since late 2022, driven by tightening fiat liquidity and weakened institutional demand. Ethereum has broken key support levels, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Solana has seen a dramatic decline, with analysts predicting further potential downside. Dogecoin is facing reduced investor interest and legal challenges, while Tether is experiencing large outflows, indicating a shift in liquidity towards decentralized platforms. Overall, the market is characterized by risk-off sentiment, with volatility and macroeconomic pressures contributing to cautious investor behavior.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a recent stabilization, the significant sell-off and bearish macroeconomic context suggest caution. The current holding should be slightly reduced.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's recent technical breakdown and bearish sentiment warrant a neutral stance, avoiding exposure until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.5 — The substantial price drop and potential for further declines justify reducing exposure, especially given the already held position.

DOGE: -0.2 — Legal scrutiny and declining interest suggest reducing exposure, but the position is small enough to warrant only a slight reduction.

USDT: +0.6 — In a risk-off environment with significant market volatility, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent to preserve capital and liquidity."
