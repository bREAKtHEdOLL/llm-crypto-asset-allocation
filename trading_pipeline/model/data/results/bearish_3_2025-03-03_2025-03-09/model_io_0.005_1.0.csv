2025-03-03 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously bullish, driven by recent news of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This announcement has led to significant price rallies for these assets, indicating renewed investor confidence and bullish sentiment. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE show consistent buy signals with bullish momentum, although there was a notable price retracement in the last hour. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a mixed environment where investors may still seek safety in stablecoins like USDT, but the recent news has shifted some focus back to riskier crypto assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the recent price retracement, BTC shows strong upward momentum and increased on-chain activity, supported by bullish news regarding its inclusion in the strategic reserve.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH has benefitted from the strategic reserve news, showing strong technical indicators and increased transaction activity, although the recent price drop tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: +0.5 — SOL's inclusion in the strategic reserve has also spurred a rally, with strong technical indicators and increased volume supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Without significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral, with no clear direction for capital allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite following the strategic reserve news, there is a moderate preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT and into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement has led to a notable rally in these assets, although some of the initial gains have retraced. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, and SOL show strong buy signals with bullish momentum, supported by increased on-chain activity. DOGE, despite lacking specific news, has also shown positive price action and technical indicators. USDT remains stable, with no significant buy signals, suggesting a potential capital rotation into riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and on-chain activity, coupled with bullish sentiment from the strategic reserve news, suggest increased allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the strategic reserve news and shows strong technical and on-chain indicators, justifying a positive allocation score.

SOL: +0.6 — The strategic reserve news has positively impacted SOL, with strong technical indicators supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Despite no specific news, DOGE's technical indicators are positive, and the overall market bullishness warrants a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With the bullish sentiment and strong buy signals across other assets, a reduction in USDT holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2025-03-03 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The market is experiencing a positive sentiment driven by the announcement of a U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, leading to significant price surges for these assets. Despite the retracement of initial gains, the market remains bullish, supported by technical indicators showing strong momentum and buy signals across BTC, ETH, and SOL. Dogecoin and USDT have not seen significant news or technical changes, with DOGE maintaining a steady trend and USDT showing no bullish signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals and bullish momentum, supported by positive news regarding its inclusion in the strategic reserve. The market sentiment remains optimistic, with increased interest in high-value call options.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to BTC, Ethereum benefits from its inclusion in the strategic reserve, with strong buy signals and bullish momentum. The market sentiment is positive, although not as strong as BTC due to the lack of additional news.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana has experienced a significant price increase due to its inclusion in the strategic reserve. The technical indicators support a bullish outlook, although the momentum is slightly less pronounced compared to BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators. The asset remains stable with normal activity, and there is no clear signal to adjust the current holding.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market showing a bullish trend and increased risk appetite, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher growth potential."
2025-03-03 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This has led to significant price surges in these assets, although the initial rallies have somewhat retraced. Technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and SOL remain positive, with buy signals and bullish momentum evident. DOGE and USDT have not been influenced by any significant news, and their technical indicators suggest a more neutral stance. The macroeconomic environment, with stable interest rates and a relatively high volatility index, suggests a mixed backdrop for risk assets, but the strategic reserve news has injected optimism into the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve and strong technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for BTC. Despite the retracement, the bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity support a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the reserve news and maintains bullish technical indicators. The lack of additional news does not detract from the positive sentiment generated by the strategic reserve inclusion.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's inclusion in the strategic reserve has driven a significant price increase, supported by strong technical indicators. The absence of further news is offset by the positive momentum from the reserve announcement.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains a neutral hold. The lack of a clear catalyst or momentum suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — As the market sentiment shifts towards riskier assets due to the strategic reserve news, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely. This suggests reducing exposure to USDT in favor of more volatile assets with higher potential upside."
2025-03-03 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by the recent announcement of a U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This announcement has sparked significant price rallies across these assets, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. However, the market has seen some retracement following the initial surge. Technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and SOL remain positive, with buy signals from moving averages and bullish momentum, though recent hourly data shows mixed price movements. DOGE and USDT have not been directly impacted by the news, and their technical indicators suggest a more neutral stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent retracement, BTC maintains a positive trend and bullish momentum, supported by strategic reserve news. However, caution is warranted due to mixed short-term price movements.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from inclusion in the strategic reserve, with positive technical indicators. The lack of additional news keeps the score moderate.

SOL: +0.5 — SOL's inclusion in the strategic reserve has driven a price rally, and technical indicators remain favorable. Volume and on-chain activity are stable, supporting a positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. Its recent price decreases suggest caution, but no strong signals justify a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases due to bullish news for other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified. However, maintaining some stablecoin exposure is prudent given market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by significant news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement has led to substantial price surges in these assets, indicating renewed investor confidence and potential upside momentum. Despite the recent retracement in prices, the market remains optimistic, as evidenced by the increased open interest in BTC call options. Meanwhile, DOGE and USDT have not experienced significant news or price movements, suggesting a relatively stable outlook for these assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The announcement of BTC's inclusion in the strategic reserve has sparked bullish sentiment, supported by increased open interest in call options. On-chain activity remains strong, reinforcing the positive outlook.

ETH: +0.7 — Ethereum's inclusion in the reserve has led to a significant price rally. Although technical indicators are mixed, the news-driven momentum suggests further upside potential.

SOL: +0.6 — Solana's price surge following the reserve announcement, combined with consistent on-chain activity, supports a positive allocation. The bullish sentiment is likely to persist in the short term.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. The absence of major developments suggests a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — As bullish sentiment drives capital into riskier assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL, there is a slight preference to reduce USDT holdings to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-03-03 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a proposed ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump, which included Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This announcement initially sparked a significant rally in these assets, although the gains have partially retraced. Despite this, the inclusion in the reserve plan has bolstered bullish sentiment, particularly for BTC, ETH, and SOL. However, recent market data shows a pullback in prices, with significant decreases in the last hour across all assets except USDT, which remains stable. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, suggests a mixed environment where risk appetite is present but tempered by broader market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price pullback, the inclusion in the strategic reserve and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook. However, the lack of consistent bullish momentum tempers the score.

ETH: +0.4 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the reserve inclusion and recent price action. However, the lack of additional bullish momentum signals and recent price decrease suggest a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's inclusion in the reserve plan supports a positive outlook, but the significant recent price drop and lack of momentum signal warrant a moderate score.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or momentum, DOGE remains neutral. Its recent price decrease suggests caution, but no strong signals for a directional change.

USDT: -0.3 — In light of the strategic reserve news and potential for increased risk appetite, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to potentially capitalize on opportunities in other assets."
2025-03-03 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This announcement has led to significant price rallies for these assets, although some of the initial gains have retraced. Technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and SOL show consistent buy signals, but momentum remains subdued across the board. DOGE and USDT have not been directly impacted by the news, with DOGE showing some price recovery and USDT maintaining its stability. Macroeconomic indicators such as a high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility suggest a mixed environment, which could lead to cautious capital rotation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The inclusion in the strategic reserve and a surge in call options indicate bullish sentiment, despite some retracement. The market cap and transaction activity also support a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the reserve news with a significant price increase. However, lower on-chain activity compared to BTC tempers the score slightly.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's inclusion in the reserve has led to a strong price rally. While technical indicators are positive, the lack of additional news keeps the score moderate.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, DOGE remains neutral. The recent price increase is not enough to warrant a stronger signal.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases due to positive news for other assets, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT."
2025-03-03 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The recent macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 22.78. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong at 106.75, which might exert downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The market data for the past four hours indicates mixed signals, with some assets experiencing slight increases and others showing significant decreases. Notably, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana experienced a price surge due to their inclusion in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" announced by former President Trump, although this rally has partially retraced. The technical indicators for most assets suggest a buy signal, but the momentum remains weak as the MACD is below the signal line across the board. With no significant news for DOGE and USDT, these assets remain relatively stable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, the inclusion in the strategic reserve and increased on-chain activity suggest potential upside. However, the retracement and lack of strong momentum temper enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.4 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the strategic reserve news. The price surge and buy signals are positive, but the weak momentum suggests a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's inclusion in the strategic reserve provides a bullish backdrop. The technical buy signals support a positive outlook, though momentum remains a concern.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, DOGE remains neutral. The lack of momentum and activity does not warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the strategic reserve news and the potential for increased risk appetite, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to allocate more capital to other assets with positive news and technical signals."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This announcement led to significant price surges across these assets, although the initial rallies have partially retraced. Despite the positive news, technical indicators remain mixed, with short-term momentum signals not fully supporting a strong bullish stance. The macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility, with a stable U.S. Dollar Index and high gold prices, suggesting a cautious risk environment. In this context, maintaining a balanced portfolio with a slight tilt towards growth-oriented assets seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The inclusion in the proposed crypto reserve and increased open interest in call options suggest renewed bullish sentiment, though recent price retracement warrants cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.4 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the strategic reserve news, but the lack of additional supportive technical signals suggests a moderate positive stance.

SOL: +0.4 — Solana's inclusion in the reserve initiative provides a bullish catalyst, but technical indicators remain mixed, justifying a moderate allocation increase.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance on DOGE seems appropriate.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment around major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential growth in other assets."
2025-03-03 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This announcement has sparked significant price rallies across these assets, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. However, the market remains volatile, with mixed technical signals and on-chain activity suggesting that while there is potential for further upside, caution is warranted. DOGE and USDT have not been influenced by significant news, and their market dynamics appear stable, with DOGE showing some increased activity but lacking strong directional catalysts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The inclusion in the proposed U.S. crypto reserve has sparked bullish sentiment, supported by increased on-chain activity and a strong buy trend signal. The positive news flow and technical indicators suggest a favorable environment for BTC.

ETH: +0.6 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from inclusion in the reserve plan, with a significant price surge and positive sentiment. Although technical indicators are mixed, the news provides a strong bullish backdrop.

SOL: +0.5 — SOL's inclusion in the reserve initiative has led to a price spike, and while technical indicators are not as strong as BTC, the news-driven rally supports a positive allocation score.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite some increased activity, DOGE lacks significant news or strong technical signals to justify a change in allocation. It remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of bullish sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-03-03 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by a significant announcement from former President Trump regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve."" This news has led to a notable price rally across these assets, although some of the initial gains have retraced. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index. Despite the positive news, technical indicators remain mixed, with short-term moving averages suggesting buying opportunities, but momentum signals like the MACD not yet confirming a bullish trend. The lack of significant news for DOGE and USDT suggests a more neutral stance for these assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The inclusion in the strategic reserve and increased open interest in call options suggest renewed bullish sentiment. However, the MACD remains below the signal line, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the strategic reserve news, but technical indicators are not fully supportive of a strong buy signal, hence a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's inclusion in the strategic reserve has driven a price rally, but like BTC and ETH, the technical indicators are not fully aligned with a strong upward trend.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. The lack of momentum and news keeps it in a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite due to the strategic reserve news, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL."
2025-03-03 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by the recent announcement of a U.S. crypto reserve plan that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This news has sparked significant price rallies in these assets, although the initial excitement has somewhat retraced. Despite the macroeconomic backdrop of high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, the crypto market is showing signs of bullish sentiment, particularly for assets included in the strategic reserve. However, technical indicators for most assets remain mixed, with many still lacking strong bullish momentum signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve plan and the surge in call options indicate strong bullish sentiment, although technical indicators are mixed. The overall market environment supports a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from its inclusion in the reserve plan, leading to a significant price increase. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — SOL's inclusion in the reserve plan has driven a notable price spike. Despite the lack of strong technical buy signals, the news supports a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. The lack of major developments suggests holding the current position.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment and capital rotation into riskier assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The market sentiment is currently bullish, driven by significant developments such as the announcement of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). This announcement has led to notable price surges in these assets, reflecting increased investor confidence and renewed bullish sentiment. Despite the macroeconomic context showing moderate volatility and stable interest rates, the crypto market is experiencing a positive shift, particularly for the assets mentioned in the reserve plan. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tether (USDT) have not seen significant news or price movements, indicating a more neutral stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The inclusion in the proposed crypto reserve and the surge in $100K call options indicate strong bullish sentiment. The technical indicators, such as the trend signal, also support a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's inclusion in the strategic reserve has led to a significant price increase. Although technical indicators are not strongly bullish, the news-driven sentiment justifies a positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's price has significantly increased due to its inclusion in the reserve plan. While technical indicators are neutral, the news impact supports a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral. The lack of movement suggests holding the current position without adjustment.

USDT: -0.4 — As the market sentiment shifts towards riskier assets due to the reserve announcement, there is a reduced need for stablecoin exposure, suggesting a slight reduction in USDT holdings."
2025-03-03 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently mixed, with recent significant price surges in BTC, ETH, and SOL driven by news of their inclusion in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. However, these gains have been partially retraced, indicating some uncertainty and volatility. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The recent sharp price decreases across most cryptocurrencies in the last hour suggest a potential short-term bearish sentiment, which may prompt a cautious approach in asset allocation. The absence of significant news for DOGE and USDT suggests these assets remain relatively stable and unaffected by recent developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, the inclusion in the strategic reserve and increased interest in call options suggest potential for upside. However, the recent price drop warrants cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the reserve supports a positive outlook, though recent price declines suggest a need for caution.

SOL: +0.2 — The strategic reserve news has positively impacted SOL, but the recent sharp price decrease tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or major changes in market data, DOGE remains neutral.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the recent volatility and price drops in other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-03-03 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This announcement has led to significant price spikes in these assets, although the initial rallies have somewhat retraced. The macroeconomic context remains mixed, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, which may support a gradual risk-on environment. However, technical indicators across most cryptocurrencies are not yet signaling strong buy signals, suggesting that the market is still in a phase of consolidation with potential for further upside if positive sentiment continues.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Recent inclusion in the strategic reserve proposal and increased open interest in call options suggest renewed bullish sentiment, despite mixed technicals.

ETH: +0.4 — Benefiting from the strategic reserve news, though technical indicators remain neutral. The price action suggests potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive news from the reserve announcement has driven a price spike, but technical indicators are still catching up. Maintain a cautious buy stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or technical signals to warrant a change in allocation. Maintain current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite due to positive news, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets."
2025-03-03 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, driven by significant news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement has led to a notable price rally across these assets, although some retracement has occurred. Despite the recent volatility, the macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with no major shifts in traditional market indicators. The lack of significant news for DOGE and USDT suggests a more neutral stance for these assets, with USDT continuing to serve as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The announcement of BTC's inclusion in the strategic reserve has bolstered bullish sentiment, supported by increased open interest in call options. Despite a recent retracement, the overall outlook remains positive.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the strategic reserve has led to a price surge. While technical indicators are neutral, the news-driven sentiment supports a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's price also spiked following the strategic reserve news. Although technical indicators remain neutral, the positive sentiment and price action justify a favorable allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical shifts, DOGE remains in a neutral position. The absence of new developments suggests maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to reduce USDT holdings in favor of riskier assets, though it remains a stable option for capital preservation."
2025-03-03 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" proposal that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This announcement led to a temporary surge in prices for these assets, although the gains have since retraced. Technical indicators across the board show a lack of strong buy signals, with most assets trading within normal ranges and below key moving averages. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, suggests a mixed environment where risk appetite may be tempered. In this setting, maintaining a balanced approach with some capital in stablecoins like USDT could be prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price retracement, the inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve proposal and increased call option activity suggest potential for future upside.

ETH: +0.3 — Similar to BTC, Ethereum's inclusion in the reserve proposal provides a positive outlook, although technical indicators remain neutral.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's mention in the reserve initiative supports a modestly bullish stance, but technicals do not yet confirm a strong buy.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, maintaining a neutral position on Dogecoin is appropriate.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the potential for increased risk appetite due to the reserve proposal, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently experiencing a bearish trend, as evidenced by significant price decreases across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE in the last hour. This downturn follows an initial surge driven by news of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that included BTC, ETH, and SOL, which temporarily boosted prices. However, the rally has since retraced, and technical indicators remain bearish with no buy signals. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, suggests a cautious approach, favoring stability over aggressive risk-taking.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the initial rally from strategic reserve news, BTC's significant price drop and lack of technical buy signals suggest reducing exposure to manage downside risk.

ETH: -0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH's price has fallen sharply after the initial news-driven surge, with technical indicators not supporting a bullish stance. A slight reduction is prudent.

SOL: -0.1 — SOL experienced a notable price decrease, and while it was part of the reserve news, the lack of technical support and recent volatility suggests a cautious reduction.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, maintaining current DOGE holdings is appropriate given the overall market uncertainty.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-03-03 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious with a bearish tilt, as evidenced by the significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE in the last few hours. This downturn is despite the recent positive news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve,"" which initially sparked price rallies. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, suggests a risk-averse environment. In such conditions, investors may prefer to hold or increase stablecoin positions like USDT to mitigate risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent price declines, the news of BTC's inclusion in a strategic reserve could provide a longer-term bullish foundation. However, current technical indicators are bearish, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the strategic reserve is a positive development, but recent price action and technical indicators suggest caution. A slight positive score reflects potential for recovery.

SOL: +0.1 — SOL's price has dropped significantly, but the strategic reserve news offers potential upside. The score reflects a cautious optimism given the broader market conditions.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. The lack of major developments suggests holding the current position.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish sentiment and recent price declines in other cryptocurrencies, maintaining or increasing USDT holdings is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-03-03 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This announcement initially sparked significant price rallies across these assets, although the gains have since retraced. Despite the short-term price fluctuations, the inclusion of these cryptocurrencies in a strategic reserve indicates a potential long-term bullish outlook. However, technical indicators across the board remain bearish, with most assets trading below their long-term moving averages and showing no immediate buy signals. In this context, maintaining a balanced approach with a slight tilt towards risk assets seems prudent, while keeping a significant portion in stablecoins to manage volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The news of BTC's inclusion in the strategic reserve suggests potential long-term bullishness, despite current bearish technical indicators. Maintaining a moderate positive allocation reflects this outlook.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the strategic reserve supports a positive long-term view. The recent price surge, although retraced, indicates underlying strength.

SOL: +0.4 — SOL's inclusion in the strategic reserve is a positive development, but its recent price volatility and lack of strong technical signals suggest a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, maintaining a neutral stance on DOGE is appropriate.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the potential for long-term bullishness in BTC, ETH, and SOL, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to allocate more capital towards these risk assets."
2025-03-03 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. Despite recent news of inclusion in a proposed U.S. crypto reserve, which initially sparked rallies for BTC, ETH, and SOL, these gains have largely retraced, indicating a lack of sustained bullish momentum. The macroeconomic context, characterized by a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets. As such, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT could be prudent in this environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent price declines, the news of BTC's inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve could provide some support. However, technical indicators remain bearish, warranting only a slight positive bias.

ETH: +0.1 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the reserve plan is a positive factor, but the lack of additional bullish signals from technicals suggests a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.1 — The initial positive reaction to the reserve news has faded, and technical indicators remain weak. A slight positive score reflects the potential for recovery if broader sentiment improves.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and continued bearish technicals, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the current bearish sentiment and technical weakness across other assets, a higher allocation to USDT is advisable to preserve capital and manage risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement has led to a temporary surge in prices for these assets, although the rally has since retraced. Despite the positive news, technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest a lack of strong bullish momentum, with all assets showing short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals below their lines. The macroeconomic context, including a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility, suggests a mixed environment where risk appetite is cautiously increasing but not yet robust.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The news of BTC's inclusion in the strategic reserve has sparked renewed interest, reflected in increased on-chain activity and a temporary price surge. However, technical indicators remain weak, suggesting a moderate rather than strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the reserve plan has positively impacted sentiment, leading to a price increase. While technical indicators are not yet bullish, the news provides a supportive backdrop for potential gains.

SOL: +0.5 — The strategic reserve news has also benefited SOL, resulting in a price spike. Despite weak technical signals, the positive sentiment warrants a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. The lack of strong drivers suggests holding the current position.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment around BTC, ETH, and SOL, there is a slight inclination to rotate capital out of USDT and into these assets, reflecting an increase in risk appetite."
2025-03-03 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement has led to a notable price surge across these assets, although the initial rally has somewhat retraced. Despite the positive news, technical indicators for most assets remain bearish, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals not yet turning bullish. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment, with moderate volatility and no extreme movements in traditional financial indicators. In this context, maintaining a balanced approach with a slight bias towards assets with positive news seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The announcement of BTC's inclusion in the strategic reserve has sparked renewed bullish sentiment, as evidenced by the surge in $100K call options. Despite technicals not fully aligning, the news provides a strong upside potential.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the reserve plan has led to a significant price jump. While technical indicators remain neutral to bearish, the news supports a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — SOL's price spike following the reserve announcement suggests increased investor interest. Although technicals are not yet supportive, the news-driven momentum justifies a positive allocation score.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. The lack of new developments suggests a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive news for BTC, ETH, and SOL, there is a slight shift in risk appetite away from stablecoins. Reducing USDT exposure slightly aligns with the potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets."
2025-03-04 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively high volatility environment, with the VIX at 23.51, indicating increased market uncertainty. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which typically puts pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Recent market data indicates a mixed sentiment across cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing significant price fluctuations, while Solana and Dogecoin show signs of potential breakdowns. Bitcoin has shown some recovery after a sharp drop, while Ethereum is testing key support levels. Solana faces selling pressure due to unstaking concerns, and Dogecoin is forming a bearish pattern. Tether remains stable, but regulatory concerns in Europe could impact its demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's recovery from a sharp drop and high on-chain activity suggest resilience. However, the lack of strong technical buy signals warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing significant sell pressure and is near key support levels. The risk of further downside due to ETF-related outflows and liquidation concerns suggests a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's significant price drop and concerns over unstaking create a bearish outlook. The potential for further declines necessitates reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin's breakdown below $0.20 and formation of a bearish wedge pattern indicate downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current sentiment.

USDT: +0.5 — In a volatile market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability. Regulatory concerns in Europe are noted, but the overall market uncertainty supports holding more stablecoins."
2025-03-04 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin experienced a sharp sell-off, dropping to $83k before rebounding slightly, while Ethereum is testing its $2,000 support level amidst ETF-related outflows. Solana faced a steep decline due to concerns over a large unstaking event, and Dogecoin broke below a key support level, forming a bearish wedge pattern. Meanwhile, Tether's stability is challenged by regulatory shifts in Europe, as Binance delists USDT for European users. Given the current macroeconomic context, with heightened volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, the market appears risk-averse, favoring stable assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a brief recovery, Bitcoin's recent volatility and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The macroeconomic environment and recent news indicate potential further downside risk.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is under pressure near its support level, with significant outflows and liquidation risks. The bearish sentiment and technical indicators warrant a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's sharp decline and concerns over large unstaking events indicate a bearish outlook. The potential for further downside to $100 suggests reducing holdings.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin's break below $0.20 and formation of a falling-wedge pattern point to further downside risk. The lack of positive catalysts supports a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current risk-averse environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure is prudent. Despite regulatory challenges in Europe, USDT remains a stable option amidst market volatility."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies over the past few hours. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop to $81.5k before rebounding slightly, indicating high volatility and potential recovery attempts. Ethereum is testing critical support levels around $2,000, with ETF-related outflows adding pressure. Solana faced a major crash due to strategic reserve announcements and concerns over large unstaking events. Dogecoin broke below $0.20, forming a bearish wedge pattern, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, leading to its delisting on Binance. In this environment, risk aversion seems prevalent, with stablecoins like USDT potentially offering a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight recovery, Bitcoin's recent volatility and lack of bullish signals suggest caution. The overall bearish sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty warrant a reduced exposure.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is under pressure from significant sell-offs and ETF-related outflows. Testing key support levels indicates potential downside risk, justifying a cautious stance.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's sharp decline and concerns over large unstaking events create a bearish outlook. The potential for further downside towards $100 suggests reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's break below $0.20 and forming of a bearish wedge pattern indicate downside risk. However, the lack of significant news beyond technical patterns suggests a moderate reduction.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent. The regulatory challenges in Europe are a concern but do not outweigh the need for stability amid market volatility."
2025-03-04 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. BTC experienced a sharp drop to around $83k before a slight recovery, while ETH is testing key support levels near $2,000 amid ETF-related outflows. SOL faced a substantial crash due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, and DOGE is under pressure from technical breakdown patterns. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, as evidenced by Binance's delisting announcement. Given the high volatility and bearish trends, a cautious approach with a focus on capital preservation is advisable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight recovery, BTC's technical indicators remain weak, and recent heavy selling suggests continued downside risk. Holding but cautious.

ETH: -0.2 — Testing key support levels with significant outflows and liquidation risks. Maintain exposure but be wary of further declines.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price crash and unstaking concerns create a bearish outlook. Reduce exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: -0.4 — Technical patterns indicate potential for further downside, and recent news undermines confidence. Reduce exposure.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, USDT provides stability and capital preservation, especially amid regulatory shifts in Europe. Increase exposure."
2025-03-04 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, as evidenced by significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop to $83k but showed resilience with a bounce back, indicating some underlying support. Ethereum is testing critical support levels around $2,000, with ETF-related outflows adding pressure. Solana faces significant selling pressure following FTX's unstaking event, raising concerns about further declines. Dogecoin has broken below key support levels, forming a bearish pattern. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, but regulatory actions in Europe, such as Binance delisting, could impact its usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a rebound, BTC's technical indicators remain bearish, and recent heavy selling suggests caution. Holding current exposure is prudent.

ETH: -0.4 — Testing support levels with ETF outflows and liquidation risks; reducing exposure slightly to mitigate potential downside.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price drop and unstaking concerns suggest further downside risk. Reducing exposure to manage potential losses.

DOGE: -0.3 — Breaking below $0.20 with a bearish wedge pattern indicates potential for further decline. Reducing exposure to limit risk.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides stability and liquidity, especially with regulatory shifts in Europe."
2025-03-04 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with recent price recoveries in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH following earlier sell-offs. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding from a significant dip, while Ethereum has avoided a major liquidation event, indicating some stability. However, Solana faces pressure from a substantial unstaking event, and Dogecoin is struggling with technical breakdowns. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, with high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar index, suggesting a mixed backdrop for risk assets. Regulatory developments, such as Binance's delisting of USDT in Europe, add to the complexity, potentially affecting stablecoin dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's recovery from a significant dip and its resilience in the face of heavy selling suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook. The macro environment remains challenging, but BTC's relative strength warrants a moderate positive allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's avoidance of a major liquidation and its ability to hold above key support levels indicate some stability. However, ETF-related outflows and macro pressures suggest a more cautious approach.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana faces significant selling pressure from a large unstaking event, raising concerns about further downside. The strategic reserve announcement provides some support, but risks remain elevated.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's technical breakdown and recent price drop below $0.20 suggest downside risks. However, the lack of significant negative news beyond technicals warrants only a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With regulatory developments affecting its use in Europe, USDT remains a neutral hold. The current macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility justify maintaining stablecoin exposure for risk management."
2025-03-04 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by volatility and mixed sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a sharp sell-off but showed resilience with a quick rebound, indicating potential support at lower levels. Ethereum is facing pressure near the $2,000 support level, with significant ETF-related outflows, but has avoided major liquidation events. Solana has seen a substantial decline due to strategic reserve announcements and concerns over large unstaking events, though some analysts expect support at $128. Dogecoin is under pressure after breaking below $0.20, with technical patterns suggesting further downside risk. Meanwhile, Tether is facing regulatory challenges in Europe, leading to its delisting on Binance, which could impact its stability and usage in the region.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests underlying support. However, caution is warranted due to mixed macroeconomic signals.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is testing a critical support level with mixed technical signals. The avoidance of major liquidation is positive, but ETF outflows remain a concern.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price decline and unstaking concerns weigh heavily on Solana, with potential for further downside. Current holdings should be cautiously managed.

DOGE: -0.4 — Breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish wedge pattern indicates potential for further declines. Reducing exposure is prudent given the technical outlook.

USDT: +0.4 — With market volatility and regulatory challenges, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity in uncertain conditions."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin experienced a volatile session, initially dropping but then rebounding, indicating some resilience despite heavy selling pressure. Ethereum is testing a critical support level at $2,000 amid ETF-related outflows, which suggests caution. Solana has faced significant downward pressure following a strategic reserve announcement and concerns over a large unstaking event, indicating potential for further declines. Dogecoin has broken below a key level, forming a bearish pattern, which could lead to further downside. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, as evidenced by Binance's delisting. Overall, the market is experiencing heightened volatility and uncertainty, with a cautious outlook prevailing.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests some underlying strength. However, the lack of bullish technical signals warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing significant pressure near the $2,000 support level, with no clear bullish signals. The risk of further downside due to ETF outflows suggests a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana is under significant selling pressure due to unstaking concerns and a recent price crash. The potential for further declines justifies reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.5 — Dogecoin's break below $0.20 and formation of a bearish pattern indicate a high risk of further declines. Reducing exposure is prudent given the negative technical outlook.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of market volatility and bearish signals across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."
2025-03-04 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with a slight bearish tilt due to recent volatility and macroeconomic pressures. Bitcoin experienced a significant drop but has shown resilience with a quick rebound, indicating potential support levels. Ethereum is under pressure, nearing its key support level of $2,000, with ETF-related outflows adding to the selling pressure. Solana faced a sharp decline due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, raising fears of further downside. Dogecoin is showing signs of a bearish pattern, breaking below $0.20, with potential downside risks. Tether remains stable, but regulatory challenges in Europe could impact its liquidity and usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's quick rebound suggests underlying support, making it relatively attractive in a mixed market environment.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing significant selling pressure and nearing a key support level, which warrants a cautious stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent sharp declines and unstaking concerns present downside risks, suggesting a cautious approach to Solana in the short term.

DOGE: -0.3 — Bearish technical patterns and recent price declines indicate potential further downside, warranting a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market volatility and mixed sentiment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."
2025-03-04 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with recent volatility and mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a notable dip to $83k, followed by a recovery, indicating potential resilience but also underlying selling pressure. Ethereum is testing critical support levels around $2,000, with ETF-related outflows adding to the uncertainty. Solana has faced significant downward pressure due to strategic reserve announcements and concerns over a large unstaking event, leading to fears of further declines. Dogecoin is under pressure as well, breaking below key levels and forming bearish patterns. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, though regulatory concerns in Europe could impact its usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests some resilience. However, the lack of strong bullish signals warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing critical support challenges and mixed news sentiment. The risk of further downside remains, but no immediate action is warranted.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price declines and unstaking concerns suggest potential for further downside. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current risks.

DOGE: -0.2 — Bearish patterns and recent price declines indicate potential for further losses. A slight reduction in exposure is advisable.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of market volatility and bearish sentiment in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility."
2025-03-04 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a quick recovery after a significant dip, indicating potential resilience despite recent volatility. Ethereum is testing key support levels, with recent ETF-related outflows adding pressure, but major liquidation risks have been avoided. Solana faces bearish pressure following a strategic reserve announcement and concerns over a large unstaking event, yet support is anticipated near $128. Dogecoin is under pressure after breaking below $0.20, with technical patterns suggesting further downside risk. Tether is stable, but regulatory challenges in Europe are noteworthy, affecting its usage on major exchanges like Binance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests underlying strength. However, the lack of strong buy signals and the macroeconomic environment warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing mixed signals with support at $2,000 being tested. The avoidance of major liquidation is positive, but ETF-related outflows maintain a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's recent price drop and concerns over large unstaking events suggest caution. The potential for support near $128 prevents a stronger sell signal.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's technical breakdown and recent news errors contribute to a bearish outlook. The potential for further downside risk justifies a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — With market volatility and regulatory challenges, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against potential downturns in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has shown resilience after a recent dip, rebounding from heavy selling pressure, though it remains below its recent highs. Ethereum is testing key support levels around $2,000, with recent volatility raising concerns about potential liquidations. Solana has experienced significant volatility, with a recent crash following strategic reserve announcements and concerns over large unstaking events. Dogecoin is facing bearish technical patterns, breaking below $0.20 and showing potential for further downside. Meanwhile, Tether's delisting by Binance in Europe highlights regulatory challenges, though its price remains stable as expected for a stablecoin. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with a preference for stability and risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound from lows suggests some resilience. However, caution is warranted due to macroeconomic uncertainties and recent heavy selling.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is at a critical support level with mixed technical signals. The risk of liquidation and ETF-related outflows suggests a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent volatility and concerns over large unstaking events create downside risk. Although some support is expected around $128, the current environment warrants caution.

DOGE: -0.5 — Bearish technical patterns and recent price declines suggest further downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market sentiment.

USDT: +0.4 — In a cautious market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, especially amid regulatory changes affecting stablecoins."
2025-03-04 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced significant volatility, with a recent dip followed by a recovery, indicating uncertain sentiment. Ethereum is testing critical support levels amid ETF-related outflows, though it avoided a major liquidation event. Solana has faced a sharp decline due to strategic reserve announcements and concerns over large unstaking events. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below key levels and forming a bearish pattern. Meanwhile, Tether is facing regulatory challenges in Europe, leading to its delisting on Binance. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious, with a tendency towards risk aversion, as evidenced by the volatility index and macroeconomic indicators.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's recovery from a significant dip suggests some resilience. However, the lack of strong technical buy signals warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing pressure from ETF-related outflows and is near key support levels. While it avoided a major liquidation, the mixed technical signals suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's sharp decline and concerns over large unstaking events create a bearish outlook. The potential for further downside warrants reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin's break below $0.20 and the formation of a bearish wedge pattern indicate downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent given the technical and sentiment challenges.

USDT: +0.5 — With market uncertainty and regulatory challenges for USDT in Europe, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against volatility."
2025-03-04 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop to $83k, though it showed some recovery, indicating potential volatility. Ethereum is facing pressure near the $2,000 support level, with significant liquidation risks narrowly avoided. Solana has seen a substantial crash following strategic reserve announcements and concerns over unstaking activities. Dogecoin has broken below key levels, forming a bearish pattern. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, as indicated by Binance's delisting.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some recovery, BTC's recent volatility and lack of strong technical buy signals suggest caution. The macroeconomic environment and recent sell-offs warrant a conservative approach.

ETH: -0.2 — Ethereum's proximity to key support levels and recent ETF-related outflows indicate potential downside risk. The market remains cautious despite avoiding major liquidation.

SOL: -0.5 — Significant price decline and concerns over large unstaking events suggest further downside risk. The strategic reserve announcement has not provided enough support.

DOGE: -0.4 — Breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish wedge pattern indicates potential further declines. Recent errors in reported figures add to negative sentiment.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent. Despite regulatory challenges, USDT provides a safe haven amid broader market volatility."
2025-03-04 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment reflects a mix of volatility and cautious optimism. Bitcoin has experienced significant price fluctuations, with a recent rebound suggesting some recovery momentum. Ethereum is facing pressure near the $2,000 support level, with ETF-related outflows adding to the uncertainty. Solana has undergone a sharp decline due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, though some analysts expect support around $128. Dogecoin has broken below key levels, forming a bearish pattern, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, impacting its stability in the region. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with potential for further volatility, especially in light of macroeconomic factors such as high volatility in traditional markets and a strong U.S. dollar.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's rebound and bullish momentum signal suggest a cautious buy opportunity, although macroeconomic factors warrant a conservative approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing pressure near a critical support level, with mixed signals from technical indicators and news, prompting a hold stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent sharp declines and unstaking concerns create downside risk, warranting a reduction in exposure to manage potential further losses.

DOGE: -0.2 — With a bearish pattern forming and price breaking below key levels, reducing exposure is prudent to mitigate downside risk.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and potential for further declines in other assets, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against risk."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some signs of recovery following recent sell-offs. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop but showed resilience by rebounding, indicating potential support levels. Ethereum is under pressure, testing key support levels due to ETF-related outflows, but has avoided major liquidation risks. Solana faced a significant decline due to strategic reserve actions and unstaking concerns, yet some analysts see potential support at lower levels. Dogecoin is experiencing downside pressure, forming a bearish wedge pattern. Tether's recent delisting in Europe by Binance could affect its stability in the region. Overall, the market shows cautious optimism with potential for further volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests underlying support. Bullish momentum and on-chain activity remain stable, warranting a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing significant pressure near support levels, with mixed signals from recent news and technical indicators. Holding current exposure seems prudent.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's recent sharp decline and unstaking concerns pose downside risks. While some support is expected, the current environment suggests caution.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's technical pattern indicates potential further downside, and recent news does not provide a strong bullish case. A slight reduction in exposure is advisable.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market conditions and recent volatility, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against potential downside risks in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with recent volatility and significant price fluctuations across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a sharp sell-off but showed resilience with a quick rebound, indicating potential recovery momentum. Ethereum is testing critical support levels amid ETF-related outflows, while Solana faces pressure from a significant unstaking event, raising concerns about further declines. Dogecoin has broken below key technical levels, indicating potential downside risks. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, affecting its stability as a preferred stablecoin.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound quickly suggests underlying strength. However, caution is warranted due to recent sell-offs.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum is under pressure from ETF-related outflows and is testing key support levels. The risk of further downside remains, but major liquidation risks have been avoided.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana faces significant selling pressure from unstaking events, with concerns about further declines. The strategic reserve announcement has not provided sufficient support.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's technical breakdown below $0.20 and the formation of a falling-wedge pattern suggest potential further downside, warranting a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of market volatility and regulatory challenges, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity, especially given the bearish sentiment in other assets."
2025-03-04 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of recovery after recent volatility. Bitcoin has rebounded from a significant dip, reflecting a broader market recovery, while Ethereum has avoided major liquidation risks despite testing key support levels. Solana's price has been volatile due to strategic reserve announcements and concerns over large unstaking events, but it has shown some resilience. Dogecoin has broken below a key psychological level, with technical patterns indicating potential further downside. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, leading to delistings on major exchanges like Binance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recovery from recent lows and bullish momentum signals suggest a favorable outlook, though caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent sell pressure and ETF-related outflows, Ethereum's resilience near support levels and avoidance of major liquidation risks provide a moderately positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's volatility and concerns over large unstaking events offset its recent price recovery, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — With Dogecoin breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish technical pattern, reducing exposure is prudent given the downside risks.

USDT: -0.4 — The delisting of USDT in Europe and a recovering risk appetite in the broader market suggest a rotation out of stablecoins."
2025-03-04 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic, with significant price recoveries observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE after recent sell-offs. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown strong rebounds, with Bitcoin recovering from a dip to $83k and Ethereum avoiding major liquidation risks. Solana, despite a recent crash and concerns over unstaking, has seen a notable price increase, indicating potential support levels. Dogecoin, while breaking below $0.20, is forming a wedge pattern that suggests possible downside risk. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, as Binance delists USDT, which may impact its stability and demand in that region.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong recovery from recent lows and bullish momentum signals suggest a favorable outlook. The rebound above $88k and positive on-chain activity support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.4 — Despite recent volatility and ETF-related outflows, Ethereum's price recovery and avoidance of major liquidation risks indicate potential for further gains, warranting a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's significant price increase and potential support near $128, despite recent unstaking concerns, suggest a cautiously optimistic stance, though risks remain.

DOGE: -0.1 — While Dogecoin has shown some recovery, the formation of a falling-wedge pattern and recent price drop below $0.20 suggest caution, justifying a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With regulatory challenges in Europe and a general market recovery favoring riskier assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-03-04 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant price recoveries observed across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, following earlier declines. Bitcoin's rebound above $88k and Ethereum's stabilization above $2,000 suggest a potential recovery phase, although recent volatility indicates underlying market fragility. Solana's price remains pressured by strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, while Dogecoin faces technical challenges with a potential downside risk. Tether's delisting by Binance in Europe introduces regulatory uncertainties but does not significantly impact its price stability. The macroeconomic context, with high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and bullish momentum, coupled with increased on-chain activity, suggest a favorable environment for further gains. The recent recovery from a sharp dip indicates resilience.

ETH: +0.6 — Ethereum's avoidance of major liquidation risks and its recovery above key support levels, alongside bullish momentum indicators, support a positive outlook despite recent volatility.

SOL: -0.3 — Despite a slight recovery, Solana faces significant selling pressure from unstaking concerns and strategic reserve volatility. The potential for further downside warrants caution.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's technical pattern suggests downside risk, and recent news highlights potential vulnerabilities. Maintain a cautious stance given the lack of strong positive catalysts.

USDT: +0.2 — While Tether remains stable, the regulatory environment in Europe introduces uncertainties. However, maintaining some exposure to USDT provides a hedge against market volatility."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a recent recovery in prices following significant sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience, bouncing back from sharp declines, although Ethereum faces potential liquidation risks. Solana has experienced volatility due to strategic reserve announcements and concerns over large unstaking events, while Dogecoin has broken below key support levels, indicating potential further downside. Tether's delisting in Europe by Binance reflects regulatory challenges but has not significantly impacted its stability. The macroeconomic environment, with a high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, suggests a mixed backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's recovery and strong on-chain activity suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook. The macro environment remains supportive of holding BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's resilience near key support levels and avoidance of major liquidation risks provide a moderate buy signal, though caution is warranted due to ETF-related outflows.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent volatility and concerns over large unstaking events create downside risk, warranting a slight reduction in exposure despite previous strategic reserve announcements.

DOGE: -0.4 — Breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish wedge pattern indicates potential further downside, suggesting a reduction in current holdings.

USDT: -0.2 — While maintaining stability, the delisting in Europe and improving risk sentiment in other assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-04 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing significant price increases over the past hours, supported by bullish momentum indicators. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience after recent sell-offs, rebounding strongly, although Ethereum faces pressure from ETF-related outflows. Solana's price has been volatile due to strategic reserve announcements and concerns over large unstaking events, but it has shown signs of recovery. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below key support levels with potential downside risks. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, but regulatory actions in Europe may impact its demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's rebound from recent lows and strong momentum signals suggest potential for further gains, but caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent sell pressure and ETF-related outflows, Ethereum's recovery and bullish momentum support a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's recovery from a sharp decline and strategic reserve inclusion provide some support, though concerns over unstaking remain.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's break below $0.20 and forming wedge pattern indicate downside risk, justifying a cautious stance given current holdings.

USDT: 0.0 — While regulatory actions in Europe could impact demand, USDT's stability and current market conditions suggest maintaining its current allocation."
2025-03-04 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing signs of recovery after recent volatility. Bitcoin has rebounded from a significant dip, and Ethereum has avoided major liquidation risks, suggesting some resilience. Solana, however, has faced a sharp decline due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, indicating potential instability. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below key levels with a bearish pattern forming, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe. The macroeconomic environment, with high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a mixed backdrop for risk assets, prompting a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin shows strong upward momentum and on-chain activity, suggesting a recovery. The rebound from the dip and positive sentiment in news support a moderately bullish stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's resilience in avoiding major liquidation and maintaining key support levels indicates a cautious buy. However, ETF-related outflows and recent corrections warrant a tempered approach.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline due to strategic reserve issues and unstaking concerns suggests potential downside risk. The market sentiment is currently bearish, justifying a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — With Dogecoin breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish wedge pattern, the outlook is negative. The news of overstated contract figures further dampens sentiment.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market volatility and mixed signals across other assets, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against potential downside risks. However, regulatory challenges in Europe warrant caution."
2025-03-04 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of volatility and recovery across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a sharp sell-off but has shown resilience with a quick rebound, indicating potential support at lower levels. Ethereum is facing pressure near the $2,000 support level, with significant ETF-related outflows, yet it has avoided major liquidation risks. Solana has seen a substantial drop due to strategic reserve announcements and concerns over large unstaking events, though some analysts see potential support at lower levels. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below key levels and forming a bearish pattern, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe with Binance delisting it for European users. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious with a focus on risk management amid potential downside risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's resilience and recovery from the dip suggest underlying strength. Positive momentum and on-chain activity support a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum faces mixed signals with pressure near support levels and significant outflows. The avoidance of major liquidation risks keeps the outlook neutral.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline and concerns over large unstaking events warrant caution. While some support is expected, the overall sentiment is bearish.

DOGE: -0.5 — Dogecoin's break below key levels and formation of a bearish pattern suggest downside risks. Current holdings should be reduced given the negative outlook.

USDT: +0.3 — With market volatility and regulatory challenges, maintaining a higher USDT exposure provides a hedge against potential downside risks in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum due to positive news about a potential national crypto reserve and tariff delay announcements. Ethereum, despite a recent pullback, maintains strong activity driven by its role in stablecoin issuance. Solana is stabilizing after a recent crash, supported by undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is experiencing a speculative boost from ETF optimism and technical bullish signals. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with regulatory clarifications ensuring its continued use in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding a national crypto reserve strategy are likely to drive further demand and price appreciation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price weakness, Ethereum's strong usage in stablecoin issuance provides underlying support, though caution is warranted due to potential pullback fears.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential for further gains, supported by strong network growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical signals and ETF speculation provide a moderate bullish outlook, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2025-03-05 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has benefited from geopolitical news, including potential U.S. government interest in crypto reserves and tariff delays, driving its price upwards. Ethereum, although facing some bearish sentiment due to recent price drops, remains supported by strong stablecoin activity. Solana has shown resilience, rebounding after a significant decline, and is noted for its undervalued DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is experiencing a bullish technical setup and ETF optimism, which has lifted its price. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with regulatory clarifications ensuring its continued use in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news regarding potential U.S. crypto reserves and tariff delays have bolstered Bitcoin's outlook, coupled with strong technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price pressure, Ethereum's strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support, suggesting a cautious buy.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent rebound and undervaluation in the DeFi space compared to Ethereum make it an attractive buy, supported by positive technical signals.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish technical patterns and ETF optimism provide a moderate buy signal, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other cryptocurrencies, there is a strategic shift away from stablecoins like USDT."
2025-03-05 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing signs of bullish momentum. Bitcoin is experiencing a strong upward trend, bolstered by news of potential U.S. government interest in a national crypto reserve, which has significantly lifted market sentiment. Ethereum, despite recent price pullbacks, remains supported by its stablecoin dominance, although it faces potential downside risks. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, with reports suggesting its DeFi ecosystem is undervalued compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish signals, while Tether remains stable amid regulatory clarifications in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news regarding potential U.S. government interest in Bitcoin, suggesting increased demand and upward momentum.

ETH: +0.1 — While there is some bearish sentiment due to price pullbacks, Ethereum's strong stablecoin activity provides a supportive base, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential for further gains, supported by strong network growth and technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical setups and ETF optimism provide a moderate buy signal, though the overall market position remains speculative.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT."
2025-03-05 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum due to potential U.S. government interest in a national crypto reserve and a temporary boost from tariff-related news. Ethereum faces some bearish pressure as it approaches key support levels, but its strong stablecoin activity provides a buffer. Solana is recovering from a recent crash, supported by undervalued DeFi tokens and strong network growth. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish setups, suggesting potential for a rebound. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarifications ensuring its continued use in Europe despite some exchange delistings.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news on potential U.S. crypto reserve and strong technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making BTC an attractive allocation.

ETH: +0.1 — While facing some downward pressure, Ethereum's strong stablecoin activity provides support, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation of DeFi tokens relative to Ethereum suggest potential for further gains, supporting a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — ETF optimism and bullish technical patterns indicate potential for a rebound, justifying a slight increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-05 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recovery and undervaluation relative to Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem indicate potential for further gains, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — ETF optimism and bullish technical setups provide a positive outlook for Dogecoin, though its volatility suggests a more cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment across other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum due to positive news about a potential national crypto reserve and tariff delays, which have boosted market sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing some pullback fears but remains supported by its stablecoin-driven usage. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, with reports highlighting its undervaluation compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish signals, while Tether remains stable with regulatory clarifications supporting its use in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news regarding a potential national crypto reserve strategy. This positions BTC as a leading asset in the current market environment.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent pullback fears, Ethereum's strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and reports of undervaluation relative to Ethereum suggest potential for further gains, making it an attractive asset to increase exposure to.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical indicators and ETF optimism provide a supportive backdrop for Dogecoin, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing signs of bullish sentiment, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-03-05 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

   Activity on Ethereum remains strong due to its dominance in stablecoin issuance, giving ETH support despite broader market weakness.

**Solana (SOL)**

- *SOL rebounds ~7% to ~$144 after recent crash*
   Solana recovered nearly 7% in a single day following a ~15% slide, indicating a possible stabilizing trend after the sharp drop.
- *Solana DeFi tokens undervalued versus Ethereum equivalents*
   A Franklin Templeton report notes Solana’s DeFi ecosystem trades at lower valuation multiples than Ethereum’s—even as SOL shows strong network growth.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- *DOGE climbs ~4% to US $0.20 amid ETF optimism*

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to positive news about potential U.S. crypto reserve strategies and tariff delays, which have boosted its price. Ethereum is experiencing some weakness, with fears of a further pullback, although its strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support. Solana has shown a significant rebound after a recent crash, suggesting potential stabilization and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin is benefiting from ETF optimism and technical bullish signals, while Tether remains stable amid regulatory clarifications in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by positive news and technical indicators. The potential for a national crypto reserve strategy adds to the upside potential.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent weakness, Ethereum's strong role in stablecoin issuance provides a supportive backdrop. However, caution is warranted due to potential pullback fears.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent price rebound and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential for further gains. Positive technical signals support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — ETF optimism and technical bullish setups provide a positive outlook. However, the speculative nature of DOGE warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin exposure is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-05 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by positive developments in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has seen a significant boost due to news of a potential U.S. national crypto reserve and the postponement of tariffs, which has lifted market sentiment. Dogecoin is also benefiting from ETF optimism and technical bullish signals. Ethereum, while supported by stablecoin activity, faces downward pressure with concerns of breaching key support levels. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, supported by undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable with regulatory clarity from ESMA, but there is a general shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding a national crypto reserve strategy are boosting demand, making BTC highly attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite pullback fears, Ethereum's strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support, though caution is warranted due to potential downside risks.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space present a buying opportunity, supported by strong network growth.

DOGE: +0.6 — Positive technical indicators and ETF optimism suggest potential for further gains, making DOGE an attractive allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely."
2025-03-05 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with positive developments in Bitcoin and Dogecoin driving a bullish outlook. Bitcoin's potential inclusion in a national crypto reserve and the delay in U.S. tariffs have bolstered its price, while Dogecoin is benefiting from ETF speculation and technical bullish signals. Ethereum, however, faces potential downside risk despite strong stablecoin-driven activity, indicating mixed sentiment. Solana shows signs of recovery after a recent crash, supported by undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, but elevated volatility suggests potential for sudden market shifts.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news about potential national crypto reserve plans provide a robust bullish outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong stablecoin activity, concerns about a potential pullback to $2,000 and mixed market sentiment warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum suggest potential for further upside.

DOGE: +0.6 — Positive technical setups and ETF optimism provide a favorable environment for potential gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive signals in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, with positive momentum across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Bitcoin's price is buoyed by news of potential U.S. national crypto reserve plans and a delay in tariffs, which has lifted market sentiment. Ethereum, despite a recent pullback, remains supported by strong stablecoin activity. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, and its DeFi ecosystem is noted to be undervalued compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is gaining on ETF optimism and technical bullish setups. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high volatility and a stable U.S. dollar, suggests a cautious yet optimistic environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news about a potential U.S. crypto reserve strategy are driving demand. The bullish sentiment is further supported by technical indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Although facing some pullback fears, Ethereum's strong stablecoin-driven activity provides underlying support. The technicals remain bullish, albeit with caution.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is rebounding from a recent crash, with positive momentum and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem suggesting further upside potential.

DOGE: +0.4 — Dogecoin benefits from ETF optimism and a bullish technical setup, indicating potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite in the market, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into more volatile assets."
2025-03-05 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic news and strong technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge, fueled by speculation around a potential U.S. crypto reserve strategy and a delay in U.S. auto tariffs, pushing its price above $90,000. Ethereum, while showing strong on-chain activity due to stablecoin issuance, faces some bearish sentiment with fears of a pullback. Solana has rebounded from a recent crash, supported by reports highlighting its undervaluation compared to Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin is benefiting from ETF optimism and technical bullish setups, indicating potential for further gains. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with regulatory clarity in Europe, though the market's risk-on sentiment suggests a shift away from stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding potential U.S. crypto reserve strategy support a bullish outlook for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite recent bearish sentiment, strong stablecoin-driven activity provides underlying support, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: +0.6 — Recent rebound and undervaluation in the DeFi space compared to Ethereum suggest potential for further growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical indicators and ETF speculation create a favorable environment for Dogecoin, though with moderate confidence.

USDT: -0.5 — With the market's bullish sentiment, there's a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2025-03-05 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bullish, driven by positive developments in Bitcoin and a general upward trend across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant boost due to news of a potential U.S. national crypto reserve and a delay in auto tariffs, which has improved market sentiment. Ethereum is facing some pullback fears, but its strong stablecoin-driven activity provides underlying support. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, with undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem noted as a potential growth area. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish signals, while Tether remains stable amid regulatory clarifications in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding a potential U.S. crypto reserve strategy are boosting demand, making BTC highly attractive.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent pullback fears, Ethereum's strong stablecoin activity supports its usage, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana is recovering from a recent crash, with strong network growth and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem providing a positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from potential ETF approval and technical bullish signals suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a slight preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2025-03-05 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic developments and specific asset news. Bitcoin has seen a significant surge due to geopolitical news, including a potential U.S. crypto reserve strategy and tariff delays, pushing its price above $90,000. Ethereum, despite a recent pullback, maintains strong usage due to its stablecoin dominance, which provides some support. Solana shows signs of recovery after a recent crash, with reports suggesting its DeFi tokens are undervalued compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish signals. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with regulatory clarifications supporting its continued use.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive geopolitical news and robust on-chain activity, makes it a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong usage from stablecoins, Ethereum's recent price pullback and mixed news sentiment suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space, along with positive technical indicators, warrant a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical setups and ETF optimism provide a mild bullish outlook, though its speculative nature warrants caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-05 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by positive developments in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has experienced a notable surge, buoyed by news of potential U.S. government interest in establishing a national crypto reserve and the postponement of tariffs, which has lifted market sentiment. Ethereum, however, faces bearish pressure with concerns of a potential drop below $2,000, despite strong stablecoin activity supporting its network. Solana has shown signs of recovery after a recent crash, with reports suggesting its DeFi tokens are undervalued compared to Ethereum's. Dogecoin is experiencing positive momentum due to ETF optimism and technical indicators suggesting a potential rebound. The macroeconomic context, with stable oil prices and a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets, with volatility remaining a concern.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by positive news and significant on-chain activity. The potential for a national crypto reserve adds to its appeal.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bearish price pressure but strong network activity due to stablecoin issuance. Caution is warranted given potential downside risks.

SOL: +0.3 — Recent recovery and undervaluation of DeFi tokens present a moderate buying opportunity, though caution is advised due to recent volatility.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from ETF optimism and technical bullish signals suggest potential for further gains, making it relatively attractive.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment shows a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bitcoin has experienced a significant boost due to positive news from the U.S. regarding potential crypto reserves and tariff delays, pushing its price above $90,000. Ethereum, while facing some pullback fears, remains supported by strong stablecoin activity. Solana has shown resilience, recovering from a recent crash, and is noted for its undervalued DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin has seen a positive reaction to ETF optimism and technical bullish signals. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory news confirming its continued usability in Europe despite Binance's delisting in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by positive macroeconomic news and on-chain activity. The potential for a national crypto reserve adds a significant bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price declines, Ethereum's strong stablecoin-driven activity provides underlying support, though caution is warranted due to pullback fears.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential upside, supported by strong network growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical signals and ETF optimism provide a bullish outlook, though the asset remains speculative.

USDT: 0.0 — Stablecoin remains a safe haven, but current market conditions suggest a neutral stance as risk appetite slightly increases."
2025-03-05 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news regarding potential U.S. crypto reserve strategies and tariff delays. This has lifted Bitcoin above $90,000, signaling bullish sentiment. Ethereum, however, is experiencing some weakness due to fears of a pullback, although its strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support. Solana is stabilizing after a recent crash, with signs of undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish signals, suggesting potential for a rebound. USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarifications supporting its continued use despite some market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and bullish news sentiment, particularly regarding potential U.S. crypto reserve strategies, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price weakness, strong stablecoin activity provides support. The potential for a pullback is a concern, but the overall sentiment remains slightly positive.

SOL: +0.3 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum suggest potential for further gains, despite recent volatility.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive technical signals and ETF optimism indicate potential for a rebound, making it relatively attractive in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins like USDT."
2025-03-05 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive macroeconomic news and potential government interest in crypto reserves. Ethereum faces a mixed outlook, with strong stablecoin activity supporting it despite recent price weakness and fears of further declines. Solana is rebounding from a recent crash, supported by undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is experiencing a technical rebound, bolstered by ETF optimism. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarity from ESMA providing reassurance despite Binance's delisting in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding potential government crypto reserves are boosting demand and sentiment, making BTC a preferred asset for allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong on-chain activity, ETH is facing downward pressure and uncertainty, leading to a neutral stance as it balances between support from stablecoin activity and fears of a price breach below $2,000.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent price recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential for further gains, making it an attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical indicators and ETF speculation provide a mild bullish outlook, warranting a modest increase in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-05 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a bullish tilt, driven by positive developments in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has experienced a significant boost due to potential U.S. government interest in a national crypto reserve, alongside a temporary tariff delay, which has lifted the broader crypto market. Dogecoin is also seeing positive sentiment with speculation around a potential ETF approval. However, Ethereum faces some bearish pressure due to recent price declines and concerns about further pullbacks, despite strong stablecoin-driven network activity. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, supported by undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with no immediate threats to the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news regarding potential U.S. crypto reserves and tariff delays. On-chain activity remains robust, suggesting continued interest.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with strong network activity but recent price weakness and pullback fears. Holding position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in DeFi space present an opportunity for growth. However, technical indicators are not fully supportive yet.

2025-03-05 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

**Solana (SOL)**

- *SOL rebounds ~7% to ~$144 after recent crash*
   Solana recovered nearly 7% in a single day following a ~15% slide, indicating a possible stabilizing trend after the sharp drop.
- *Solana DeFi tokens undervalued versus Ethereum equivalents*

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with positive developments in Bitcoin and Dogecoin driving some bullish momentum. Bitcoin has seen a significant boost due to potential government interest in establishing a crypto reserve and a delay in U.S. auto tariffs, which has lifted market sentiment. Dogecoin is benefiting from ETF optimism and technical bullish setups. Ethereum, however, is facing downward pressure due to fears of a pullback, despite strong stablecoin-related activity. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, with reports highlighting its undervaluation compared to Ethereum. The macroeconomic backdrop, with stable interest rates and a strong S&P 500, suggests a moderate risk-on environment, but high volatility (VIX) indicates potential caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong upward momentum, supported by positive news about potential government interest and tariff delays, suggests a favorable environment for further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong stablecoin activity, Ethereum faces potential downside risk from recent price weakness and mixed technical signals, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana's recovery and undervaluation compared to Ethereum, along with a recent price rebound, make it a moderately attractive option for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from ETF speculation and technical bullish signals provide a supportive backdrop for Dogecoin, making it an appealing choice for increased exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With a generally optimistic market sentiment and a preference for risk assets, reducing stablecoin holdings like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with notable bullish developments in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge, driven by positive news regarding a potential U.S. national crypto reserve and the postponement of auto tariffs, which has bolstered market confidence. Dogecoin is also seeing a positive trend, supported by technical bullish setups and speculation around a potential ETF approval. Meanwhile, Ethereum is facing downward pressure due to pullback fears, despite strong stablecoin-driven activity. Solana shows signs of recovery after a recent crash, but its technical indicators remain weak. USDT remains stable, with no significant regulatory constraints impacting its use.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding a potential national crypto reserve strategy are boosting Bitcoin's attractiveness, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong on-chain activity, Ethereum faces bearish sentiment due to recent price declines and pullback fears, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, and its undervaluation compared to Ethereum presents a moderate opportunity for capital allocation.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive technical signals and ETF optimism are driving Dogecoin's upward momentum, making it an attractive option for increased exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With the overall market sentiment leaning towards risk-on, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-03-05 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by positive developments in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has seen a significant price surge due to potential U.S. government interest in establishing a national crypto reserve, alongside positive macroeconomic news such as the delay in auto tariffs. Dogecoin is also experiencing upward momentum due to speculation about a potential ETF approval and technical bullish signals. Ethereum, while supported by strong stablecoin activity, faces bearish pressures with concerns of further price declines. Solana is showing signs of stabilization after a recent crash, with reports suggesting undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarity from ESMA supporting its use in Europe despite Binance's delisting in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding potential government interest in Bitcoin support a bullish outlook.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong on-chain activity, the bearish sentiment and recent price decline suggest a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Signs of stabilization and undervaluation in the DeFi space provide a modestly positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and ETF optimism contribute to a bullish sentiment.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, reducing exposure to stablecoins is advisable."
2025-03-05 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to positive news regarding potential U.S. crypto reserve strategies and tariff delays, which have propelled BTC above $90,000. Ethereum, while experiencing a recent pullback, remains supported by its stablecoin activity, indicating resilience despite broader market concerns. Solana has shown signs of recovery after a recent crash, and its DeFi ecosystem is gaining attention for its undervaluation compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish patterns, suggesting potential for further gains. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarifications ensuring its continued use in the European market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive macroeconomic news and increased on-chain activity. Bitcoin's role in a potential U.S. crypto reserve adds to its attractiveness.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent pullback fears, Ethereum's strong stablecoin-driven activity provides underlying support, making it a moderate buy in the current environment.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted given previous volatility.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and ETF optimism provide a bullish outlook, making it attractive for short-term gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in the broader crypto market, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely."
2025-03-05 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news regarding potential U.S. government support for a national crypto reserve. This has lifted Bitcoin's price above $90,000, contributing to a broader positive sentiment in the crypto market. Ethereum, while facing some pullback fears, remains supported by strong activity in stablecoin issuance. Solana has shown signs of recovery after a recent crash, and its DeFi ecosystem is gaining attention for its undervaluation compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is experiencing a bullish setup with speculation around a potential ETF, while Tether remains stable amidst regulatory clarifications in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong momentum and positive news about potential U.S. crypto reserve support make BTC highly attractive. On-chain activity is robust, supporting further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent pullback fears, Ethereum's strong stablecoin-driven activity provides a solid base. However, caution is warranted due to potential downside risks.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential upside. Positive technical signals support a moderate increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Bullish technical patterns and ETF speculation provide some upside potential, but the overall market impact remains limited.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-06 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by significant news, such as the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a surge in price ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum, while facing some technical delays with its Pectra upgrade, still maintains a bullish outlook with potential resistance near $2,245. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with debates on staking rewards and a price range that suggests potential volatility. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether's recent freezing of assets on a sanctioned exchange may cause some concern about its stability. The macroeconomic context, with high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar index, suggests a cautious approach, favoring assets with strong momentum and news support.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin is supported by strong upward momentum, positive news regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and increased trading volume. These factors suggest a favorable environment for BTC, despite the broader economic volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, Ethereum shows bullish technical signals and a potential upward correction. However, resistance at $2,245 tempers enthusiasm slightly.

SOL: +0.2 — Solana's price is within a volatile range, with potential for both support and resistance testing. The ongoing debate on staking rewards adds uncertainty, but the overall market sentiment remains slightly positive.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in market data, Dogecoin remains neutral. The slight decrease in price does not warrant a change in allocation without further developments.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive momentum in other cryptocurrencies and the recent freezing of USDT on a sanctioned exchange, there is a moderate preference to reduce exposure to USDT in favor of riskier assets with higher potential returns."
2025-03-06 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to significant developments such as the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the U.S. government and a surge in price ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum is experiencing a bullish correction, though technical resistance remains a concern. Solana shows mixed signals with discussions around staking rewards and a potential test of support or resistance levels. Dogecoin has seen a price increase but lacks significant news to drive further momentum. Tether's recent freezing of assets on a sanctioned Russian exchange highlights regulatory risks but does not significantly impact its stablecoin status. The macroeconomic backdrop is relatively stable, with no extreme volatility in traditional markets, which supports a moderate risk-on environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by significant news and technical indicators. The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve adds a bullish long-term narrative.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, ETH shows bullish momentum and a potential for upward correction, though resistance remains a concern.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed signals with ongoing debates about staking rewards, but recent price increases and technical indicators suggest potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, the lack of significant news or developments keeps the outlook neutral.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent in the current environment."
2025-03-06 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, there is a moderate preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2025-03-06 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has shown strong upward momentum, driven by significant news such as the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a price surge ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum is facing mixed signals due to technical resistance and delays in its network upgrade. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with debates over staking rewards and potential price fluctuations within a defined range. Dogecoin lacks significant news but shows bullish momentum in technical indicators. Meanwhile, Tether's recent freezing of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks but doesn't seem to impact its stability as a reserve asset. The macroeconomic environment remains stable, with no extreme volatility, suggesting a balanced risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news developments, such as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, support increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical resistance and upgrade delays, bullish momentum and a recent price increase justify a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed market outlook and ongoing debates about staking rewards suggest cautious optimism, with potential for price movement within a defined range.

DOGE: +0.1 — Although lacking significant news, DOGE's technical indicators show bullish momentum, warranting a slight positive bias.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has surged past $92K, driven by optimism surrounding a White House summit and the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Ethereum is experiencing a bullish correction, although technical resistance remains a challenge. Solana is seeing debates on staking rewards, which could impact its investment appeal, while Dogecoin has shown a significant price increase without any major news. Meanwhile, Tether has been involved in regulatory actions, freezing assets on a sanctioned Russian exchange, which may affect its perception as a stable and reliable asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and upcoming White House summit support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, bullish price action and technical analysis suggest potential for further gains, although resistance remains.

SOL: +0.5 — Positive price action and ongoing discussions about staking rewards indicate potential for growth, with room to test higher resistance levels.

DOGE: +0.2 — Significant price increase and bullish momentum, although lacking major news, suggests some potential for continued gains.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation away from stablecoins like USDT is likely."
2025-03-06 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has surged above $92K, driven by optimism surrounding a U.S. executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a forthcoming White House summit. Ethereum, despite a delay in its Pectra upgrade, shows bullish technical signals, although it faces resistance around $2,245. Solana is experiencing mixed sentiment with debates on staking rewards, but it remains within a strong price range. Dogecoin has shown significant price increases, although no major news has influenced its movement. Tether's recent freeze of USDT on a Russian exchange highlights regulatory actions but doesn't significantly impact its stablecoin status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve are driving prices higher, making BTC an attractive asset to increase exposure.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, ETH maintains bullish momentum and technical indicators suggest potential for further gains, albeit with some resistance.

SOL: +0.3 — While debates on staking rewards create some uncertainty, SOL's price stability within the $115–$155 range and positive technical signals support a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: +0.2 — Significant price increases and bullish momentum suggest some potential for gains, though the lack of major news keeps the signal moderate.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in the crypto market."
2025-03-06 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to significant developments such as the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the U.S. government and a notable price surge above $92K. This has been accompanied by increased trading volume, suggesting a bullish outlook for BTC. Ethereum, while showing bullish technical signals, faces uncertainty due to the delayed Pectra upgrade, which could introduce downside risks if resistance levels are not breached. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with ongoing debates about staking rewards and a price range that suggests potential volatility. Dogecoin lacks significant news, but its recent price movements indicate some speculative interest. Tether's stability is underscored by its involvement in regulatory actions, highlighting its role as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and strategic reserve news provide a bullish outlook, making it a priority for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical bullish signals, the delay in the Pectra upgrade introduces some caution, though overall sentiment remains positive.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed market signals and ongoing debates about staking rewards suggest a cautious but slightly positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed price movements suggest a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable."
2025-03-06 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge as it surges past $92K, fueled by positive news regarding a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and anticipation of a White House summit. Ethereum, while showing bullish potential, faces technical resistance and delays in its Pectra upgrade, which tempers enthusiasm.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding strategic reserves and upcoming summits suggest continued bullish potential.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical resistance and upgrade delays, the overall bullish sentiment and potential for a breakout warrant a modest positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and recent price volatility suggest maintaining a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by significant news, such as the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the U.S. government and a surge in price ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum, while facing some technical challenges with the Pectra upgrade delay, still maintains a bullish outlook with potential resistance around $2,245. Solana is experiencing mixed sentiment due to debates over staking rewards, but its price remains within a potential breakout range. Dogecoin lacks significant news but shows consistent bullish technical signals. Tether's recent freezing of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges but does not significantly impact its stability as a reserve asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and significant positive news developments, suggesting continued upward momentum and increased institutional interest.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, Ethereum maintains a bullish technical outlook, with potential for price appreciation if resistance levels are breached.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive technical indicators and a recent price increase suggest potential for further gains, although debates over staking rewards introduce some uncertainty.

DOGE: +0.2 — Consistent bullish technical signals and recent price increases support a modest positive outlook, despite the absence of significant news.

USDT: -0.5 — In a market environment with increasing risk appetite, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2025-03-06 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum and positive news regarding its strategic reserve status, which could bolster its appeal as a reserve asset. Ethereum, while facing technical delays with its Pectra upgrade, remains in a bullish correction phase but is struggling against resistance levels. Solana's price outlook is mixed, with debates on staking rewards impacting sentiment, but it remains within a significant trading range. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's involvement in freezing assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks but doesn't significantly impact its stablecoin status. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a balanced approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and strategic reserve news support a bullish outlook. The macro context and on-chain activity further reinforce confidence in BTC's potential for gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, ETH's technical indicators remain bullish. However, resistance levels warrant a cautious approach, justifying a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.2 — While debates on staking rewards create some uncertainty, SOL's technical indicators and trading range suggest potential for gains, albeit with some caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, DOGE remains neutral, lacking clear directional catalysts.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2025-03-06 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by significant news such as the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the U.S. government and a price surge above $92K. Ethereum, however, faces mixed sentiment due to technical delays in its Pectra upgrade, although it maintains a bullish outlook if it can overcome resistance levels. Solana is experiencing mixed signals, with debates over staking rewards and a price range that suggests potential volatility. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a stable outlook, while Tether's recent freeze of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks but does not significantly impact its stablecoin status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and significant positive news, such as the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite technical delays, Ethereum maintains a bullish outlook with potential for upward movement if resistance is broken, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive price movements and ongoing debates about staking rewards indicate potential for growth, though mixed signals suggest a cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment leans towards risk-on with Bitcoin's strong performance, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is expected, reducing its attractiveness in the portfolio."
2025-03-06 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by strategic reserve news and anticipation of a crypto summit. Ethereum, while facing technical challenges with its Pectra upgrade, maintains a bullish outlook with resistance levels in focus. Solana's market activity suggests potential volatility as stakeholders debate changes to staking rewards, though it remains within a defined price range. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a stable position. Tether's recent freezing of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks, but its stable price reflects its role as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and strong price momentum suggest increased capital allocation to BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical upgrade delays, ETH shows bullish momentum and potential for upward movement, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.5 — Continued bullish momentum and price activity within a favorable range support a positive allocation, despite potential staking reward changes.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or changes in market data suggests maintaining current exposure without adjustment.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is advisable to capitalize on growth opportunities elsewhere."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows mixed signals, with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility as indicated by the VIX. This suggests a cautious market sentiment. Bitcoin has shown resilience, driven by positive news regarding a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a price surge above $92K, indicating strong institutional interest. Ethereum faces technical challenges with the delayed Pectra upgrade, which could weigh on sentiment despite a bullish price forecast. Solana's internal debates on staking rewards and mixed price outlook suggest uncertainty. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's freezing of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks, potentially affecting its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news and price action, along with institutional interest, support a strong buy signal. The strategic reserve announcement adds a bullish narrative.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical challenges with the Pectra upgrade, the bullish forecast and current price resilience suggest moderate upside potential.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed signals from internal debates and price outlook, but the potential for testing higher resistance levels provides a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a hold position, with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment in BTC and moderate interest in ETH and SOL, capital rotation out of stablecoins is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-03-06 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by significant developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price has surged past $92K, buoyed by the U.S. administration's creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and anticipation of a White House summit on digital assets. Ethereum, despite a delay in its Pectra upgrade due to testnet issues, shows bullish potential but faces technical resistance. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with discussions around staking rewards potentially impacting investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether's recent freeze of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory challenges. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high volatility and stable gold prices, suggests a mixed risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the upcoming summit provide strong bullish sentiment, supported by recent price surges and increased trading volume.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's technical indicators suggest a potential bullish correction, warranting a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: +0.2 — While the price outlook is mixed, the ongoing discussions about staking rewards and recent price recovery suggest a cautious but positive sentiment.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in other assets and the regulatory challenges highlighted by recent freezes, a rotation out of USDT into more volatile assets is advisable."
2025-03-06 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable surge above $92K, driven by positive news regarding a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and anticipation of a White House summit. Ethereum faces mixed signals, with a bullish technical forecast tempered by delays in its Pectra upgrade. Solana's market outlook is uncertain, as stakeholders debate changes to staking rewards, which could impact smaller validators. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether's recent freeze of assets on a sanctioned Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a balanced risk environment, though the high gold price indicates some underlying caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by strategic reserve news and upcoming summit, coupled with positive technical signals, suggests continued bullishness.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical resistance and upgrade delays, Ethereum shows bullish potential with increased transaction activity, warranting a modest positive outlook.

SOL: +0.1 — While facing mixed market trends and potential changes in staking rewards, Solana's technical indicators and market cap stability suggest a cautious positive stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical shifts, Dogecoin remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in other cryptocurrencies and the strategic reserve news, there is a preference for rotating capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."
2025-03-06 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge, driven by significant news about the U.S. establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a surge in price ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum is facing technical challenges with its Pectra upgrade delay, which could weigh on sentiment despite a recent price uptick. Solana is experiencing mixed signals, with debates on staking rewards and a potential test of key price levels. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's recent action of freezing assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks but does not significantly impact its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a price surge above $92K suggest strong bullish sentiment and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite technical challenges with the Pectra upgrade, the price is showing signs of recovery, though resistance remains a concern.

SOL: +0.3 — While there is debate over staking rewards, the price is trending positively with potential to test higher resistance levels, indicating moderate bullish potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral stance with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and capital rotation towards more volatile assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted."

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience and a potential upward trajectory due to positive news about the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a significant price surge ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum, however, faces mixed sentiment with technical challenges delaying its Pectra upgrade, although there is a bullish outlook if it can overcome resistance. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with debates on staking rewards and a potential test of support or resistance levels. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's recent freeze of USDT on a sanctioned Russian exchange highlights regulatory risks but does not significantly impact its stability as a safe haven in volatile markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong news support from the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and recent price surge indicate potential for further gains, making BTC attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a bullish forecast, the delay in the Pectra upgrade and resistance challenges suggest a hold position until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — While facing mixed sentiment, the potential for testing higher resistance levels and ongoing discussions on staking rewards present moderate upside potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or major changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains a hold.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment in BTC and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing USDT exposure is reasonable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-06 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with recent volatility and macroeconomic uncertainties influencing crypto markets. Bitcoin has shown some resilience, buoyed by news of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a surge in price ahead of a White House summit. However, technical indicators suggest caution, as BTC's price is below key moving averages. Ethereum faces technical resistance and delays in its Pectra upgrade, adding to market hesitancy. Solana's market outlook remains uncertain amidst debates on staking rewards, while Dogecoin lacks significant news to drive momentum. Tether's recent freeze of USDT on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory pressures on stablecoins. Given these dynamics, a cautious approach with a slight preference for risk assets over stablecoins seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive news regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and upcoming summit supports BTC, but technical indicators suggest caution, warranting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a bullish forecast, technical resistance and upgrade delays create uncertainty, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite mixed sentiment, SOL's potential to test higher support levels and ongoing debates on staking rewards suggest a moderate buy opportunity.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and technical signals results in a neutral position for DOGE.

USDT: -0.4 — With some positive sentiment in risk assets, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-03-06 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a relatively high 10-Year Treasury Yield and elevated volatility as indicated by the VIX, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. In the crypto space, Bitcoin has shown a significant price surge due to optimism surrounding a U.S. executive order and an upcoming White House summit, indicating strong institutional interest. Ethereum faces technical challenges with its Pectra upgrade delay, which may dampen investor confidence despite a potential bullish correction. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with debates over staking rewards and price movements within a defined range. Dogecoin lacks significant news, while Tether's involvement in freezing assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and strategic reserve developments are driving positive sentiment and price momentum, making BTC a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite technical upgrade delays, there is potential for a bullish correction. However, the mixed sentiment warrants a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.3 — Although facing debates over staking rewards, SOL's price is within a stable range, and potential support at lower levels suggests moderate attractiveness.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, DOGE remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment in BTC and potential bullish moves in other assets, there is a strategic shift away from stablecoins to capitalize on growth opportunities."
2025-03-06 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable surge above $92K, driven by increased trading volume and positive news regarding a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, technical indicators for most cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH, remain bearish, with short-term moving averages below longer-term ones and MACD signals below their lines. Ethereum faces challenges with its delayed Pectra upgrade, adding to the uncertainty. Solana's mixed outlook and ongoing debates about staking rewards reflect a market in flux, while Dogecoin lacks significant news to influence its trajectory. Tether's recent freeze of assets on a sanctioned exchange underscores regulatory risks but does not significantly impact its stablecoin status. In light of these factors, a cautious approach with a slight preference for risk assets is warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite bearish technicals, the positive news around the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and recent price surge above $92K suggest potential for further gains.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with technical resistance and delayed upgrades balance out any bullish sentiment, warranting a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — While technical indicators are not strongly bullish, the potential for testing support/resistance within the $115–$155 range and ongoing protocol discussions provide a moderate positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news or technical momentum keeps Dogecoin in a neutral position.

USDT: -0.3 — With some positive sentiment in risk assets like BTC, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential upward movements in the market."
2025-03-06 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of strength due to the U.S. administration's strategic reserve announcement and an upcoming White House summit. This has led to a recent price surge, although it remains below the recent high of $92K. Ethereum faces technical challenges with the delayed Pectra upgrade, which has created uncertainty despite a potential bullish correction. Solana's community is debating economic adjustments to staking, which could impact its attractiveness to investors. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, while Tether's recent freeze of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive news regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and upcoming summit support a bullish outlook, although technical indicators remain neutral.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with a delayed upgrade and resistance levels create uncertainty, balancing potential bullish corrections with downside risks.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite low on-chain activity, the debate on staking rewards could enhance long-term investment appeal, though immediate impact is limited.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price action suggest a neutral stance as it continues to trade within a normal range.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive developments in BTC and potential bullish sentiment, there is an opportunity to rotate some capital out of stablecoins into more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by significant developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has seen a notable surge in price, fueled by the U.S. government's strategic reserve announcement and anticipation of a crypto summit, suggesting a bullish outlook. Ethereum, however, faces mixed signals due to a delay in its Pectra upgrade, which introduces uncertainty despite a potential bullish technical setup. Solana's outlook is mixed, with discussions around staking rewards and a wide trading range, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news. Tether's recent freezing of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory challenges but does not significantly impact its stability as a reserve asset.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strategic reserve announcement and upcoming summit provide strong bullish sentiment, alongside recent price increases and heightened on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, the potential for a bullish breakout and recent price resilience warrant a modest positive score.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals from staking reward discussions and a broad trading range suggest a neutral position until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment in BTC and ETH, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-03-06 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of a potential rally driven by strategic government initiatives and upcoming summits. Despite this, technical indicators across most assets remain bearish, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals not yet bullish. Ethereum faces technical resistance and delays in its network upgrade, which could dampen investor enthusiasm. Solana's internal debates on staking rewards reflect a strategic shift that could affect its market dynamics, while Dogecoin remains quiet with no significant news. Tether's actions against a sanctioned exchange highlight regulatory influences on stablecoins, which could impact their perceived safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and upcoming summit suggest strong institutional interest and potential upward momentum, despite current technical signals.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed technical outlook with resistance at $2,245 and delayed network upgrades suggest a cautious approach, balancing potential upside with downside risks.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite bearish technicals, the debate on staking rewards indicates proactive community engagement, which may support long-term value.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest holding the current position without adjustments.

USDT: -0.5 — With Bitcoin showing potential for gains and other assets stabilizing, reducing USDT exposure aligns with a moderate increase in risk appetite."
2025-03-06 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of strength due to the U.S. government's strategic reserve announcement and a price surge ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum faces mixed signals, with a delayed upgrade and technical resistance, while Solana's community is debating staking reward adjustments, which could impact its attractiveness. Dogecoin remains relatively quiet without significant news, while Tether's involvement in freezing assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by stable interest rates and a moderate VIX, suggests a cautious risk-on sentiment, with potential for capital rotation into more volatile assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strategic reserve announcement and price surge above $92K indicate strong institutional interest and potential for further gains, making BTC a preferred allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, the bullish forecast and potential for a technical breakout provide a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.1 — The debate on staking rewards introduces some uncertainty, but the potential for testing higher resistance levels supports a slightly positive stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment in BTC and ETH, reducing stablecoin exposure in favor of these assets aligns with a moderate risk-on strategy."
2025-03-07 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. This downturn is exacerbated by macroeconomic factors such as high volatility (VIX at 23.37) and a strong U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 103.84), which typically lead to risk-off behavior among investors. The recent announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has not provided the expected bullish momentum for BTC, as traders are hedging with put options, indicating a lack of confidence in immediate price recovery. Additionally, the exclusion of other cryptocurrencies like SOL and DOGE from the reserve plan has further dampened sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve announcement, the lack of immediate buying and increased put options suggest continued downside risk. Current holdings should be cautiously reduced.

ETH: -0.1 — Similar to BTC, ETH is experiencing bearish sentiment with increased put buying. However, whale accumulation provides some support, warranting a slight reduction.

SOL: -0.4 — The negative reaction to the reserve plan and public objections from its co-founder have led to significant price drops. Current holdings should be reduced further.

DOGE: -0.5 — The exclusion from the reserve plan and legal uncertainties are weighing heavily on DOGE, justifying a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent to preserve capital and mitigate risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context presents a mixed picture, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, which could indicate cautious market sentiment. The recent announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has led to increased hedging activity in BTC and ETH, as traders seek downside protection. This has also caused a ripple effect across other assets, with SOL and DOGE experiencing declines due to their exclusion from the reserve plan. Despite the bearish sentiment, there is notable whale accumulation in ETH, suggesting potential long-term bullishness. Meanwhile, USDT remains a safe haven amidst market uncertainty, though recent actions by Tether to freeze assets on a Russian exchange highlight regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve news, the lack of immediate buying and increased hedging indicates caution. The recent price volatility suggests a need to reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: 0.0 — While there is whale accumulation, the overall market sentiment remains cautious with increased put buying. Holding current positions seems prudent.

SOL: -0.2 — The negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and public pushback by its co-founder suggests a need to slightly reduce exposure.

DOGE: -0.1 — The disappointment from the reserve plan and legal uncertainties contribute to a slightly bearish outlook, warranting a small reduction in holdings.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the current market uncertainty and increased hedging activity, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable for stability and liquidity."
2025-03-07 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with significant volatility observed across major cryptocurrencies. The recent announcement of Bitcoin being recognized as a strategic reserve asset by the U.S. has introduced uncertainty, leading to increased hedging activity with put options in BTC and ETH. This has contributed to a bearish sentiment, despite some accumulation by large holders in ETH. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced declines due to their exclusion from the primary reserve strategy, while Tether's recent freeze of assets linked to a Russian exchange has added to the uncertainty in the stablecoin space. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by high volatility and mixed signals from traditional markets, further complicates the outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve news, the lack of immediate purchasing and increased hedging activity suggests caution. The market is still digesting the implications, and technical indicators remain bearish.

ETH: +0.2 — While technicals are weak, the significant whale accumulation amidst low social sentiment offers a contrarian bullish signal. This suggests potential for upside if sentiment shifts.

SOL: -0.1 — The exclusion from the primary reserve and public objections from its co-founder have dampened sentiment. However, the on-chain activity surge provides a slight counterbalance.

DOGE: -0.2 — The lack of inclusion in the reserve plan and ongoing legal issues contribute to a negative outlook. The absence of positive catalysts keeps sentiment low.

USDT: +0.4 — In a volatile market environment, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure is prudent. The recent asset freeze is a concern but does not outweigh the need for stability in current conditions."
2025-03-07 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with significant volatility and a general downward trend in prices across major cryptocurrencies. The recent U.S. announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve has not sparked a bullish rally, as traders are hedging with put options, indicating concerns about further downside risks. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing similar bearish sentiment, with traders seeking downside protection and negative reactions to the U.S. reserve strategy. Dogecoin has also been negatively impacted by the reserve plan, as it was not included. Meanwhile, Tether's recent action to freeze assets on a Russian exchange has added to the uncertainty, although USDT remains a stable option amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve announcement, the lack of immediate bullish momentum and increased hedging suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: -0.2 — While whale accumulation is a positive sign, the overall bearish sentiment and hedging activity warrant a cautious stance. Slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.4 — Negative sentiment from the reserve announcement and public objections from the SOL co-founder suggest potential further downside. Reduce exposure.

DOGE: -0.5 — The lack of inclusion in the reserve plan and ongoing legal issues contribute to a bearish outlook. Reduce exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of market volatility and bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity."
2025-03-07 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The recent U.S. government announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve has created a mixed reaction in the crypto markets. While Bitcoin is recognized as a reserve asset, the lack of immediate purchases has led to increased hedging activity with put options. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing similar hedging behavior, with Solana facing additional pressure from its exclusion from the primary reserve plan. Dogecoin has seen a decline due to disappointment over its exclusion from the reserve strategy. Tether's recent action to freeze assets on a Russian exchange has not significantly impacted its stability, but it highlights ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.3** — Despite the hedging activity, the recognition of Bitcoin as a reserve asset by the U.S. government provides a long-term bullish signal. However, caution is warranted due to the lack of immediate buying.

**ETH: +0.1** — Whale accumulation suggests underlying bullish sentiment, but the increase in put options indicates caution. The score reflects a slight preference for holding due to potential accumulation benefits.

**SOL: -0.1** — The negative sentiment from its exclusion from the primary reserve plan and public objections by its co-founder suggest potential downside risks. However, high on-chain activity provides some support.

**DOGE: -0.2** — Disappointment from the reserve plan and legal challenges create a bearish outlook. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is warranted to manage risk.

**USDT: +0.4** — In light of the uncertain market conditions and increased hedging across other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent to manage portfolio volatility."
2025-03-07 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment reflects a cautious stance among investors, primarily driven by macroeconomic uncertainties and recent geopolitical developments. The U.S. government's formal recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset has sparked interest but also led to increased hedging activities, as seen in the rise of short-dated put options for BTC and ETH. This indicates a mixed sentiment, where traders are wary of potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have been negatively impacted by the reserve strategy, with Solana facing internal dissent and Dogecoin experiencing disappointment from its exclusion. Meanwhile, Tether's recent action against a Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges in the stablecoin sector.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish signals, the strategic reserve news provides a long-term supportive backdrop. However, the market's hedging behavior suggests caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation amidst low social sentiment indicates potential upside, but the overall market remains cautious, as reflected in the increased put options.

SOL: -0.1 — While SOL has seen a price increase, the negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and internal disagreements tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent disappointment from the reserve plan and lack of significant positive news warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of increased market volatility and cautious sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against potential downside risks in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a slight bearish tilt, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties and recent developments around the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. The announcement of Bitcoin's inclusion in a government reserve has led to increased hedging activities, with traders seeking downside protection through put options in BTC, ETH, and SOL. This indicates a lack of confidence in sustained upward momentum across these assets. Meanwhile, Solana and Dogecoin have been negatively impacted by their exclusion from the primary reserve strategy, leading to a decline in investor confidence. Tether's recent action to freeze assets on a Russian exchange has not significantly affected its stability, but it underscores ongoing geopolitical risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve announcement, the lack of new purchases and increased hedging signal caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

ETH: -0.1 — While whale accumulation is a positive sign, the overall sentiment remains mixed with increased hedging activity. A slight reduction is prudent given current market conditions.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent price increases, the negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and lack of technical buy signals suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — The disappointment from the reserve plan and lack of positive catalysts warrant a slight reduction in exposure to manage downside risk.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the cautious market sentiment and increased hedging activity, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for potential opportunities."
2025-03-07 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The recent announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has created a mixed sentiment across the crypto market. While Bitcoin's recognition as a reserve asset is a significant milestone, the lack of immediate buying support has led traders to hedge with put options. Ethereum and Solana have also seen increased demand for downside protection, reflecting cautious sentiment. Despite some negative news for Dogecoin and Tether's operational challenges, the overall market sentiment is cautious, with a slight preference for stability and risk management.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — The strategic reserve announcement is a long-term positive, but short-term hedging indicates caution. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.1 — Whale accumulation suggests underlying strength despite low social sentiment. Slightly increase exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent price volatility and negative news impact. Hold current position.

DOGE: -0.2 — Negative sentiment from exclusion in the reserve plan and legal issues suggest reducing exposure slightly.

USDT: +0.4 — Increased demand for stability amid market uncertainty and hedging activity. Increase exposure to manage risk."
2025-03-07 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by a VIX of 23.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is strong, which may exert downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Recent news highlights a significant development with the U.S. formalizing Bitcoin as part of its strategic reserves, which has led to increased hedging activity in BTC and ETH. Solana and Dogecoin have experienced negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the reserve plan, while Tether faces operational challenges due to regulatory actions. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with traders seeking downside protection and stablecoins maintaining a strong position.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — The inclusion of Bitcoin in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a long-term bullish signal, despite current hedging activity. This development may increase institutional interest and support BTC's value.

**ETH: +0.3** — Despite increased put option activity, whale accumulation and low social sentiment suggest a contrarian buy opportunity. The technicals are not strongly bullish, but the accumulation indicates potential upside.

**SOL: -0.1** — Negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and public objections by its co-founder weigh on SOL. However, the asset shows some bullish momentum in recent technical indicators, warranting a cautious hold.

**DOGE: -0.3** — DOGE has been negatively impacted by the reserve plan, and there is no significant positive catalyst in the news or data. The asset may face further downside pressure, justifying a reduction in exposure.

**USDT: +0.2** — Given the cautious market sentiment and ongoing geopolitical tensions, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent for capital preservation. The recent freeze of USDT on a Russian exchange does not significantly impact its overall stability."
2025-03-07 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a slight bearish undertone, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as high volatility and a strong U.S. Dollar Index. The announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has created a mixed reaction, with traders seeking downside protection across major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. This has led to increased demand for short-dated put options, reflecting uncertainty. Solana and Dogecoin have faced negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the primary reserve strategy, while Tether's recent freeze of funds on a Russian exchange adds to the cautious sentiment surrounding stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: -0.3** — Despite the strategic reserve announcement, the lack of immediate buying support and increased hedging activity suggests caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

**ETH: +0.1** — While downside protection is being sought, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound. Maintain a slightly positive stance due to accumulation trends.

**SOL: 0.0** — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but negative sentiment from reserve exclusion. Hold current position as the market digests news.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Limited impact from recent news and low on-chain activity. Maintain a neutral position as there are no strong drivers for change.

**USDT: +0.3** — Given the overall cautious market environment and increased volatility, maintaining a higher USDT position is prudent for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 23.37. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which can exert downward pressure on crypto assets. Recent developments highlight a significant move by the U.S. government to recognize Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, which has led to increased hedging activities in BTC and ETH through short-dated puts. This has created a cautious sentiment among traders, despite some bullish accumulation in ETH. Solana faced negative sentiment due to its exclusion from the primary reserve, while DOGE experienced a drop following the reserve announcement. Tether's recent action to freeze assets on a Russian exchange adds a layer of geopolitical risk to the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — The strategic reserve news provides a long-term bullish signal, but the immediate market reaction is cautious with increased hedging. Maintain a moderate positive stance due to potential future support.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite short-term hedging, whale accumulation suggests underlying bullish sentiment. The technicals show bullish momentum, warranting a slight positive allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed news with negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and co-founder objections. However, strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum provide a counterbalance, suggesting a hold position.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent negative news and lack of inclusion in the reserve plan have dampened sentiment. Given current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent to manage risk.

USDT: +0.1 — With increased market uncertainty and geopolitical risks affecting stablecoins, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation as a hedge against volatility is advisable."
2025-03-07 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with no significant changes in key indicators such as the U.S. Dollar Index, gold, and the S&P 500. However, the CBOE Volatility Index suggests heightened market uncertainty. Recent developments, including the U.S. government's formalization of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, have caused mixed reactions across the crypto market. While Bitcoin is recognized as a reserve asset, this has led to increased hedging activity with put options, indicating caution among investors. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing similar hedging behavior, although Ethereum shows signs of bullish whale accumulation. Solana and Dogecoin have faced negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the reserve plan, while Tether has been impacted by regulatory actions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the hedging activity, Bitcoin's recognition as a reserve asset is a long-term positive. The market is cautious, but the overall sentiment is supportive of BTC's strategic importance.

ETH: +0.3 — Bullish whale accumulation and contrarian signals from low social sentiment suggest potential upside, despite short-term hedging activity.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent negative sentiment due to reserve exclusion, but strong on-chain activity and bullish momentum provide a counterbalance.

DOGE: -0.2 — Negative sentiment from exclusion in the reserve plan and legal issues weigh on DOGE, though it shows some bullish momentum.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and strategic moves towards other assets, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."
2025-03-07 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The market is experiencing a mix of cautious optimism and strategic repositioning following the U.S. government's decision to include Bitcoin in its strategic reserves. This move has led to increased hedging activity across BTC, ETH, and SOL, as traders seek downside protection through put options. Despite the initial excitement, the lack of immediate new purchases has tempered bullish sentiment. Ethereum is seeing whale accumulation, suggesting confidence among large holders despite a dip in social sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin faced negative reactions due to their exclusion from the primary reserve plan, with SOL experiencing additional pressure from internal disagreements. Meanwhile, Tether's freezing of funds on a Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite hedging activity, the strategic reserve news provides a long-term bullish backdrop. On-chain activity remains stable, supporting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and bullish momentum suggest potential upside, although hedging activity indicates caution. The overall outlook is slightly positive.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but negative sentiment from reserve exclusion and internal discord. Hold position as the market digests news.

DOGE: -0.3 — Negative sentiment following reserve exclusion and legal issues. Reduce exposure slightly, given current holdings.

USDT: -0.2 — With a cautious market and some capital rotation into riskier assets, maintain a slightly reduced exposure to stablecoins."
2025-03-07 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a cautious undertone. The recent U.S. decision to include Bitcoin in its strategic reserves has created a stir, leading to increased hedging activity with put options for BTC and ETH. This indicates a degree of uncertainty and a defensive posture among traders. Solana and Dogecoin have faced negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the reserve strategy, while Tether's recent freeze of funds on a Russian exchange adds a layer of geopolitical risk. Despite these developments, there is some bullish momentum in the technical indicators for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, suggesting potential upward movement if macro conditions stabilize.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the hedging activity, BTC's inclusion in the U.S. strategic reserve is a long-term bullish signal. Technical indicators show bullish momentum, supporting a moderate increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While traders are hedging, whale accumulation and bullish momentum suggest potential upside. The sentiment dip might offer a contrarian buying opportunity.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite negative news, SOL shows strong technical indicators and transaction activity. The recent price increase and bullish momentum support a cautious positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE's exclusion from the reserve plan and mixed news create uncertainty. Despite bullish technicals, the lack of strong positive catalysts warrants a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With potential bullish moves in other assets, reducing USDT exposure slightly could capitalize on risk-on sentiment. However, maintaining a stable reserve is prudent given market uncertainties."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a notable increase in bullish momentum across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. The recent announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has created a mixed reaction, with traders hedging against potential downside risks through put options. However, this move has also led to increased interest and accumulation in these assets, particularly ETH, where whale activity has surged. SOL has experienced some volatility due to its exclusion from the primary reserve, but it maintains strong technical indicators. DOGE and USDT are seeing less favorable conditions, with DOGE facing disappointment from the reserve announcement and USDT dealing with regulatory actions affecting its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the hedging activity, BTC's inclusion in the U.S. reserve and strong on-chain activity support a positive outlook. The strategic reserve announcement could bolster long-term confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and bullish momentum suggest a favorable environment, although the market is hedging against potential downside risks.

SOL: +0.6 — Strong technical indicators and significant on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum, despite recent news-related volatility.

DOGE: -0.1 — Disappointment from the reserve announcement and lack of significant positive developments warrant a cautious stance, though current holdings prevent a stronger sell signal.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and regulatory challenges, a slight reduction in USDT exposure is prudent to capitalize on opportunities in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX at 23.37. The recent announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has introduced a new dynamic to the market, with traders seeking downside protection in BTC and ETH through put options. This has created a mixed sentiment, with some investors hedging against potential declines despite the bullish momentum seen in technical indicators. Solana and Dogecoin have faced negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the reserve plan, while Tether's recent freeze of USDT on a Russian exchange has added to the uncertainty surrounding stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the hedging activity, BTC maintains strong technical indicators with bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity. The strategic reserve announcement adds a long-term bullish narrative.

ETH: +0.3 — While there is hedging activity, the bullish momentum and whale accumulation suggest potential upside. The sentiment dip could be a contrarian buy signal.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with positive technical momentum but negative sentiment due to reserve exclusion. The market seems undecided, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — Negative sentiment following the reserve plan exclusion and legal uncertainties. Current holdings justify a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With bullish signals in other assets and a risk-on environment, reducing stablecoin exposure slightly can free up capital for potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-07 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently mixed, with significant macroeconomic developments influencing crypto assets. The U.S. government's formal recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset has created a complex environment. While this move is a positive long-term signal for Bitcoin, the lack of immediate purchases has led investors to hedge with put options, indicating short-term caution. Ethereum and Solana also saw increased put option activity, reflecting broader market uncertainty. Solana's exclusion from primary reserve status and the subsequent pushback from its co-founder have added to the volatility. Dogecoin has been negatively impacted by its exclusion from the reserve plan, while Tether's recent freeze of assets on a Russian exchange has added to the stablecoin's cautious outlook.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve news, short-term hedging indicates caution. However, the long-term recognition as a reserve asset is supportive.

ETH: +0.1 — Whale accumulation suggests underlying strength, but short-term hedging and social sentiment dips warrant caution.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent volatility due to reserve exclusion and co-founder objections create uncertainty, balancing out the positive technical indicators.

DOGE: -0.2 — Negative sentiment from reserve exclusion and legal issues weigh on the asset, despite no major technical shifts.

USDT: +0.5 — Increased volatility and hedging in other assets suggest a preference for maintaining liquidity and stability through USDT."
2025-03-07 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a mixed environment with relatively high volatility (VIX at 23.37) and stable gold prices, indicating some risk aversion in traditional markets. The recent announcement of the U.S. formalizing a strategic Bitcoin reserve has created a significant ripple effect across the crypto market. While this move has been seen as a positive long-term signal for Bitcoin, the lack of immediate purchasing has led to increased hedging activities with puts, indicating caution among traders. Ethereum and Solana have seen similar hedging behavior, with Ethereum experiencing a notable increase in whale accumulation despite low social sentiment. Solana's market sentiment was negatively impacted by its exclusion from the primary reserve, and Dogecoin faced disappointment due to its non-inclusion in the reserve strategy. Tether's recent freeze of funds on a Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The strategic reserve announcement is a long-term positive, but current hedging activity suggests caution. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite hedging, the accumulation by whales indicates underlying confidence. Slightly increase exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with negative sentiment from reserve exclusion balanced by strong on-chain activity. Hold current position.

DOGE: -0.2 — Disappointment from reserve exclusion and lack of positive catalysts suggest reducing exposure slightly.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market uncertainty and increased hedging, a higher allocation to stablecoins is prudent for risk management."
2025-03-07 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic context indicates a mixed environment with relatively high volatility (VIX at 23.37) and stable interest rates (DGS10 at 4.32%). The recent announcement of Bitcoin being included in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has created a significant buzz, although it has led to increased hedging activity as traders seek downside protection. Ethereum and Solana have seen similar hedging behavior, with Solana facing additional pressure due to its exclusion from the primary reserve. Dogecoin and other altcoins have been negatively impacted by the reserve plan, while Tether's recent action to freeze assets on a Russian exchange has raised concerns about its operational stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the hedging activity, the strategic reserve news provides a long-term bullish signal. The technicals show strong buy signals, although caution is warranted given the recent volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and bullish momentum suggest potential upside, but the market's hedging behavior indicates caution. The overall sentiment is mixed, but the technicals remain supportive.

SOL: +0.1 — Recent price recovery and bullish technicals are positive, but the exclusion from the primary reserve and co-founder objections introduce uncertainty. The asset remains attractive but with caution.

DOGE: -0.2 — The lack of inclusion in the reserve plan and legal issues create a bearish sentiment. While technicals are still positive, the news has dampened enthusiasm.

USDT: 0.0 — With the current market volatility and mixed signals, maintaining a neutral position in USDT is prudent. The recent freeze on a Russian exchange raises concerns, but its stable nature provides a safe haven amidst uncertainty."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with a moderate level of volatility (VIX at 23.37) and a strong S&P 500 index, suggesting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. The recent U.S. decision to include Bitcoin in a strategic reserve has created a mixed reaction, with traders seeking downside protection through put options, indicating some uncertainty. Ethereum and Solana also saw increased put option activity, reflecting similar caution. Despite these protective measures, there is notable whale accumulation in Ethereum, suggesting underlying bullish sentiment. Solana faced negative sentiment due to its exclusion from the primary reserve, while Dogecoin suffered from disappointment over its non-inclusion. Tether's action against a Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve news, the market's cautious response with put options suggests some uncertainty. However, the overall macro context and technical indicators remain supportive.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation indicates potential bullish sentiment despite increased put option activity. The technical indicators remain positive, supporting a modest allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — The negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion is balanced by strong technical indicators and recent price increases, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — Disappointment over non-inclusion in the reserve plan and lack of significant positive news warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed sentiment and protective measures in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a hedge against potential downside risks."
2025-03-07 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a mixed environment with relatively high volatility (VIX at 23.37) and a strong U.S. dollar index (DXY at 103.84), suggesting cautious market sentiment. The recent announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has created a stir, with BTC being recognized as a government reserve asset, leading to increased hedging activity. This has also affected sentiment across other cryptocurrencies, with traders seeking downside protection in ETH and SOL. DOGE and other altcoins experienced disappointment due to their exclusion from the reserve plan. Meanwhile, Tether's freezing of $27 million USDT on a Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory and geopolitical risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The strategic reserve announcement is a significant long-term positive, but current hedging activity suggests caution. Maintain moderate exposure to capitalize on potential upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent hedging, whale accumulation indicates underlying bullish sentiment. Maintain a moderate positive stance given the potential for recovery.

SOL: +0.1 — Recent price volatility and negative sentiment from reserve exclusion warrant caution, but technical indicators remain positive. Slightly increase exposure.

DOGE: -0.1 — Disappointment from reserve exclusion and lack of significant positive catalysts suggest a cautious stance. Slightly reduce exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — Maintain current holdings as a hedge against market volatility. No strong signals to increase or decrease exposure significantly."
2025-03-07 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a mixed environment with relatively high volatility (VIX at 23.37) and a stable U.S. dollar index (DXY at 103.84). The recent announcement of Bitcoin being included in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has created a significant market reaction, with traders seeking downside protection through put options, reflecting a cautious sentiment. Ethereum and Solana have also seen increased put option activity, indicating concerns about potential downside risks. Solana and Dogecoin have been negatively impacted by the exclusion from the primary reserve strategy, while Tether's recent freeze of $27 million USDT on a Russian exchange has added to the uncertainty in the stablecoin market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve news, the market's cautious sentiment and increased put option activity suggest a moderate buy signal, supported by recent price increases and on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.2 — Although there is increased downside protection activity, the bullish accumulation by whales and the contrarian signal from low social sentiment provide a slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — The negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and public objections by the co-founder are counterbalanced by strong technical signals, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.1 — Currently held in the portfolio, DOGE's price drop and lack of inclusion in the reserve strategy suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — With increased market volatility and uncertainty, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against potential downside risks in other assets."
2025-03-07 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic context suggests a mixed environment with elevated volatility (VIX at 23.37) and a strong U.S. dollar (DXY at 103.84), which typically pressures risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The recent announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has introduced uncertainty, leading traders to hedge with puts across BTC, ETH, and SOL. This has caused a dip in market sentiment, despite some bullish accumulation in ETH. SOL and DOGE have faced additional pressure due to their exclusion from the reserve plan, while USDT remains stable but faces geopolitical risks with the freezing of assets on a Russian exchange.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While the strategic reserve announcement introduces long-term bullish potential, current market sentiment is cautious with increased hedging activity. Maintain a moderate positive stance due to its reserve asset status.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite short-term hedging, whale accumulation and contrarian signals from low social sentiment suggest potential upside. Maintain a slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — The exclusion from the strategic reserve and internal disagreements have dampened sentiment. Despite bullish technicals, maintain a neutral stance due to external uncertainties.

DOGE: -0.1 — Current holdings allow for a slight reduction given the lack of inclusion in the reserve plan and ongoing legal uncertainties. Maintain a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of market volatility and geopolitical risks, maintain a higher allocation to USDT as a safe haven, providing stability amid uncertain conditions."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 23.37. The U.S. Dollar Index is steady, and there is no significant movement in gold or crude oil prices. The crypto market is experiencing mixed signals, with Bitcoin being recognized as a strategic reserve asset by the U.S., which has led to increased hedging activity with put options. Ethereum and Solana are seeing similar protective trading behavior, while Solana faces additional pressure due to its exclusion from the primary reserve. Dogecoin has dropped due to disappointment over not being included in the reserve plan. Tether's freezing of assets on a Russian exchange has not significantly impacted its stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish signals, the strategic reserve recognition provides a long-term positive outlook. However, hedging activity suggests caution, warranting a moderate increase.

ETH: +0.1 — While technical indicators are not bullish, whale accumulation and low social sentiment as a contrarian signal provide a slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish technicals but negative news sentiment due to reserve exclusion. Hold current position until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent price declines and negative sentiment from reserve exclusion suggest reducing exposure, though current holdings are relatively small.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed market conditions and increased hedging activity, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is prudent for risk management."
2025-03-08 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context suggests a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The easing of banking regulations in the U.S. is a significant positive development for the crypto market, potentially increasing institutional interest. However, the broader market sentiment appears mixed, with Bitcoin receiving a boost from the announcement of a strategic reserve, while Ethereum faces caution due to significant ETF outflows. Solana experienced a short-term rally driven by summit anticipation but faced a subsequent decline, reflecting broader altcoin weakness. Dogecoin is under pressure, with critical support levels being tested, while Tether remains stable without significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — The strategic reserve announcement and easing banking regulations are positive for Bitcoin, suggesting increased institutional interest. Despite mixed technical signals, the news supports a moderate buy signal.

**ETH: 0.0** — Despite the withdrawal from Ethereum ETFs, the underlying interest remains. The lack of significant bullish news and mixed technicals suggest a neutral stance.

**SOL: +0.2** — Although Solana faced a decline post-summit, the prior momentum and anticipation of positive developments suggest a cautious buy, given its potential for recovery.

**DOGE: -0.3** — With critical support levels under threat and no significant positive news, reducing exposure is prudent to mitigate potential losses.

**USDT: +0.1** — Maintaining a slight preference for stability amid mixed market signals, as the overall sentiment does not strongly favor risk-on positioning."
2025-03-08 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by relatively high volatility, as indicated by the elevated VIX, and a stable U.S. Dollar Index. The recent easing of banking regulations in the U.S. is a significant development that could enhance institutional involvement in the crypto market, particularly benefiting Bitcoin. However, Ethereum is experiencing investor caution, as evidenced by significant outflows from ETFs. Solana's recent price surge was short-lived, with a subsequent decline following unmet expectations from a crypto summit. Dogecoin faces critical technical support levels, and a breach could lead to significant losses. Overall, the market sentiment is mixed, with Bitcoin potentially benefiting from regulatory changes, while other altcoins face varying degrees of pressure.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The strategic reserve announcement and easing of banking regulations are positive for Bitcoin, suggesting increased institutional interest and potential price support.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the regulatory environment potentially benefiting Ethereum, significant ETF outflows indicate caution among investors, balancing the overall sentiment.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent price volatility and underperformance following the summit suggest caution, although the previous momentum indicates potential for recovery.

DOGE: -0.3 — Approaching critical support levels with potential for significant downside if breached, warranting a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against market fluctuations."
2025-03-08 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a mixed environment with stable oil prices and a relatively strong U.S. dollar index, while the S&P 500 is at a high level, indicating potential risk-on sentiment. However, the elevated VIX suggests caution due to market volatility. In the crypto market, Bitcoin is experiencing regulatory tailwinds with the U.S. government's strategic reserve initiative, potentially boosting institutional interest. Ethereum faces investor caution as significant withdrawals from ETFs indicate profit-taking. Solana has seen recent volatility driven by summit-related speculation, while Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level. Tether remains stable without significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive regulatory news and potential institutional interest provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin. Despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals, the strategic reserve initiative is a long-term positive.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant outflows from Ethereum ETFs suggest caution and profit-taking, which, combined with neutral technical indicators, warrant a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility and a sell-off post-summit, Solana's previous momentum and potential for recovery justify a modest positive allocation, especially if broader market sentiment improves.

DOGE: -0.1 — With Dogecoin at a critical support level, the risk of a significant drop if this level is breached suggests a cautious stance, though not a full reduction given the current holdings.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market signals and potential volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer and flexibility to capitalize on future opportunities."
2025-03-08 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

The current macroeconomic environment presents a mixed sentiment with high volatility as indicated by the VIX at 24.87, suggesting uncertainty in the broader market. The easing of banking regulations in the U.S. is a positive development for the crypto sector, potentially increasing institutional involvement. Bitcoin benefits from the strategic reserve news, indicating a long-term bullish sentiment. Ethereum faces investor caution with significant outflows from ETFs, reflecting short-term bearish sentiment despite underlying interest. Solana experienced a brief rally due to summit anticipation but underperformed post-event, indicating volatility and potential overvaluation. Dogecoin is at a critical support level, with risks of significant downside if breached. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive sentiment from U.S. strategic reserve news and easing banking regulations suggest potential institutional inflows, supporting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite underlying interest, significant ETF outflows indicate caution. Hold position as sentiment remains mixed with no clear directional bias.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent underperformance post-summit and broader altcoin slump suggest a cautious approach, with potential for further downside.

DOGE: -0.3 — Critical support level at $0.19 under pressure; risk of steep losses if breached. Reduce exposure to mitigate potential downside.

USDT: +0.2 — Maintain a slightly higher allocation in USDT as a hedge against market volatility and uncertainty, providing liquidity for potential opportunities."

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by relatively high volatility, as indicated by the elevated VIX, and a strong U.S. dollar index. This suggests a cautious risk environment, which could impact crypto markets. The recent news highlights a significant development for Bitcoin, with the U.S. government establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, potentially increasing institutional interest and stability in BTC. Ethereum faces investor caution, as evidenced by significant withdrawals from ETFs, despite regulatory easing for banks. Solana experienced a brief rally due to summit anticipation but underperformed following unmet expectations. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, with potential for significant downside if breached. USDT remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve by the U.S. government and easing banking regulations provide strong institutional support, making BTC relatively attractive in the current environment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite regulatory easing, the recent significant ETF withdrawals indicate investor caution, balancing the potential for institutional support with current market hesitancy.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana underperformed post-summit, the initial rally suggests some underlying strength. However, broader altcoin weakness tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: -0.3 — DOGE is at a critical support level, and the risk of a significant drop if this level is breached warrants reducing exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the cautious macro environment and potential for increased institutional interest in BTC, a moderate reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to capitalize on potential BTC upside."
2025-03-08 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and stable interest rates, with the S&P 500 showing strength, which could indicate a potential risk-on sentiment. However, the crypto market is experiencing mixed signals. Bitcoin is seeing positive regulatory developments with the U.S. government establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations, which could boost institutional involvement. Ethereum faces caution as significant funds have been withdrawn from ETFs, indicating profit-taking. Solana experienced a brief rally due to summit anticipation but has since underperformed following unmet expectations. Dogecoin is under pressure, with critical support levels being tested, and Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive regulatory news and increased institutional involvement potential make Bitcoin attractive, despite the lack of immediate bullish technical signals.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent ETF outflows suggest caution, and technical indicators remain neutral, leading to a slightly negative outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — After a brief rally, Solana's momentum has faded, and it is underperforming in the broader altcoin market, suggesting a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.3 — With critical support levels under threat and no positive catalysts, reducing exposure is prudent to avoid potential steep losses.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for volatility, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation is sensible to manage risk and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-03-08 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and stable interest rates, with the S&P 500 showing resilience. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is gaining institutional support with the U.S. government's strategic reserve initiative, potentially boosting its long-term appeal. Ethereum faces caution as significant capital outflows from ETFs suggest profit-taking amidst volatility. Solana experienced a brief rally due to speculative optimism but has since corrected, reflecting broader altcoin market challenges. Dogecoin is at a critical technical juncture, with potential for significant downside if support levels fail. Tether remains stable, with no significant news affecting its status as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional support from the U.S. government and easing banking regulations are strong bullish indicators, suggesting increased long-term confidence and potential capital inflow.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent ETF outflows indicate caution among investors, and the lack of bullish technical signals suggests a need to reduce exposure slightly.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent underperformance, the prior momentum and anticipation around the crypto summit indicate potential for recovery, albeit with caution.

DOGE: -0.5 — The risk of breaching key support levels and the potential for steep losses warrant a reduction in exposure to mitigate downside risk.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed sentiment in the crypto market and potential volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2025-03-08 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a mix of positive regulatory developments and investor caution. Bitcoin's inclusion in a U.S. strategic reserve and eased banking regulations are bullish signals for institutional involvement, potentially boosting Bitcoin's appeal. However, Ethereum faces investor caution with significant ETF outflows, indicating profit-taking amidst volatility. Solana experienced a short-term rally due to summit anticipation but underperformed post-summit, reflecting broader altcoin sentiment. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, with potential for significant downside if breached. The macroeconomic context, with high volatility and stable gold prices, suggests a mixed risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive regulatory news and strategic reserve inclusion bolster long-term institutional interest, despite current technical neutrality.

ETH: 0.0 — ETF outflows indicate caution, balancing the lack of significant bullish news or technical signals.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent rally driven by summit anticipation shows potential, but post-summit underperformance tempers enthusiasm.

DOGE: -0.3 — Critical support level under pressure, with potential for significant downside, justifying reduced exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — Increased volatility and mixed market sentiment support maintaining liquidity in stablecoins for potential reallocation opportunities."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. The macroeconomic context shows elevated volatility (VIX at 24.87) and a strong U.S. dollar index (DXY at 103.84), which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent news about the U.S. government creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations could provide long-term bullish support, but the immediate market reaction remains muted. Ethereum faces investor caution as evidenced by significant outflows from ETFs, while Solana's recent rally has been overshadowed by a broader altcoin slump post-summit. Dogecoin is at a critical support level, with potential for steep losses if breached. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the lack of immediate bullish signals, the strategic reserve news and eased banking regulations could provide medium-term support. Maintain a slight positive bias.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent ETF outflows and no significant bullish momentum. Hold current position without increasing exposure.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent underperformance following summit hype suggests caution. Reduce exposure slightly due to potential for further downside.

DOGE: -0.3 — Approaching critical support level with risk of significant decline. Reduce exposure to mitigate potential losses.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and lack of strong bullish signals in other assets, maintain a slightly higher allocation to USDT as a safe haven."
2025-03-08 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by relatively high volatility (VIX at 24.87) and a strong U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 103.84), which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Despite this, the recent easing of banking regulations in the U.S. is a significant positive development for the crypto market, potentially increasing institutional involvement. Bitcoin's strategic reserve announcement could bolster long-term confidence, although immediate price action remains subdued. Ethereum is experiencing investor caution, as evidenced by significant ETF outflows, while Solana's recent rally was short-lived, reflecting broader altcoin market weakness. Dogecoin faces critical technical support challenges, and Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The strategic reserve news and regulatory easing are positive long-term signals, though short-term technicals are neutral. The potential for increased institutional involvement supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the regulatory easing, significant ETF outflows indicate investor caution. The technicals remain neutral, warranting a hold position.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent volatility and underperformance post-summit suggest caution. The short-lived rally indicates potential overvaluation, justifying a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — With critical support under pressure and the risk of a significant drop if breached, reducing exposure is prudent given current holdings.

USDT: +0.3 — In a volatile environment with mixed signals across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-03-08 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt, as indicated by the recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. The macroeconomic context, with elevated volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a risk-off environment. Notably, Bitcoin has received a boost from the U.S. government's decision to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which could support its long-term value. However, Ethereum has faced significant outflows from ETFs, reflecting investor caution. Solana experienced a brief rally due to summit anticipation but has since underperformed. Dogecoin is at a critical support level, with potential for significant downside if breached. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, benefiting from its safe-haven status in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The establishment of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations are positive long-term developments, providing a supportive backdrop despite current bearish technical indicators.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent ETF outflows indicating caution, but no significant bearish momentum. Holding position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent underperformance following summit disappointment and broader altcoin slump suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly while monitoring for stabilization.

DOGE: -0.5 — Approaching critical support with potential for significant downside if breached. Reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

USDT: +0.2 — In a risk-off environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent. Positive momentum indicators support a slight increase in exposure."
2025-03-08 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears mixed, with macroeconomic indicators showing a relatively stable environment but with heightened volatility as indicated by the VIX. Bitcoin is experiencing a significant regulatory shift in the U.S., which could boost institutional interest and long-term stability. Ethereum is facing investor caution as evidenced by significant ETF outflows, suggesting a period of profit-taking. Solana saw a brief rally due to anticipation of the crypto summit, but the subsequent sell-off indicates vulnerability in altcoin markets. Dogecoin is under pressure, with critical support levels being tested, which could lead to significant downside if breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The creation of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and regulatory easing for banks are positive developments that could enhance institutional adoption and long-term value, despite current technical indicators showing no immediate buy signals.

ETH: -0.3 — The significant outflows from Ethereum ETFs indicate investor caution and potential short-term downside risk, despite some bullish momentum signals.

SOL: +0.2 — Although Solana experienced a sell-off post-summit, the previous rally suggests underlying interest, and it remains a potential candidate for capital rotation if market conditions improve.

DOGE: -0.5 — With key support levels under threat, Dogecoin faces potential steep losses, warranting a reduction in exposure given the current holdings.

USDT: +0.1 — Despite the stablecoin's typical role as a safe haven, the current market environment suggests maintaining a slightly higher allocation to manage risk amidst volatility."
2025-03-08 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Bitcoin is experiencing a boost from regulatory developments, as the U.S. government plans to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset, and banks are now cleared to engage in crypto activities. This regulatory support could drive institutional interest in Bitcoin. Ethereum, however, is facing investor caution as significant withdrawals from Ethereum ETFs indicate profit-taking amidst volatility. Solana experienced a short-term rally due to anticipation around a crypto summit, but the momentum faded quickly, leading to a broader altcoin slump. Dogecoin is under pressure with critical technical support levels being tested, posing a risk of significant downside if breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive regulatory news and increased institutional involvement provide strong support for Bitcoin, suggesting potential for further upside.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and on-chain activity, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent rally has lost momentum, and broader altcoin weakness suggests caution, though not enough to warrant a strong sell signal given current holdings.

DOGE: -0.5 — Technical support risks and lack of positive catalysts suggest reducing exposure to mitigate potential losses.

USDT: -0.3 — With a cautiously optimistic market sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT is appropriate to capitalize on growth opportunities."

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant developments potentially influencing future trends. Bitcoin's strategic reserve announcement by the U.S. government and the easing of banking regulations are likely to bolster institutional interest and support BTC's price. Ethereum, despite recent withdrawals from ETFs, maintains underlying interest, though investor caution is evident. Solana experienced a brief rally due to summit anticipation but faced a sell-off as expectations weren't met. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, with potential for significant downside if breached. USDT remains stable with no significant news, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strategic reserve announcement and eased banking regulations provide strong institutional support, coupled with bullish momentum signals.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF withdrawals, bullish momentum and potential for institutional interest remain, though caution is warranted.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent volatility and underperformance post-summit suggest a neutral stance until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: -0.3 — Critical support level under pressure; potential for significant downside if breached, justifying reduced exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — Favorable macro developments for risk assets suggest a rotation out of stablecoins, though maintaining some exposure for risk management."
2025-03-08 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing bullish momentum and increased institutional involvement following regulatory easing in the U.S. Ethereum is facing some investor caution as evidenced by significant withdrawals from ETFs, despite maintaining bullish momentum in technical indicators. Solana saw a temporary surge due to anticipation around a crypto summit, but the subsequent sell-off reflects broader altcoin weakness. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, with potential for significant downside if breached. In this environment, USDT remains stable, serving as a safe haven amid mixed signals across other assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and bullish momentum, coupled with positive regulatory developments, make Bitcoin an attractive asset for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and a positive trend signal, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent volatility and underperformance post-summit suggest caution, but not enough to warrant a strong sell signal given current holdings.

DOGE: -0.3 — Approaching critical support levels with potential for significant downside; reducing exposure is prudent given current holdings.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of mixed market signals and potential volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer and flexibility for future reallocation."
2025-03-08 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a mix of bullish and bearish signals across different assets. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, supported by significant institutional developments such as the U.S. government's strategic Bitcoin reserve and eased banking regulations, which could boost institutional involvement. Ethereum, despite recent withdrawals from ETFs, maintains bullish momentum, although investor caution is evident. Solana has seen volatility, with initial optimism from the crypto summit fading, leading to a recent decline. Dogecoin is under pressure, with critical support levels being tested. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Strong institutional developments and bullish momentum suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. The strategic reserve news and eased banking regulations could drive further institutional interest.

**ETH: +0.3** — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and a buy signal from technical indicators. The overall sentiment remains cautiously positive, warranting a moderate allocation.

**SOL: -0.1** — Recent volatility and underperformance following the crypto summit suggest caution. While there was initial optimism, the subsequent decline indicates potential instability.

**DOGE: -0.5** — Critical support levels are under pressure, and the risk of a significant drop if breached suggests reducing exposure to mitigate potential losses.

**USDT: -0.2** — While maintaining a stable position, the overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, suggesting a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings to allocate capital towards more promising assets."
2025-03-08 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed sentiment with high volatility (VIX at 24.87) and a strong U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 103.84), which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, recent regulatory developments in the U.S., such as the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the easing of banking restrictions on crypto services, are likely to boost institutional interest in Bitcoin and potentially other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum has experienced significant outflows from ETFs, indicating caution among investors despite underlying interest. Solana showed a brief rally due to summit anticipation but has since underperformed following unmet expectations. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, with potential for steep losses if breached. USDT remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive regulatory news and strategic reserve creation are likely to boost institutional interest and demand, supporting a strong buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and buy signals, warranting a cautious positive stance.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent underperformance and fading summit hype suggest caution, though no strong sell signal is present given the broader market context.

DOGE: 0.0 — At a critical support level with mixed signals; maintain a neutral stance until clearer direction emerges.

USDT: -0.5 — Favorable regulatory news and potential capital rotation into riskier assets suggest reducing stablecoin exposure to capitalize on growth opportunities in other cryptocurrencies."

Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Bitcoin is buoyed by significant regulatory developments, such as the U.S. government's decision to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the easing of banking regulations, which could enhance institutional involvement. Ethereum faces mixed signals with substantial withdrawals from ETFs indicating profit-taking, although underlying interest remains. Solana experienced a short-term rally driven by anticipation of the crypto summit but faced a subsequent decline as expectations were not met. Dogecoin is under pressure with critical support levels being tested, while USDT remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive regulatory news and strong on-chain activity suggest continued institutional interest and support for Bitcoin, making it a preferred asset in the current environment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum's technical indicators remain bullish, and the asset is still attractive given its strong market position and potential for recovery.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent underperformance following the summit and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution, although long-term prospects remain intact.

DOGE: -0.5 — Critical technical support levels are under threat, increasing the risk of a significant downturn, warranting reduced exposure.

USDT: -0.4 — With positive developments in other cryptocurrencies and a slight increase in risk appetite, there is less need to hold a large stablecoin position."
2025-03-08 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, supported by significant regulatory developments, including the U.S. government's creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and eased banking regulations for crypto services. Ethereum, despite positive momentum, faces investor caution as evidenced by substantial withdrawals from ETFs. Solana has seen volatility, initially rallying on summit anticipation but later declining due to unmet expectations. Dogecoin is under technical pressure, with analysts warning of potential sharp declines if key support levels are breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations. Overall, the macroeconomic context suggests a cautious approach, with high volatility and mixed sentiment across assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong regulatory support and bullish momentum make Bitcoin an attractive asset, despite the lack of a clear trend signal. The strategic reserve news could bolster long-term confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and potential breakout signals. However, caution is warranted due to recent profit-taking.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent volatility and underperformance post-summit suggest a cautious stance. The initial rally has faded, and broader altcoin weakness is a concern.

DOGE: -0.5 — Technical pressure and the risk of breaching key support levels necessitate reducing exposure, especially given the lack of bullish signals.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of mixed market sentiment and potential volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer and liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-03-08 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed picture with a relatively high 10-Year Treasury Yield and a strong U.S. Dollar Index, which might exert pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. However, the easing of banking regulations in the U.S. is a positive development for crypto, potentially increasing institutional participation. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum supported by favorable news about a strategic Bitcoin reserve and relaxed banking regulations. Ethereum, despite recent outflows from ETFs, maintains bullish technical indicators, suggesting underlying strength. Solana's recent rally was driven by anticipation of positive outcomes from a crypto summit, but the subsequent sell-off indicates volatility. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, and a breach could lead to significant downside. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market uncertainties.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and supportive news from the U.S. government and banking sector suggest increased institutional interest, making BTC an attractive asset.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum's technical indicators remain bullish, and it benefits from the broader positive sentiment in the crypto market.

SOL: +0.1 — Recent volatility and mixed news sentiment suggest caution, but technical indicators show some bullish momentum, warranting a modest positive score.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE is at a critical support level with no clear directional bias; maintaining a neutral stance is prudent given the potential for significant downside if support is breached.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive developments in the crypto market and increased risk appetite, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to reallocate capital to more promising assets."
2025-03-08 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing slight upward momentum. Bitcoin is buoyed by significant regulatory developments in the U.S., which could increase institutional participation. Ethereum, despite recent ETF outflows, maintains bullish technical indicators. Solana experienced a brief rally driven by anticipation of the White House crypto summit but faced a subsequent pullback. Dogecoin is under pressure, with analysts warning of potential sharp declines if key support levels are breached. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strategic reserve announcement and easing of banking regulations are strong bullish signals, supported by positive momentum indicators.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, technical indicators remain bullish, suggesting continued interest and potential for recovery.

SOL: +0.3 — Recent momentum and anticipation-driven rally indicate potential for gains, though caution is warranted due to recent pullback.

DOGE: -0.1 — With critical support levels under threat, maintaining a cautious stance is prudent, especially given the minimal current holdings.

USDT: -0.5 — With positive sentiment across major cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin exposure to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets is advisable."
2025-03-08 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a bullish tilt, primarily driven by regulatory developments and institutional interest. Bitcoin is seeing positive momentum as the U.S. government establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve, coupled with eased banking regulations, which could enhance institutional adoption. Ethereum, however, faces mixed signals with significant ETF outflows suggesting profit-taking amidst volatility. Solana experienced a temporary surge due to summit anticipation but faced a sell-off as expectations were unmet. Dogecoin is under pressure with critical support levels being tested, while Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and regulatory developments are likely to enhance Bitcoin's appeal, with bullish momentum and on-chain activity supporting further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and technical buy signals, suggesting potential for recovery as volatility stabilizes.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent volatility and unmet summit expectations have neutralized Solana's short-term outlook, warranting a cautious hold position until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: -0.1 — Critical support levels are under threat, and while momentum is slightly positive, the risk of a significant drop necessitates a cautious reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With a generally bullish market sentiment and capital rotation towards riskier assets, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets is advisable."

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most major cryptocurrencies, despite some mixed news and technical signals. Bitcoin is buoyed by significant regulatory developments, including the U.S. government's strategic reserve initiative and eased banking regulations, which are likely to enhance institutional participation. Ethereum faces some profit-taking pressure as investors withdraw from ETFs, indicating caution amid volatility. Solana experienced a short-lived rally driven by summit anticipation, but it underperformed following unmet expectations. Dogecoin is at a critical technical juncture, with potential for significant downside if key support levels are breached. Tether remains stable, with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive regulatory news and bullish momentum suggest strong potential for further gains. The strategic reserve initiative is particularly supportive for long-term institutional interest.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, bullish technical signals and underlying interest remain. The cautious sentiment is balanced by potential for recovery.

SOL: +0.2 — Although recent summit-related optimism faded, the asset still shows bullish momentum. However, caution is warranted due to recent underperformance.

DOGE: -0.1 — Currently held asset with bearish technical risks. The potential breach of key support levels suggests caution, but no immediate action is warranted.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-08 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of institutional interest and regulatory easing, which could bolster its appeal as a reserve asset. Ethereum faces mixed signals with significant outflows from ETFs, indicating profit-taking and investor caution despite underlying interest. Solana experienced a short-term rally driven by anticipation of inclusion in strategic reserves, but this was followed by a sell-off due to unmet expectations at the crypto summit. Dogecoin is facing critical technical support levels, with potential for significant downside if breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Institutional interest and regulatory easing provide strong support for Bitcoin, enhancing its long-term appeal as a reserve asset.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum, supported by positive technical indicators.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent volatility and sell-off post-summit balance out earlier optimism, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.3 — Critical support levels are under pressure, and a breach could lead to significant losses, warranting caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2025-03-09 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed, with macroeconomic uncertainties weighing on risk assets, particularly Bitcoin, which has seen a recent sell-off. Ethereum shows signs of potential recovery driven by whale accumulation, while Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity boosts. Dogecoin remains under bearish pressure after a significant monthly decline. Meanwhile, Tether's integration into new platforms suggests stable demand for USDT, providing a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, macroeconomic concerns and recent sell-offs suggest caution. Holding current positions with a slight reduction in exposure is prudent.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and technical consolidation indicate potential for a rally. Increasing exposure is warranted given the positive on-chain signals.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the overall bearish YTD performance and lack of strong buy signals suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

DOGE: -0.1 — Continued bearish pressure and recent declines warrant a cautious stance. Slight reduction in exposure is advisable.

USDT: +0.3 — With macro uncertainties and market volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity for potential market opportunities."
2025-03-09 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a bearish tilt, influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, testing its 200-day moving average, which reflects broader economic concerns impacting risk assets. Ethereum shows signs of potential recovery due to whale accumulation, though it remains in a technical consolidation phase. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections and new developments in its ecosystem. Dogecoin has faced a sharp decline over the past month, with mixed forecasts around its current support level. Tether remains stable, with increased adoption and integration activities.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent significant drop and macroeconomic concerns suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and technical consolidation indicate potential for a rebound. Increasing exposure could capitalize on a possible rally.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite ecosystem developments, the year-to-date decline and lack of strong buy signals suggest a neutral stance. Hold current positions.

DOGE: -0.1 — Continued bearish pressure and recent sharp declines warrant a slight reduction in exposure, though the position is minimal.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the macroeconomic uncertainty and Bitcoin's recent drop, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against volatility."

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is marked by uncertainty, with broader economic concerns such as tariffs and Fed policy impacting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a recent sell-off, reflecting this macro fragility, while Ethereum shows signs of potential accumulation by whales, suggesting a possible rally. Solana continues to face challenges despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin is under bearish pressure with significant monthly losses. Tether remains stable, with increased adoption through platform integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish technical signals, recent macro-driven sell-offs and negative news sentiment suggest caution. Reducing exposure is prudent given current volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rally, and technical consolidation around $2.2K provides a promising setup for a rebound.

SOL: -0.3 — Continued year-to-date decline and lack of strong buy signals suggest reducing exposure, especially given broader market uncertainty.

DOGE: -0.4 — Persistent bearish pressure and recent sharp declines warrant reducing exposure, despite potential short-term support.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of macro uncertainty and bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure is advisable for portfolio stability."
2025-03-09 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bearish and bullish signals. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties and broader economic concerns, which have affected risk assets. Ethereum shows signs of potential recovery due to whale accumulation, although it remains in a technical consolidation phase. Solana is struggling with a year-to-date decline despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin has faced a sharp drop over the past month, hovering near key support levels. Tether remains stable, with no major disruptions, and continues to see expanded use cases through platform integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, recent news highlights macroeconomic pressures and a significant price drop, suggesting caution is warranted.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rally, and technical consolidation suggests a promising range for upside movement.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite some bullish momentum signals, the overall negative YTD performance and lack of strong buy signals suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — Continued bearish pressure and significant recent losses warrant a cautious approach, though key support levels may offer some stability.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the uncertain market environment and recent BTC drop, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins for risk management is prudent."
2025-03-09 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a bearish undertone, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Fed policy, which have led to a broader sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, testing its 200-day moving average, while Ethereum shows signs of potential accumulation by whales, suggesting a possible rally. Solana and Dogecoin have faced significant year-to-date losses, with Solana struggling despite liquidity injections and Dogecoin hovering near critical support levels. Tether remains stable, with increased integration and adoption, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the macroeconomic context and recent price declines suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rally, and technical consolidation provides a promising setup. Slightly increasing exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the lack of a strong trend signal and significant YTD losses warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.5 — Persistent bearish pressure and significant monthly losses suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the macro uncertainty and bearish sentiment in risk assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT for stability and liquidity."
2025-03-09 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite ecosystem developments, the significant YTD decline and lack of strong buy signals suggest maintaining current exposure.

DOGE: -0.5 — Persistent bearish pressure and recent sharp decline warrant reducing exposure to manage risk.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current macroeconomic uncertainties and recent market volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-03-09 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment reflects heightened volatility and uncertainty, with the S&P 500 and VIX indicating increased market stress. Bitcoin has experienced a significant sell-off, influenced by broader economic concerns and technical pressures, while Ethereum shows signs of potential accumulation by large holders, suggesting a possible rally. Solana continues to face challenges despite recent liquidity injections, and Dogecoin remains under bearish pressure with substantial monthly losses. Tether maintains stability with expanding use cases, reflecting its role as a safe haven amid market turbulence.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent sell-offs and macroeconomic pressures suggest caution, despite some technical buy signals. Holding but reducing exposure slightly.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, though technicals remain cautious. Slightly increasing allocation in anticipation of a possible rally.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, broader market weakness and year-to-date losses warrant a neutral stance. Holding position without changes.

DOGE: -0.5 — Continued bearish sentiment and significant monthly losses suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT as a safe haven is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is marked by heightened volatility and uncertainty, as evidenced by the elevated VIX and fluctuating asset prices. Bitcoin has experienced significant downward pressure due to broader economic concerns, including tariffs and Federal Reserve policies, which have impacted risk assets. Ethereum shows signs of potential recovery, with whale accumulation suggesting a possible rally. Solana, despite recent liquidity injections, continues to face challenges, while Dogecoin remains under bearish pressure, having suffered substantial losses over the past month. Tether remains stable, with increased adoption in global transactions, indicating a steady demand for stablecoins amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite some bullish technical signals, macroeconomic concerns and recent price drops suggest caution. Reducing exposure aligns with risk management.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and a promising technical range provide a positive outlook, though caution is warranted due to broader market conditions.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the overall bearish sentiment and year-to-date performance warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.3 — Continued bearish pressure and significant monthly losses suggest reducing exposure, especially given the lack of strong recovery signals.

USDT: +0.5 — In a volatile market, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against potential downturns and offers liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-03-09 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a bearish tilt, primarily influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties and recent sell-offs. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, reflecting broader economic concerns and macro fragility. Ethereum shows signs of potential recovery driven by whale accumulation, although it remains in a technical consolidation phase. Solana, despite liquidity injections, continues to face downward pressure, while Dogecoin is struggling with a sharp monthly decline. Tether remains stable with increased integration and adoption, suggesting a preference for stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some bullish technical indicators, recent news highlights significant downward pressure and macroeconomic concerns, warranting a cautious reduction in exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation suggests potential for a rally, and while technicals are mixed, the accumulation trend provides a positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite buy signals, the overall YTD performance and market sentiment remain negative, balancing out the potential for short-term gains.

DOGE: -0.5 — Persistent bearish sentiment and significant recent losses suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility."
2025-03-09 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility and uncertainty, with broader economic concerns impacting risk assets. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, reflecting this macro fragility, while Ethereum shows potential for a rally driven by whale accumulation. Solana, despite recent liquidity injections, continues to face downward pressure, and Dogecoin remains under bearish influence with significant monthly losses. Tether remains stable, with increased integration and adoption but no significant market-moving events.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent sell-off and macroeconomic concerns suggest caution. Despite some bullish momentum signals, the overall sentiment remains bearish, and BTC is testing key support levels.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, and technical consolidation around $2.2K suggests a promising range for upside movement.

SOL: +0.1 — Despite a year-to-date decline, recent developments in the Solana ecosystem and bullish momentum signals provide a slight positive outlook.

DOGE: -0.2 — Continued bearish pressure and significant monthly losses warrant caution, though the price is near a potential support level.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current uncertain market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT offers a safe haven and liquidity advantage."
2025-03-09 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies, which have led to a significant sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, nearing its 200-day moving average, while Ethereum shows some potential for a turnaround due to whale accumulation. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin faces persistent bearish pressure with a significant monthly loss. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with increased adoption and integration activities, suggesting a preference for liquidity and safety amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is facing bearish macroeconomic pressures and technical breakdowns, with recent price declines indicating a cautious stance is warranted.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent sell-offs, whale accumulation suggests potential for a rebound, making ETH relatively more attractive in the current environment.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's ongoing struggles and lack of strong positive catalysts keep it neutral, despite some bullish technical signals.

DOGE: -0.7 — Significant monthly losses and bearish technical indicators suggest reducing exposure to Dogecoin, given its weak performance and market sentiment.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides liquidity and safety, aligning with the current risk-averse sentiment."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility and uncertainty, with the S&P 500 showing signs of stress and the VIX indicating increased market anxiety. Bitcoin has experienced a significant sell-off, driven by broader economic concerns and technical breakdowns, suggesting a bearish sentiment. Ethereum, despite recent accumulation by whales, remains in a consolidation phase, indicating cautious optimism. Solana continues to face challenges despite liquidity injections, while Dogecoin is under significant bearish pressure, having lost substantial value recently. Tether remains stable, with increased integration and adoption, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sell-off and bearish macroeconomic factors suggest reducing exposure to BTC, despite some bullish on-chain signals.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation hints at potential upside, but the overall technical outlook remains cautious, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite year-to-date losses, positive developments in the ecosystem and technical buy signals suggest a slight increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Continued bearish pressure and low on-chain activity suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing risk.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of market volatility and bearish sentiment across risk assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity."
2025-03-09 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant macroeconomic uncertainties impacting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, driven by broader economic concerns such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies. Ethereum, while also under pressure, shows signs of potential accumulation by large holders, suggesting a possible future rally. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin faces persistent bearish pressure with a substantial monthly loss. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with increased integration and adoption, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The bearish macroeconomic environment and recent price breakdowns suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, despite holding a small position.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum is under technical consolidation, whale accumulation hints at potential upside, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite positive technical signals, the broader bearish market and YTD decline suggest maintaining current exposure without further allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed forecasts and ongoing bearish pressure indicate no clear signal for change, maintaining a neutral stance given the minimal current holding.

USDT: +0.8 — In light of bearish market conditions and increased macroeconomic uncertainty, maintaining a high allocation in USDT as a safe haven is prudent."
2025-03-09 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with macroeconomic uncertainties and recent sell-offs impacting risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, nearing its 200-day moving average, reflecting broader economic concerns. Ethereum, despite a whale-driven accumulation, remains in a technical consolidation phase. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin has seen a sharp monthly decline. In contrast, USDT remains stable with increased integration and adoption, suggesting a preference for stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The bearish sentiment and macroeconomic pressures are weighing heavily on Bitcoin, with recent price declines and lack of bullish signals indicating a need to reduce exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the bearish market, whale accumulation suggests potential for a rebound, and the technical consolidation provides a cautiously optimistic outlook.

SOL: -0.2 — Continued year-to-date decline and recent price drops suggest caution, though ecosystem developments may offer future potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — Significant recent losses and mixed forecasts around key support levels indicate a neutral stance, with no strong signals for immediate action.

USDT: +0.4 — In the current bearish environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent, providing stability and liquidity."
2025-03-09 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies, which have led to a significant sell-off across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, but technical indicators remain cautious; maintain a slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite technological developments, the overall bearish sentiment and significant YTD losses warrant a neutral stance.

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Macroeconomic uncertainties, including concerns over tariffs and Federal Reserve policies, are contributing to risk aversion among investors. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, approaching its 200-day moving average, while Ethereum shows signs of potential accumulation by whales, hinting at a possible future rally. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin is facing persistent bearish pressure. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with increased integration and adoption, suggesting a preference for safety amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The bearish macroeconomic environment and recent price declines suggest reducing exposure to BTC. Despite on-chain activity surges, the overall sentiment remains weak.

ETH: +0.2 — Although ETH has experienced price declines, whale accumulation indicates potential for a future rally, warranting a cautious increase in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Despite efforts to address congestion and liquidity injections, SOL's significant YTD decline and current bearish sentiment suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.5 — With a sharp monthly loss and ongoing bearish pressure, reducing exposure to DOGE is prudent given its current volatility and lack of positive catalysts.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, offering a safe haven amid broader market uncertainty."
2025-03-09 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties and recent sell-offs. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, reflecting broader economic concerns and risk aversion. Ethereum shows signs of potential accumulation by whales, suggesting a possible future rally despite current bearish trends. Solana continues to struggle with a year-to-date decline, despite efforts to boost liquidity and address network congestion. Dogecoin faces ongoing bearish pressure, with a significant monthly loss. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with increased integration and adoption, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Continued bearish momentum and macroeconomic pressures suggest reducing exposure, especially given the recent significant price drop and lack of bullish signals.

ETH: +0.2 — While currently bearish, whale accumulation hints at a potential future rally, warranting a cautious increase in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Despite efforts to boost liquidity, the persistent downtrend and significant YTD losses suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed forecasts and ongoing bearish pressure indicate a neutral stance, with no clear signals for increasing or decreasing exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current risk-averse environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, aligning with the bearish market sentiment."
2025-03-09 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable price drops, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies. Despite this, Ethereum shows potential for a rally due to whale accumulation. Solana continues to struggle, down 29% year-to-date, despite liquidity injections and ecosystem developments. Dogecoin faces persistent bearish pressure, with a sharp monthly decline. In contrast, Tether remains stable, with increased integration and adoption but no significant changes in minting or freezing activities. Given the current market conditions, a cautious approach with a focus on stability and potential recovery signals is advisable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is experiencing a bearish trend with price breakdowns and macroeconomic pressures. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current market environment.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the bearish sentiment, whale accumulation suggests potential for a recovery. A cautious increase in exposure is warranted.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's significant year-to-date decline and lack of positive momentum signals suggest reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's ongoing bearish pressure and lack of clear recovery signals warrant a neutral stance, maintaining current minimal exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and preserves capital."
2025-03-09 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is broadly bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, testing its 200-day moving average, while Ethereum shows potential for a rally due to whale accumulation despite recent price dips. Solana continues to struggle with a year-to-date decline, and Dogecoin faces persistent bearish pressure with a sharp monthly loss. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with increased integration and no adverse events reported, suggesting a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sell-off and macroeconomic concerns weigh heavily on Bitcoin, and its price remains under pressure, suggesting a cautious approach to holding BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the bearish market, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, making ETH relatively more attractive than other assets.

SOL: -0.3 — Continued year-to-date decline and lack of immediate positive catalysts suggest reducing exposure to SOL, despite minor ecosystem developments.

DOGE: -0.2 — Persistent bearish pressure and significant monthly losses warrant a reduction in DOGE holdings, even as it hovers near support levels.

USDT: +0.7 — In the current risk-off environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, given its stable price and increased integration."
2025-03-09 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment remains bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, reflecting broader macroeconomic uncertainties and risk aversion. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, influenced by macroeconomic concerns such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies, pushing it towards key technical levels. Ethereum shows potential for a turnaround due to whale accumulation, although it remains in a technical consolidation phase. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, while Dogecoin faces persistent bearish pressure despite hovering near support levels. Tether remains stable, with increased adoption through platform integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: 0.0 — Despite recent price declines and macroeconomic pressures, Bitcoin's technical levels suggest potential stabilization. However, the lack of clear bullish signals warrants a neutral stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rally, and while technical consolidation persists, the relative strength compared to other assets suggests a modest positive outlook.

SOL: -0.2 — Continued year-to-date decline and lack of strong bullish signals despite ecosystem developments suggest caution, especially given current holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, the overall bearish trend and mixed forecasts around support levels justify a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant macroeconomic uncertainties impacting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, influenced by broader economic concerns such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies. Ethereum, despite recent whale accumulation, remains in a technical consolidation phase, suggesting cautious optimism. Solana continues to struggle with a year-to-date decline, despite efforts to address network congestion through new solutions. Dogecoin has faced substantial losses over the past month, with mixed forecasts around its current support level. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with increased integration and adoption but no significant changes in its market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent declines, Bitcoin's price is stabilizing, and its historical resilience to macroeconomic pressures suggests potential for recovery. However, caution is warranted due to ongoing macro uncertainty.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rally, and Ethereum's technical position suggests a promising range for future gains. This makes ETH relatively attractive in the current environment.

SOL: -0.1 — Continued year-to-date decline and lack of immediate positive catalysts suggest caution. However, recent developments in the Solana ecosystem could provide long-term support.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed forecasts and recent sharp declines create uncertainty. The lack of strong bullish signals or significant news leaves DOGE in a neutral position.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current bearish market sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainties, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for flexibility in future capital deployment."
2025-03-09 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies impacting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, testing its 200-day moving average, while Ethereum shows potential for a rally due to whale accumulation despite recent technical consolidation. Solana continues to face challenges despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin remains under pressure with significant monthly losses. Tether remains stable, with increased integration but no major disruptions reported.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Recent significant price drop and macroeconomic concerns suggest continued bearish pressure. Current holdings should be reduced to manage risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, providing a moderate buy signal despite recent price consolidation.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite ecosystem developments, the overall bearish market sentiment and year-to-date decline suggest a hold position for now.

DOGE: -0.1 — Continued bearish pressure and significant monthly losses warrant maintaining minimal exposure, though no drastic changes are needed given the small current holding.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent to preserve capital and manage volatility."
2025-03-09 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties and broader economic concerns, which have led to a sell-off pushing its price closer to the 200-day moving average. Ethereum, despite the recent dip, shows signs of potential recovery driven by whale accumulation, suggesting a possible rally. Solana continues to struggle with a year-to-date decline, despite efforts to boost liquidity and address network congestion. Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline over the past month, with mixed forecasts around its current support level. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with ongoing integration efforts expanding its use cases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.8 — The bearish macroeconomic environment and significant recent price declines suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, especially given its proximity to the 200-day moving average.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, making Ethereum relatively more attractive in the current market context.

SOL: 0.0 — Continued downward trend and lack of significant positive developments or signals suggest maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation.

DOGE: -0.5 — With a sharp monthly decline and bearish sentiment, reducing exposure to Dogecoin is prudent given its current market conditions.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the bearish market sentiment and volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a stable hedge against further declines in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-03-09 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is marked by uncertainty, with broader economic concerns such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policy impacting risk assets. This has led to a recent decline in Bitcoin, which has dropped significantly, testing its 200-day moving average. Ethereum, however, shows signs of potential accumulation by large holders, suggesting a possible rally despite recent technical consolidation. Solana continues to face challenges despite liquidity injections, while Dogecoin has experienced a sharp decline over the past month, with mixed forecasts about its near-term support levels. Tether remains stable, with recent integrations expanding its use cases but no significant changes in its market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Given the recent significant drop and macroeconomic pressures, Bitcoin remains under bearish sentiment. The lack of strong buy signals and macro uncertainty suggests a cautious approach, reducing exposure slightly.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the recent dip, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound. The technical consolidation around $2.2K suggests a promising range for a potential turnaround, warranting a moderate increase in exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's ongoing challenges and lack of positive momentum signals suggest maintaining current exposure. The market remains cautious despite recent developments in the ecosystem.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no current holdings and mixed forecasts, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent. The recent sharp decline and lack of clear bullish signals do not justify new exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — In the face of macro uncertainty and bearish sentiment in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability. The stablecoin's recent integrations support its utility and attractiveness as a safe haven."
