2025-03-03 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The market sentiment is currently bullish, driven by significant developments such as the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve,"" which has led to notable price surges in these assets. Despite a recent retracement, the overall momentum remains positive, supported by bullish technical indicators across these cryptocurrencies. DOGE and USDT lack significant news catalysts, with DOGE experiencing minor price fluctuations and USDT maintaining its stablecoin characteristics. The macroeconomic environment, with relatively high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests cautious optimism, with potential for capital rotation into riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive sentiment from the strategic reserve news, along with increased open interest in call options, indicate a favorable outlook for BTC.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the strategic reserve news and maintains bullish technical indicators, suggesting a strong buy signal.

SOL: +0.6 — The inclusion in the strategic reserve and consistent bullish momentum support a positive allocation, though slightly less than BTC and ETH due to lower market cap and liquidity.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, DOGE remains neutral, lacking clear direction for capital allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases due to bullish sentiment in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely, warranting a reduction in exposure."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, primarily driven by the recent announcement of a U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL, leading to significant price surges for these assets. This development has sparked renewed bullish sentiment, as evidenced by increased open interest in BTC call options and positive momentum signals across these assets. However, recent price retracements indicate some volatility and profit-taking, suggesting that while the long-term outlook may be positive, short-term fluctuations are likely. DOGE and USDT have not been significantly impacted by recent news, with DOGE showing some price volatility and USDT maintaining its role as a stablecoin amidst these market changes.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price retracements, BTC's inclusion in the strategic reserve and increased open interest in call options suggest a positive long-term outlook. However, recent volatility warrants a moderate score.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the strategic reserve supports a positive outlook. The asset shows bullish momentum, but recent price decreases suggest caution.

SOL: +0.5 — SOL benefits from its inclusion in the strategic reserve, with strong bullish momentum and recent price increases. However, the asset's volatility necessitates a balanced approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. Its recent price movements do not warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases due to positive developments in other assets, some capital rotation out of USDT is advisable. However, maintaining a stablecoin reserve is prudent given market volatility."
2025-03-03 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement has led to a notable rally in these assets, although the initial surge has seen some retracement. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, and SOL show bullish momentum, supported by strong on-chain activity and positive trend signals. DOGE and USDT remain relatively stable, with no significant news or technical changes affecting their outlook. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with no extreme volatility, which supports a moderate risk-on approach.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and news sentiment. The inclusion in the strategic reserve proposal boosts long-term confidence, despite recent price retracement.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the strategic reserve news, with bullish momentum and trend signals. The price surge indicates strong market confidence.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from the strategic reserve news and strong technical indicators. The recent price increase suggests continued interest and potential upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or technical changes. The asset remains stable with normal activity levels, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment towards other assets, capital rotation away from stablecoins like USDT is likely."
2025-03-03 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

This announcement led to a significant price surge in these assets, although some of the gains have retraced. Technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and SOL show bullish momentum, with short-term moving averages above long-term ones, suggesting continued positive sentiment. DOGE and USDT have not been significantly impacted by recent news, and their technical indicators remain neutral or bearish.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and recent news about inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve plan. The surge in call options also indicates bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the reserve announcement, with strong technical indicators supporting a bullish outlook.

SOL: +0.6 — Positive sentiment from the reserve news and bullish technical indicators suggest a favorable outlook, though slightly less strong than BTC and ETH.

DOGE: 0.0 — No significant news or changes in technical indicators. Maintaining a neutral stance given the lack of new developments.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases due to bullish sentiment in other assets, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2025-03-03 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent bullish news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement has led to significant price surges across these assets, indicating renewed investor confidence and potential upside momentum. However, the broader macroeconomic environment remains mixed, with high volatility in traditional markets and stablecoin USDT showing signs of a potential breakdown, suggesting some caution is warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The inclusion in the proposed crypto reserve and bullish sentiment from options markets support a positive outlook. However, some caution is warranted due to recent retracement after the initial rally.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the reserve news, though recent technical indicators show mixed momentum. The overall sentiment remains positive, but slightly less so than BTC.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's inclusion in the reserve initiative has driven a strong price rally, and technical indicators remain supportive. However, the lack of additional news suggests a moderate approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, DOGE remains neutral. Its price movements have been relatively stable compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases following the reserve news, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets. However, maintaining some USDT is prudent given the mixed macroeconomic signals."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by significant news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement has led to a notable price surge across these assets, reflecting renewed investor confidence and bullish sentiment. However, the initial rally has seen some retracement, indicating potential profit-taking or cautious optimism. Meanwhile, DOGE and USDT remain relatively stable, with no significant news or market shifts impacting their positions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The announcement of BTC's inclusion in the strategic reserve has sparked bullish sentiment, supported by strong technical indicators and increased on-chain activity. This makes BTC an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.7 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the strategic reserve has driven a price surge. Despite mixed momentum signals, the overall sentiment remains positive, warranting increased exposure.

SOL: +0.6 — SOL's price has also benefitted from the strategic reserve news, with technical indicators supporting a buy signal. The positive sentiment and recent price action justify a favorable allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to alter its allocation at this time.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across BTC, ETH, and SOL, there is a strategic opportunity to rotate some capital out of USDT and into these more promising assets."
2025-03-03 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of former President Trump's proposal to include BTC, ETH, and SOL in a ""Crypto Strategic Reserve."" This announcement led to a temporary surge in prices for these assets, although the gains have since retraced. Technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and SOL show buy signals, but recent price declines suggest some market hesitation. DOGE and USDT remain relatively unaffected by the news, with DOGE lacking significant news catalysts and USDT maintaining its role as a stablecoin amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price declines, BTC shows strong buy signals in technical indicators and increased on-chain activity. The strategic reserve news adds a bullish undertone.

ETH: +0.4 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the strategic reserve news and maintains a buy signal in trend indicators, though recent price declines warrant caution.

SOL: +0.3 — SOL's inclusion in the strategic reserve is positive, but recent price volatility suggests a more measured approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral in the current market context.

USDT: -0.3 — As risk appetite increases due to positive news for other assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is justified to reallocate capital towards more promising opportunities."
2025-03-03 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This announcement has led to significant price surges in these assets, reflecting renewed bullish sentiment. However, the market remains volatile, with mixed technical signals and a lack of strong momentum indicators. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by high volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a cautious approach, with potential for further upside in crypto assets if positive sentiment persists.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin has shown resilience with a strong buy signal from the short MA, supported by bullish news regarding its inclusion in the strategic reserve. However, the lack of a clear momentum signal tempers the enthusiasm slightly.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, Ethereum benefits from the strategic reserve news, which has driven a significant price increase. The technical indicators remain neutral, but the news provides a positive backdrop.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's inclusion in the strategic reserve has led to a notable price spike. While technical indicators are neutral, the news-driven rally supports a positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, Dogecoin remains neutral. Its recent price movements do not warrant a change in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment around major cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to reduce USDT holdings in favor of more volatile assets that may benefit from the current bullish sentiment."
2025-03-03 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This announcement led to significant price rallies for these assets, though some of the gains have retraced. Despite the positive news, technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE suggest a lack of strong bullish momentum, as MACD signals remain below their respective signal lines. The macroeconomic context shows moderate volatility and a stable U.S. Dollar Index, which may support a balanced risk approach. Given the recent price volatility and mixed technical signals, a cautious yet opportunistic allocation strategy is warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve plan and increased open interest in call options indicate bullish sentiment. However, recent price retracement and lack of strong momentum signals suggest a moderate buy stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the reserve news, supporting a positive outlook. The absence of additional bullish signals tempers enthusiasm, warranting a moderate buy signal.

SOL: +0.5 — The reserve news has positively impacted SOL, aligning with its recent price spike. Despite the lack of strong momentum signals, the news supports a moderate buy stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. The absence of holdings also suggests no immediate action.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment around other assets and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by significant news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement led to a temporary price surge across these assets, indicating renewed bullish sentiment. However, the technical indicators and recent price movements suggest a mixed picture, with short-term fluctuations and no clear momentum signals. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment, with no extreme volatility or major disruptions in traditional financial markets, which supports a moderate risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price fluctuations, the news of BTC's inclusion in a strategic reserve has bolstered market confidence. The buy signal from the short MA and increased on-chain activity support a positive outlook.

ETH: +0.4 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the strategic reserve news. However, the lack of additional bullish technical signals tempers the enthusiasm slightly compared to BTC.

SOL: +0.3 — SOL's inclusion in the strategic reserve initiative provides a positive sentiment boost. However, the technical indicators do not show strong momentum, warranting a more cautious approach.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. The lack of recent developments suggests maintaining the current stance.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the optimistic sentiment around major cryptocurrencies, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-03-03 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a proposed U.S. crypto reserve that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This announcement has led to significant short-term rallies in these assets, although the initial excitement has somewhat retraced. Technical indicators across BTC, ETH, and SOL show buy signals from short-term moving averages, but momentum indicators remain subdued, suggesting a need for cautious optimism. DOGE and USDT have not seen significant news or technical shifts, indicating a more stable outlook for these assets. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and increased volatility, suggests a mixed backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite retracement, BTC remains supported by positive news and buy signals from short-term moving averages. Increased on-chain activity further supports a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve plan. However, technical indicators are less supportive, warranting a slightly lower score.

SOL: +0.5 — SOL's inclusion in the reserve initiative has boosted sentiment, but like ETH, technicals are not as strong, justifying a moderate positive score.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical developments, DOGE remains neutral. The lack of movement suggests holding current positions.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive sentiment and potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on bullish opportunities in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-03-03 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by significant developments such as the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement has led to a notable price surge for these assets, reflecting renewed bullish sentiment. However, the market remains volatile, with technical indicators showing mixed signals across the board. BTC and ETH have seen increased interest in call options, suggesting growing confidence in potential upside moves. Despite the positive news, the broader macroeconomic context remains challenging, with high volatility and mixed signals from traditional markets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The announcement of BTC's inclusion in the strategic reserve has sparked bullish sentiment, supported by increased on-chain activity and interest in call options. However, mixed technical signals warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the strategic reserve news, with a significant price surge. The lack of additional news and mixed technical signals suggest a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — The strategic reserve news has positively impacted SOL, resulting in a price spike. While technical indicators are mixed, the news provides a supportive backdrop for a moderate positive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or major changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. The absence of strategic reserve inclusion keeps sentiment flat.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive news for BTC, ETH, and SOL, there is a slight rotation out of stablecoins like USDT as risk appetite increases. However, macroeconomic uncertainty keeps the reduction moderate."
2025-03-03 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is moderately bullish, driven by significant news regarding the inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump. This announcement has sparked notable price rallies across these assets, with BTC, ETH, and SOL showing strong upward price movements. Despite this bullish sentiment, technical indicators remain mixed, with BTC showing a buy signal on trend but lacking momentum confirmation. The macroeconomic backdrop, with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility, suggests cautious optimism. There is no significant news or technical signals for DOGE or USDT, maintaining their neutral stance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The strategic reserve news has provided a strong bullish catalyst, supported by a buy trend signal. However, the lack of momentum confirmation tempers the score slightly.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the reserve news and a significant price increase, though technicals remain neutral, justifying a moderate positive score.

SOL: +0.5 — SOL's inclusion in the reserve plan has driven a strong price rally. Despite neutral technicals, the news supports a positive outlook.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. Current market conditions do not favor a shift in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment and price rallies in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic following the announcement of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" by former President Trump, which includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This news has led to significant price surges across these assets, reflecting renewed bullish sentiment. However, technical indicators for most assets remain mixed, with no strong buy signals from momentum indicators. The macroeconomic context, with stable interest rates and a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets, but the recent news has injected a degree of optimism into the market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The inclusion in the proposed strategic reserve and the surge in $100K call options suggest strong bullish sentiment. However, mixed technical indicators warrant a moderate score.

ETH: +0.5 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the reserve plan has boosted sentiment, though technicals remain neutral. The recent price surge supports a positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's inclusion in the strategic reserve has led to a significant price increase. Despite mixed technicals, the news supports a moderately bullish stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. The lack of portfolio exposure also suggests no immediate action.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the bullish sentiment from the reserve news, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins and into riskier assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL."
2025-03-03 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently cautious with a mix of bullish and bearish signals. Recent macroeconomic indicators suggest a relatively stable environment, though the elevated VIX indicates potential market volatility. The significant price retracement across BTC, ETH, and SOL after an initial surge due to Trump's announcement of a ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" highlights the market's sensitivity to news-driven events. Despite the initial bullish sentiment, technical indicators and recent price actions suggest a lack of sustained momentum, with most assets experiencing a significant pullback in the last hour. The absence of major news for DOGE and USDT indicates a more stable outlook for these assets, with USDT remaining a safe haven amid market uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price drop, the inclusion in the strategic reserve and increased call options interest suggest potential for recovery. However, technical indicators remain mixed.

ETH: +0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the reserve plan is positive, but the recent price drop and lack of additional bullish signals warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: +0.1 — The strategic reserve news provides a positive backdrop, but the significant recent price drop and lack of technical buy signals suggest limited immediate upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, DOGE remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the recent volatility and price drops in other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-03-03 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by recent macroeconomic developments and strategic announcements. The inclusion of BTC, ETH, and SOL in a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" has sparked significant interest, leading to notable price surges for these assets. However, these rallies have seen some retracement, suggesting a mixed sentiment with potential for further volatility. The macroeconomic backdrop, including stable interest rates and a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets, with volatility remaining a concern as indicated by the VIX.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price retracement, BTC's inclusion in the strategic reserve and increased on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook. However, the lack of a clear momentum signal tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.3 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from strategic reserve inclusion, but lacks additional bullish signals. The recent price surge provides a moderate positive bias.

SOL: +0.4 — SOL's significant price increase and strategic reserve inclusion support a positive allocation, though technical indicators remain neutral.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. The absence of holdings also limits the potential for a negative score.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the bullish sentiment around major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential upside in risk assets."
2025-03-03 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by the recent announcement of a U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" including BTC, ETH, and SOL. This news has led to significant price surges in these assets, although some retracement has occurred. Despite the positive news, technical indicators remain mixed, with most assets showing no clear buy signals based on short-term moving averages and MACD. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a balanced approach to risk. In this environment, maintaining a diversified portfolio with a slight tilt towards assets benefiting from the reserve announcement, while keeping a stable USDT position for risk management, seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve and increased open interest in call options suggest bullish sentiment, though technicals are mixed. A moderate increase in allocation is justified.

ETH: +0.4 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the reserve news, but lacks additional bullish signals from technical indicators. A cautious increase is warranted.

SOL: +0.3 — The reserve announcement has positively impacted SOL, but without strong technical support, a modest increase is advisable.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, maintaining a neutral stance on DOGE is appropriate.

USDT: -0.2 — Given the positive sentiment around BTC, ETH, and SOL, a slight reduction in USDT holdings is reasonable to capitalize on potential gains in these assets."

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by recent news of a proposed U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This announcement initially led to significant price surges across these assets, though some of these gains have since retraced. Despite this, the inclusion in the reserve has sparked renewed bullish sentiment, particularly reflected in the increase of $100K BTC call options. However, technical indicators across the board remain bearish, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals not yet turning bullish. The macroeconomic context shows a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, suggesting a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Despite bearish technicals, the strategic reserve news and increased call option activity suggest potential upside. Maintain moderate exposure to capitalize on potential bullish sentiment.

**ETH: +0.4** — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the reserve supports a positive outlook, but technicals remain weak. A moderate increase in allocation is justified by the news-driven sentiment.

**SOL: +0.3** — The news of inclusion in the reserve has positively impacted SOL, but recent price volatility suggests a cautious approach. A slight increase in allocation is warranted.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With no significant news or technical signals, maintain a neutral stance. Current market conditions do not justify a change in allocation.

**USDT: -0.3** — Given the potential for bullish sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is reasonable to reallocate capital towards riskier assets."
2025-03-03 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic following the announcement of a U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). This news has led to significant price spikes in these assets, although recent market data shows a retracement in prices. Despite the initial bullish reaction, technical indicators across BTC, ETH, and SOL remain bearish, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals indicating no bullish momentum. The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with no extreme volatility in traditional markets, but the U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could exert downward pressure on crypto prices. In this context, maintaining a balanced approach with a slight preference for risk assets seems prudent.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent price retracement, the inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve and increased open interest in call options suggest potential for future upside. However, technical indicators remain bearish, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the reserve plan provides a bullish narrative. However, technicals are not supportive of a strong buy signal, so a moderate positive score is appropriate.

SOL: +0.3 — The news of SOL's inclusion in the reserve initiative has led to a price spike, but technical indicators do not confirm a strong buy signal. A moderate positive score reflects the potential for further gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. The absence of a strong narrative or technical support suggests holding the current position.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the recent bullish news for other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate some capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in BTC, ETH, and SOL. However, maintaining a substantial USDT position is prudent given the lack of clear bullish technicals across other assets."
2025-03-03 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE over the past few hours. Despite recent positive news about their inclusion in a proposed U.S. crypto reserve, the market has not sustained the initial rally, and technical indicators remain weak with no buy signals. On-chain activity for BTC and ETH shows increased transactions, suggesting some market interest, but this has not translated into upward price momentum. The macroeconomic context, with high volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, further supports a cautious approach, potentially favoring stablecoins like USDT in the short term.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the initial bullish news, BTC has experienced significant price declines and remains below key technical levels, suggesting a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH's price has dropped significantly, and technical indicators do not support a buy. The news impact has faded, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — SOL has faced the steepest decline among the assets, and with no additional supportive news, a reduction in exposure is prudent.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral in terms of allocation.

USDT: +0.8 — Given the bearish sentiment and high market volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is advisable to preserve capital and wait for clearer market signals."
2025-03-03 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic following the announcement of a U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This news has sparked significant price rallies in these assets, although the gains were partially retraced. Despite the positive news, technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE remain bearish, with prices below key moving averages and momentum signals indicating potential further downside. The macroeconomic context, with a high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets. In this context, USDT remains a stable option for preserving capital amid uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — The inclusion in the strategic reserve is a bullish development, but technical indicators remain weak. A moderate buy signal reflects the potential for upside if sentiment improves.

ETH: +0.3 — Similar to BTC, the strategic reserve news is positive, but technicals are not supportive. A cautious buy signal is warranted given the potential for further gains if sentiment shifts.

SOL: +0.3 — The strategic reserve news provides a positive backdrop, but technical indicators are bearish. A moderate buy signal is appropriate given the potential for sentiment-driven gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical improvements, DOGE remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to allocate capital here at this time.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish technicals across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation is prudent for capital preservation."
2025-03-03 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a recent surge in activity and price due to the announcement of a U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This news initially drove significant price rallies in these assets, but the gains have since retraced, indicating a volatile environment. Despite the initial bullish sentiment, technical indicators across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE remain bearish, with prices below key moving averages and momentum signals not yet turning positive. The macroeconomic context, with a high VIX and a strong U.S. dollar, suggests a risk-off environment, which typically favors stable assets like USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While technicals remain bearish, the inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve and increased on-chain activity suggest potential for recovery. The market is showing some renewed interest, but caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

ETH: +0.2 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the reserve news, but technical indicators are still weak. The slight positive score reflects potential upside but with a need for confirmation from technicals.

SOL: +0.2 — SOL's inclusion in the reserve initiative provides a bullish backdrop, yet like ETH and BTC, technical indicators remain bearish. The score reflects cautious optimism pending further positive signals.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or positive technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral. The absence of major developments keeps it sidelined in the current market context.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the risk-off sentiment and macroeconomic indicators, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent. It provides stability amidst market volatility and retracement in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by recent announcements of a U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL, sparking significant short-term rallies in these assets. However, the market remains volatile with mixed technical signals, as evidenced by the recent price fluctuations and the lack of clear trend signals across the board. Despite the positive news, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, with high volatility and no clear bullish momentum in technical indicators, suggesting a need for cautious capital allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The announcement of BTC's inclusion in the strategic reserve has sparked renewed interest and bullish sentiment, although technical indicators remain mixed. The overall macro environment suggests a cautious but positive outlook.

ETH: +0.4 — Similar to BTC, ETH's inclusion in the strategic reserve has led to a price surge. However, technical indicators are not yet fully supportive, warranting a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — SOL's price has benefited from the strategic reserve news, but like ETH, technical signals are not yet strong enough to justify a more aggressive allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or strong technical signals, DOGE remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the recent positive news for BTC, ETH, and SOL, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of these assets, reflecting a cautious increase in risk appetite."
2025-03-03 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by the recent announcement of a U.S. ""Crypto Strategic Reserve"" that includes BTC, ETH, and SOL. This news has spurred significant price rallies across these assets, although some of the gains have retraced. Despite the positive news, technical indicators for BTC, ETH, and SOL remain bearish, with short-term moving averages below long-term ones and MACD signals not showing bullish momentum. DOGE and USDT have no significant news, and their market data suggest a lack of strong directional movement. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets, which may lead to cautious capital allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — The inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve is a positive development, but technical indicators remain bearish. A moderate increase in allocation is justified by the news-driven sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Similar to BTC, ETH benefits from the reserve inclusion news. However, technicals are not supportive of a strong buy signal, warranting a cautious increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.3 — SOL's inclusion in the reserve initiative is a positive catalyst, but technical indicators are not yet supportive of a strong upward move. A moderate allocation increase is appropriate.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical signals, DOGE remains neutral. There is no compelling reason to adjust exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the recent positive news for BTC, ETH, and SOL, and the lack of strong bearish signals, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to allocate more capital to the other assets."
2025-03-04 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a volatile session, initially dropping significantly before rebounding, indicating some resilience despite recent selling pressure. Ethereum is facing challenges near its $2,000 support level, with concerns over ETF-related outflows and potential liquidation risks. Solana has been hit hard by a substantial price drop, exacerbated by concerns over large unstaking events. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below key support levels and forming bearish patterns. Meanwhile, Tether is facing regulatory challenges in Europe, impacting its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests some underlying strength. However, caution is warranted given the lack of strong technical buy signals.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure near critical support levels, with liquidation risks and ETF outflows contributing to a bearish outlook.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price decline and concerns over large unstaking events suggest potential further downside, warranting reduced exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bearish technical setup, maintaining a neutral stance is prudent.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a defensive position."
2025-03-04 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and mixed sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline to $83k but has shown resilience with a quick rebound, indicating some underlying support. Ethereum is facing pressure near the $2,000 support level, with significant outflows and liquidation risks adding to the bearish sentiment. Solana has been hit hard by a strategic reserve announcement and concerns over a large unstaking event, leading to a significant price drop. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish wedge pattern. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, with Binance delisting it for European users.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's quick recovery suggests some support. However, the lack of strong technical buy signals warrants a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure with significant outflows and liquidation risks. The bearish sentiment around the $2,000 support level suggests reducing exposure.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's sharp decline due to unstaking concerns and strategic reserve issues indicates a bearish outlook. Reducing exposure is prudent given the potential for further downside.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's break below $0.20 and forming wedge pattern suggest downside risk, but without current holdings, maintaining a neutral stance is appropriate.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the overall market volatility and bearish sentiment in other assets, maintaining a higher exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity advantage."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a general bearish sentiment, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop to $83k but showed some recovery, indicating potential volatility. Ethereum is testing a critical support level at $2,000, with ETF-related outflows adding pressure. Solana faced a steep decline due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, while Dogecoin broke below $0.20, forming a bearish wedge pattern. Meanwhile, Tether's delisting in Europe by Binance highlights regulatory challenges for stablecoins. Given the high volatility and bearish signals, a cautious approach with a focus on capital preservation is advisable.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight recovery, BTC remains under pressure with bearish technical indicators and low on-chain activity, suggesting a cautious stance.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is nearing a critical support level with significant outflows and liquidation risks, warranting a reduction in exposure.

SOL: -0.5 — The recent sharp decline and unstaking concerns indicate potential further downside, making it prudent to reduce holdings.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no current holdings and a bearish technical pattern, there is no incentive to initiate a position in DOGE at this time.

USDT: +0.6 — In a volatile and bearish market, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-03-04 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bearish, with significant price declines observed across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop to $83k before a modest recovery, while Ethereum is testing critical support levels amid ETF-related outflows. Solana faced a substantial crash due to strategic reserve announcements and concerns over a large unstaking event. Dogecoin has broken below a key price level, forming a bearish pattern. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable but faces regulatory challenges in Europe, as evidenced by Binance's decision to delist USDT for European users. In this environment, risk aversion is evident, and a cautious approach with a preference for stable assets like USDT is warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite a slight recovery, Bitcoin's recent volatility and lack of bullish technical signals suggest caution. The macroeconomic environment and recent heavy selling pressure warrant a reduced exposure.

ETH: -0.4 — Ethereum is facing significant sell pressure and is near critical support levels, with no bullish momentum. The risk of further downside amid ETF-related outflows suggests reducing exposure.

SOL: -0.5 — Solana's sharp decline and concerns over large unstaking events indicate potential for further downside. The lack of positive technical signals supports a cautious stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — Although DOGE has broken below a key level, the absence of a current holding and the lack of significant positive catalysts suggest a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent. The regulatory challenges in Europe are a concern but do not outweigh the need for stability in the current market conditions."
2025-03-04 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautious, with significant volatility observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop to $83k but showed resilience by rebounding above $88k, indicating some recovery potential. Ethereum is testing its $2,000 support level amidst ETF-related outflows, suggesting vulnerability but no immediate liquidation risk. Solana faced a steep decline due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, highlighting potential downside risks. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish wedge pattern. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, impacting its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests some resilience. However, caution is warranted due to the lack of strong bullish signals.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is hovering near key support levels with mixed sentiment. The absence of strong bullish indicators suggests a neutral stance.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's sharp decline and unstaking concerns present downside risks. The lack of positive momentum signals further caution.

DOGE: 0.0 — Dogecoin's technical breakdown and lack of positive news warrant a neutral position, especially given no current holdings.

USDT: +0.5 — With market volatility and regulatory challenges, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2025-03-04 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a recent recovery in prices following earlier sell-offs. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience, bouncing back from significant drops, although technical indicators remain mixed with no clear buy signals. Solana faces pressure from strategic reserve announcements and large unstaking events, leading to volatility and potential support challenges. Dogecoin is experiencing technical breakdowns, with a falling wedge pattern suggesting further downside risk. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, but its stable nature continues to attract capital in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's recovery from a significant dip and its role as a market leader justify a moderate positive allocation, though technical indicators remain cautious.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum's proximity to key support levels and mixed news sentiment suggest a neutral stance, as recent volatility and liquidation risks temper enthusiasm.

SOL: -0.2 — The recent crash and concerns over large unstaking events warrant a cautious approach, despite potential support levels; current holdings should be slightly reduced.

DOGE: +0.1 — Although technical indicators suggest downside risk, recent activity surges and the potential for a technical rebound justify a small positive allocation.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed market conditions and regulatory challenges in Europe, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against volatility, supporting capital preservation."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautious with mixed signals across the board. Bitcoin has experienced volatility with a recent dip followed by a recovery, indicating uncertainty but potential resilience. Ethereum is testing critical support levels amid ETF-related outflows, suggesting vulnerability to further declines. Solana has seen significant price drops due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, highlighting potential instability. Dogecoin is facing downside risks as it breaks below key levels, while Tether is dealing with regulatory challenges in Europe. Overall, the market is showing signs of risk aversion, with potential for further volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests some resilience. However, the lack of strong bullish signals keeps the score modest.

ETH: -0.3 — Ethereum is under pressure from ETF-related outflows and is near critical support levels, indicating potential for further downside.

SOL: -0.4 — Significant price drops and unstaking concerns create a bearish outlook, warranting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.5 — Breaking below key levels and forming a bearish pattern suggests further downside risk, justifying a reduction in holdings.

USDT: +0.6 — In light of market volatility and risk aversion, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent, despite regulatory challenges in Europe."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed, with a recent recovery in Bitcoin following a sharp decline, while Ethereum is testing key support levels amid ETF-related outflows. Solana has experienced significant volatility due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, which may lead to further downside. Dogecoin is facing technical challenges with a potential wedge breakdown, while Tether is under regulatory pressure in Europe. The macroeconomic environment shows elevated volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could influence risk-averse behavior in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin has shown resilience with a recovery from its lows. However, the lack of strong technical buy signals suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is under pressure near support levels with significant ETF-related outflows, leading to a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.2 — The recent crash and unstaking concerns create downside risk, warranting a reduction in exposure given current holdings.

DOGE: -0.3 — Technical patterns indicate potential further declines, and recent news has not been supportive, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.2 — With regulatory challenges in Europe, maintaining some exposure to USDT is prudent for stability amid market uncertainty, but the overall risk environment suggests a slight increase in allocation."
2025-03-04 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a slight recovery observed across major cryptocurrencies after recent sell-offs. Bitcoin experienced a quick rebound after a significant dip, indicating potential resilience, while Ethereum is testing critical support levels amid ETF-related outflows. Solana faced a substantial crash due to unstaking concerns, yet analysts suggest possible support levels may prevent further declines. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below key levels and forming a bearish pattern. Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, leading to its delisting on Binance, which may affect its stability in the region. The macroeconomic context shows moderate volatility and a strong U.S. dollar, which could influence risk asset allocations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's quick recovery and overall market resilience suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a moderate score.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing mixed signals with critical support levels being tested and significant liquidation risks averted. The sentiment remains neutral as technicals do not strongly favor either direction.

SOL: -0.2 — Solana's recent crash and unstaking concerns create downside risks, despite potential support levels. Current holdings should be cautiously maintained without increasing exposure.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin's bearish technical pattern and recent price decline below key levels suggest reducing exposure, given the lack of positive catalysts.

USDT: +0.2 — With ongoing market volatility and regulatory challenges, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a hedge against potential downside risks in other assets."
2025-03-04 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious, with significant volatility and mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop but showed resilience by rebounding, indicating some underlying support despite the lack of bullish technical signals. Ethereum is testing critical support levels, with recent volatility raising concerns about potential liquidations, although it avoided major risks. Solana faced a substantial decline due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, suggesting potential further downside. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking key support levels and forming bearish patterns. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, but regulatory challenges in Europe could impact its liquidity and usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests some underlying support. However, technical indicators remain neutral, warranting a cautious approach.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum is near critical support levels, with mixed technical signals and recent sell pressure. The potential for further downside exists, but the avoidance of major liquidation risks provides some stability.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's recent sharp decline and unstaking concerns indicate potential for further downside. The lack of bullish technical signals suggests a cautious stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's break below key support levels and bearish wedge pattern suggest downside risk. The lack of positive catalysts warrants a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of market volatility and bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a safer position amid uncertainty."
2025-03-04 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current crypto market is experiencing mixed sentiment, with some assets showing signs of recovery while others face downward pressure. Bitcoin has shown resilience, rebounding from a recent dip, but remains under pressure from heavy selling. Ethereum is testing key support levels amid ETF-related outflows, avoiding major liquidation risks. Solana has experienced significant volatility, with a recent crash following a strategic reserve announcement and concerns over large unstaking events. Dogecoin is facing downside risk after breaking below $0.20, with technical patterns suggesting further declines. Meanwhile, Tether is facing regulatory challenges in Europe, leading to its delisting on Binance, which could impact its stability and usage.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound from a significant dip suggests some resilience. However, the lack of clear bullish signals and ongoing selling pressure warrant a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.1 — Ethereum is holding above key support levels and avoiding major liquidation risks, but ETF-related outflows and mixed technical signals suggest limited upside potential in the short term.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's recent crash and concerns over large unstaking events create significant downside risk, despite some analysts expecting support near $128. Current holdings should be reduced cautiously.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's break below $0.20 and the formation of a falling-wedge pattern indicate potential further declines. Reducing exposure is prudent given the downside risk.

USDT: +0.4 — With market volatility and regulatory challenges affecting other assets, maintaining a higher USDT exposure provides stability and flexibility for future capital rotation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed, with some assets showing signs of recovery while others face downward pressure. Bitcoin experienced a bounce back after a significant drop, indicating potential resilience, but still faces volatility. Ethereum is testing key support levels amid ETF-related outflows, suggesting cautious optimism. Solana has been hit hard by a strategic reserve announcement and unstaking concerns, leading to a sharp decline. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below key support levels and forming a bearish pattern. Meanwhile, Tether's delisting in Europe by Binance adds regulatory uncertainty to the stablecoin market, but it remains a safe haven in volatile conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.3** — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin shows signs of recovery and resilience. The news of a bounce back after a dip suggests potential for upward movement, though caution is warranted given the recent heavy selling.

**ETH: +0.2** — Ethereum is holding above the $2,000 support level, and the avoidance of a major liquidation event is a positive sign. However, ETF-related outflows remain a concern, warranting a cautious but slightly positive outlook.

**SOL: -0.5** — Solana faces significant downward pressure due to unstaking concerns and a sharp price drop. The potential for further decline towards $100 suggests reducing exposure.

**DOGE: -0.3** — Dogecoin's break below $0.20 and the formation of a bearish wedge pattern indicate downside risk. Given the current holdings, reducing exposure is prudent.

**USDT: +0.3** — In light of market volatility and regulatory concerns, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a safe haven. Despite the Binance delisting in Europe, USDT remains a stable asset in uncertain conditions."
2025-03-04 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and a moderate level of volatility, which suggests a cautious market sentiment. Bitcoin has experienced significant volatility, with a recent bounce after a sharp sell-off, indicating mixed sentiment. Ethereum is testing key support levels, with liquidation risks narrowly avoided, while Solana faces pressure from a large unstaking event and recent price crashes. Dogecoin is under pressure from technical breakdowns and negative news, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, impacting its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, BTC shows signs of recovery and resilience, making it relatively attractive in a cautious market environment.

ETH: +0.1 — Ethereum's technical indicators are positive, but the recent test of support and ETF-related outflows warrant a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and concerns over large unstaking events create downside risk, suggesting a reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.5 — Technical breakdown and negative news sentiment indicate potential further downside, justifying a reduction in holdings.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market uncertainty and volatility, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer and liquidity for potential opportunities."
2025-03-04 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by volatility and mixed sentiment across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced significant price fluctuations, with a recent dip to $83k followed by a rebound, indicating a volatile trading environment. Ethereum is facing pressure near the $2,000 support level due to ETF-related outflows, although it avoided a major liquidation event. Solana has faced a sharp decline due to concerns over a large unstaking event, while Dogecoin is under pressure after breaking below $0.20, forming a bearish pattern. Tether's removal from Binance in Europe reflects regulatory challenges, but it remains stable in price. Overall, the market shows signs of caution, with potential for further downside risk, particularly in assets like SOL and DOGE.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin shows resilience with a rebound from its lows. However, the lack of strong technical buy signals suggests a cautious approach.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is under pressure near key support levels, with mixed sentiment due to ETF-related outflows. The avoidance of a major liquidation is a positive, but caution is warranted.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price decline and concerns over large unstaking events suggest potential for further downside. Current holdings should be reduced.

DOGE: -0.4 — Breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish wedge pattern indicates downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent given current market conditions.

USDT: +0.5 — In a volatile market, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a hedge against downside risk and allows for flexibility in capital deployment."
2025-03-04 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced significant volatility, with a sharp drop followed by a recovery, indicating uncertain sentiment. Ethereum is testing key support levels amid ETF-related outflows, suggesting caution. Solana has faced a substantial decline due to unstaking concerns, though some analysts expect support at lower levels. Dogecoin has broken below a critical price level, forming a bearish pattern. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, impacting its stability. Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious, with a tendency towards risk aversion, as evidenced by the volatility and recent sell-offs.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's recovery and bullish momentum signal suggest a cautious buy, but the overall market uncertainty tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: -0.1 — Ethereum faces pressure from ETF-related outflows and is near key support levels, indicating a slight reduction in exposure until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and unstaking concerns create downside risk, warranting a reduction in exposure despite potential support at lower levels.

DOGE: -0.2 — Breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish pattern suggests further downside risk, justifying a cautious reduction in holdings.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the overall market caution and volatility, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure is prudent, despite regulatory challenges in Europe."

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin has shown some resilience, bouncing back after a significant drop, but remains under pressure from heavy selling. Ethereum is testing critical support levels, with recent volatility raising concerns about potential liquidations. Solana has experienced a sharp decline due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking fears, though some analysts see possible support levels. Dogecoin has broken below a key price level, forming a bearish pattern, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious, with investors showing a preference for stability amid recent volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound suggests some resilience. However, caution is warranted due to heavy selling pressures.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is at a critical support level with mixed signals from recent sell-offs and potential liquidation risks. Neutral stance until clearer direction emerges.

SOL: -0.3 — Significant price drop and concerns over large unstaking events suggest potential for further downside. Reduce exposure to manage risk.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent breakdown below $0.20 and formation of a bearish wedge pattern indicate downside risk. Reduce exposure but monitor for potential support.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and regulatory challenges, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a safety net for potential capital rotation."
2025-03-04 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed with signs of recovery following recent declines. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop but showed resilience by bouncing back, indicating potential support levels. Ethereum is facing pressure near the $2,000 mark due to ETF-related outflows, although it avoided a major liquidation event. Solana's significant drop is concerning, driven by strategic reserve announcements and unstaking fears, yet some analysts see potential support. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below key levels and forming a bearish pattern. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, which could impact its demand.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's ability to rebound from lows suggests underlying strength. Positive momentum signals and on-chain activity support a moderate buy stance.

ETH: 0.0 — Ethereum is facing mixed signals with pressure near key support levels and ETF-related outflows. The avoidance of a major liquidation provides some stability, warranting a neutral position.

SOL: -0.3 — Solana's significant drop and concerns over unstaking create a bearish outlook. While some support is expected, the risk of further declines suggests reducing exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's break below $0.20 and formation of a falling-wedge pattern indicate downside risk. Reducing exposure is prudent given the bearish technical setup.

USDT: +0.2 — With market volatility and regulatory challenges, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a hedge against potential downside in riskier assets."
2025-03-04 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with recent price recoveries in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, despite earlier sell-offs. Bitcoin has shown resilience, bouncing back from a dip to $83k, suggesting underlying bullish momentum. Ethereum is holding above the critical $2,000 support level, avoiding major liquidation risks. Solana, however, faces volatility due to strategic reserve announcements and unstaking concerns, though it has shown some recovery. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below $0.20 with technical patterns indicating potential further downside. Meanwhile, USDT faces regulatory challenges in Europe, impacting its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's quick recovery and strong on-chain activity suggest a bullish outlook. The macroeconomic context with a high S&P 500 and stable gold prices supports risk-on sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's resilience above $2,000 and avoidance of major liquidation provide a positive signal, though ETF-related outflows are a concern.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's recent price recovery is tempered by unstaking concerns and potential sell-off risks. The market remains uncertain, warranting a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin's technical breakdown below $0.20 and potential further downside suggest reducing exposure, especially given the lack of positive catalysts.

USDT: -0.5 — With regulatory challenges in Europe and a general market recovery, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely as risk appetite increases."
2025-03-04 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant price recoveries observed in major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE after recent sell-offs. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly from its dip, and Ethereum has managed to avoid major liquidation risks despite ETF-related outflows. Solana experienced a sharp drop due to unstaking concerns but has shown signs of stabilization. Dogecoin is facing technical challenges with a potential downside risk, while Tether faces regulatory pressures in Europe. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by a high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility, suggests a mixed backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and bullish momentum indicate a favorable environment for further gains, despite recent volatility. The macro context supports a cautious but positive outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's resilience in avoiding major liquidation and maintaining support above $2,000, combined with bullish momentum, warrants a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility and unstaking concerns, Solana's recovery and strategic reserve inclusion provide a cautiously optimistic outlook, though risks remain.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin's technical challenges and recent price pattern suggest caution, but given current holdings, a slight reduction is prudent.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing signs of recovery, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable to reallocate capital towards riskier assets with higher potential returns."
2025-03-04 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant price recoveries observed across major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after a sharp dip, indicating a potential recovery phase. Ethereum is holding above key support levels despite recent volatility and liquidation risks. Solana has faced significant selling pressure due to unstaking concerns, but it is showing signs of stabilization. Dogecoin has broken below a key level, forming a bearish pattern, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe. The macroeconomic context, with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets, but the recent bullish momentum in crypto markets indicates a potential shift towards risk-on sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong recovery from recent lows and bullish momentum signals suggest a favorable environment for further gains, supported by increased on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Ethereum's resilience above the $2,000 support level and positive momentum indicators warrant a moderately bullish stance.

SOL: +0.3 — While Solana has faced significant selling pressure, the stabilization above $140 and potential support at $128 provide a cautiously optimistic outlook.

DOGE: -0.2 — Dogecoin's breakdown below $0.20 and bearish wedge pattern indicate potential downside risk, justifying a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — With the broader market showing signs of recovery and risk appetite increasing, reducing stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets is prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of recovery after recent dips. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly from a significant sell-off, and Ethereum has managed to avoid major liquidation risks despite nearing critical support levels. Solana has experienced a sharp decline due to concerns over large unstaking events, but there is potential support at lower levels. Dogecoin is facing technical challenges, with a falling wedge pattern indicating potential further downside. Meanwhile, Tether is facing regulatory challenges in Europe, which could impact its demand in that region.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin shows strong recovery potential and bullish momentum, making it relatively attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's resilience in avoiding major liquidation and maintaining support near $2,000 suggests moderate upside potential.

SOL: -0.2 — The recent sharp decline and concerns over large unstaking events warrant caution, though potential support at lower levels may limit downside.

DOGE: -0.3 — Technical patterns suggest further downside risk, and recent news does not provide a positive catalyst, warranting reduced exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed signals in the broader market and regulatory challenges in Europe, maintaining current stablecoin exposure is prudent."
2025-03-04 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of recovery after recent sell-offs. Bitcoin and Ethereum have rebounded from significant dips, with Bitcoin experiencing a quick bounce back above $88k and Ethereum avoiding a major liquidation risk. Solana, despite a sharp drop due to unstaking concerns, is showing signs of potential support. Dogecoin is facing some downside risk after breaking below $0.20, and Tether is under pressure due to regulatory changes in Europe. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively high volatility index and strong dollar, suggests a mixed backdrop for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Bitcoin's recent rebound and strong on-chain activity suggest a positive outlook, although caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's recovery from a potential liquidation event indicates resilience, but ETF-related outflows remain a concern.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent sell-off pressures, Solana's inclusion in a strategic reserve and potential support levels provide a cautiously optimistic view.

DOGE: -0.2 — With recent technical breakdowns and negative news, Dogecoin faces downside risks, warranting a reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — Given the mixed market signals and regulatory challenges in Europe, maintaining a neutral stance on Tether is prudent to balance risk."
2025-03-04 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most cryptocurrencies showing signs of recovery after recent sell-offs. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly from a dip, indicating resilience and potential for further gains. Ethereum is facing pressure near the $2,000 support level, but significant liquidation risks have been averted, which might stabilize the asset. Solana experienced a sharp decline due to unstaking concerns, but analysts suggest potential support at lower levels. Dogecoin is under pressure after breaking below $0.20, with technical patterns indicating further downside risk. Meanwhile, Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, which could impact its stability and usage in that region.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Bitcoin's strong rebound and positive on-chain activity suggest continued upward momentum, making it an attractive asset for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent volatility, Ethereum's avoidance of major liquidation risks and technical support near $2,000 provide a cautiously optimistic outlook.

SOL: -0.2 — The recent sharp decline and unstaking concerns overshadow any short-term recovery signals, warranting a cautious approach given current holdings.

DOGE: -0.5 — Breaking below key support levels and forming a bearish pattern suggests further downside risk, prompting a reduction in exposure.

USDT: 0.0 — With mixed signals from regulatory news and market conditions, maintaining a neutral stance on USDT is prudent until clearer trends emerge."
2025-03-04 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a recent recovery in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices after significant sell-offs. Bitcoin rebounded from a dip to $83k, indicating resilience, while Ethereum narrowly avoided a major liquidation event, suggesting underlying support. Solana experienced a sharp decline due to strategic reserve announcements and concerns over a large unstaking event, but analysts expect support near $128. Dogecoin is under pressure, breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish wedge pattern, while Tether faces regulatory challenges in Europe, leading to its delisting on Binance.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin shows signs of recovery with strong on-chain activity and a bounce back from its lows, suggesting a cautiously optimistic outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Ethereum's resilience in avoiding a major liquidation and maintaining support near $2,000, along with bullish technical signals, supports a modest positive allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — The sharp decline due to unstaking concerns and strategic reserve announcements suggests caution, though potential support near $128 could stabilize the asset.

DOGE: -0.5 — Breaking below $0.20 and forming a bearish wedge pattern indicates downside risk, warranting a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — Despite regulatory challenges in Europe, maintaining some exposure to USDT provides a hedge against market volatility, though the overall risk appetite is slightly increasing."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news regarding potential U.S. government crypto reserves and tariff delays. Ethereum, while experiencing a recent pullback, remains supported by its stablecoin activity. Solana has shown signs of recovery after a recent crash, with reports highlighting its undervalued DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish setups, suggesting potential for a rebound. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable amidst regulatory clarifications in Europe, though broader market optimism may lead to capital rotation away from stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news developments, including potential U.S. government interest, suggest continued upward momentum.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price weakness, Ethereum's strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support, warranting a cautious positive outlook.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum indicate potential for further gains.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical patterns and ETF optimism suggest a potential rebound, though the overall market position remains speculative.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite across the market, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2025-03-05 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with notable developments across several major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a surge in demand, driven by positive news regarding potential U.S. government interest in crypto reserves and a temporary boost from tariff delay announcements. Ethereum, while facing some bearish sentiment due to price pullback fears, remains supported by strong activity in the stablecoin sector. Solana shows signs of recovery after a recent crash, with reports suggesting its DeFi ecosystem is undervalued compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin has rallied on ETF optimism and technical signals indicating a potential rebound. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with regulatory clarifications ensuring its continued use in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity. The potential for a national crypto reserve adds a significant bullish catalyst.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price weakness, Ethereum's strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support. However, caution is warranted due to pullback fears.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential for further upside. Positive sentiment from network growth supports a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — ETF optimism and technical bullish setups indicate potential for further gains. However, the speculative nature of DOGE warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to reallocate capital towards more promising opportunities."
2025-03-05 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to favorable news about potential U.S. crypto reserve strategies and tariff delays, which have buoyed its price. Ethereum shows signs of weakness, trading near critical support levels, although its stablecoin activity provides some underlying strength. Solana is recovering from a recent crash, with reports suggesting its DeFi ecosystem is undervalued compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is experiencing a positive sentiment shift due to ETF optimism and technical bullish setups. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarifications supporting its continued use in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by macroeconomic news and technical indicators. The potential for a national crypto reserve further enhances its attractiveness.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with strong stablecoin activity but concerns about a potential pullback. Holding position until clearer trends emerge.

SOL: +0.5 — Recovery from recent lows and undervaluation in DeFi space suggest potential upside. Positive technical indicators support a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from ETF speculation and technical setups indicate potential for further gains, though with less conviction than BTC or SOL.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-05 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news regarding a potential U.S. crypto reserve strategy and tariff delays, which have buoyed market sentiment. Ethereum, however, faces a pullback, with concerns about breaching the $2,000 mark despite strong stablecoin-driven activity. Solana shows signs of recovery after a recent crash, supported by undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news about potential national crypto reserves. The macroeconomic context also supports increased BTC allocation.

ETH: +0.1 — While there is some pullback pressure, Ethereum's strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support. However, caution is warranted due to potential downside risks.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem make Solana an attractive option, with technical indicators suggesting continued stabilization.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical setups and ETF optimism provide a moderate buy signal, though the speculative nature of DOGE warrants a balanced approach.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, there's a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets with higher potential returns."

2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable surge due to positive news regarding potential U.S. policy shifts towards a national crypto reserve. This has lifted Bitcoin's price and market sentiment, although it remains below the recent peak of $90,000. Ethereum is facing some pressure, with concerns about a potential pullback despite strong on-chain activity driven by stablecoin usage. Solana has shown resilience, rebounding after a recent crash, and continues to demonstrate strong network growth. Dogecoin is experiencing a speculative rally on ETF optimism, while Tether remains stable with regulatory clarity in Europe. Overall, the market is showing signs of bullish momentum, but with some caution due to mixed signals in certain assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news on potential U.S. crypto reserve plans and recent price gains. The macroeconomic environment is also supportive of risk assets.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price pressure, strong stablecoin-driven activity provides support. However, caution is warranted due to potential pullback risks.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent rebound and undervaluation relative to Ethereum suggest potential for further gains. Strong network growth adds to the positive outlook.

DOGE: +0.3 — Speculative interest driven by ETF optimism and technical bullish signals suggest potential for further upside, but volatility remains high.

USDT: -0.4 — As risk appetite increases, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT exposure in the portfolio."
2025-03-05 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news regarding potential U.S. crypto reserve strategies and tariff delays. This has lifted Bitcoin above $90,000, indicating robust demand. Ethereum faces some bearish pressure due to fears of a pullback, though its strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support. Solana has rebounded from recent lows, suggesting a potential stabilization, while Dogecoin benefits from ETF optimism and technical bullish signals. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, which supports a risk-on sentiment, though the high gold price suggests some underlying caution.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding a potential U.S. crypto reserve strategy are boosting demand. The technical indicators are also supportive, making BTC an attractive asset in the current environment.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent pullback fears, Ethereum's strong stablecoin-driven activity provides a supportive backdrop. However, caution is warranted due to potential downside risks.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recent rebound and undervaluation compared to Ethereum suggest potential for further gains. The technical indicators are positive, supporting a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from ETF optimism and technical bullish setups indicate potential for further upside. However, the speculative nature of DOGE warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.5 — With a risk-on sentiment prevailing and positive developments in other assets, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT into higher-return opportunities."
2025-03-05 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with several positive developments across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has shown strong upward momentum, driven by news of potential U.S. government interest in a national crypto reserve and a delay in tariffs, which has buoyed market sentiment. Ethereum is experiencing some weakness, with concerns about a potential pullback, although its role in stablecoin issuance provides underlying support. Solana has rebounded significantly after a recent crash, indicating potential stabilization, while Dogecoin has rallied on ETF optimism and technical bullish signals. Tether remains stable, with regulatory clarifications supporting its continued use in Europe despite some delistings.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news regarding potential U.S. government interest in Bitcoin. The macroeconomic environment and recent price movements suggest continued strength.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite recent weakness, Ethereum's role in stablecoin issuance provides support. However, caution is warranted due to potential pullback fears.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent rebound and undervaluation in the DeFi space compared to Ethereum suggest potential for further gains. Positive sentiment from recent price recovery supports a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: +0.3 — ETF optimism and technical indicators suggest a potential rebound, although the overall market position remains speculative.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2025-03-05 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news regarding potential U.S. government support for a national crypto reserve. This has lifted market sentiment, pushing BTC prices higher. Ethereum, however, faces mixed signals with concerns about a potential pullback, though its role in stablecoin issuance provides some support. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, with undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem noted as a potential growth area. Dogecoin is experiencing bullish sentiment due to ETF optimism and technical indicators suggesting a rebound. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarity in Europe supporting its continued use despite Binance's delisting in the EEA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and supportive news regarding potential government backing make BTC highly attractive for increased allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — While there are concerns about a pullback, Ethereum's stablecoin activity provides a buffer, warranting a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem suggest potential for further gains, making it an attractive option for increased exposure.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical indicators and ETF optimism provide a supportive backdrop, justifying a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in USDT allocation is warranted to rotate capital into more promising opportunities."

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.

4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with positive momentum and technical indicators across most major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing strong upward momentum, bolstered by news of potential U.S. government interest in a national crypto reserve, which has lifted market sentiment significantly. Ethereum, while facing some pullback fears, remains supported by its strong role in stablecoin issuance. Solana shows signs of stabilization after a recent crash, with reports suggesting undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is benefiting from ETF optimism and technical bullish setups, while USDT remains stable with regulatory clarity from ESMA.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news about potential U.S. government interest in Bitcoin, indicating robust demand and upward momentum.

ETH: +0.3 — While there are pullback concerns, Ethereum's strong role in stablecoin issuance provides a supportive backdrop, justifying a moderate positive allocation.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in DeFi tokens suggest potential for further upside, supported by strong network growth.

DOGE: +0.2 — ETF optimism and technical bullish patterns provide a mild positive outlook, though the speculative nature of DOGE warrants caution.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted to capitalize on potential gains in more volatile assets."
2025-03-05 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic news and strong upward momentum across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced significant gains due to news of potential U.S. crypto reserve strategies and tariff delays, pushing its price above $90,000. Ethereum, despite recent pullbacks, remains supported by strong stablecoin activity. Solana shows signs of recovery after a recent crash, with undervalued DeFi tokens compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin benefits from ETF optimism and technical bullish setups. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarity from ESMA supporting its use in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive news regarding potential U.S. crypto reserve strategies support further gains.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent pullbacks, stablecoin-driven activity provides underlying support, suggesting potential for recovery.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent rebound and undervaluation of DeFi tokens compared to Ethereum indicate potential for further upside.

DOGE: +0.2 — ETF optimism and technical bullish patterns suggest a moderate increase in allocation.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and bullish sentiment across other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."
2025-03-05 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, driven by positive macroeconomic developments and strong technical indicators across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable surge, fueled by news of a potential national crypto reserve and a delay in U.S. tariffs, pushing it close to the $90,000 mark. Ethereum, while facing some pullback fears, remains supported by strong stablecoin activity on its network. Solana shows signs of recovery after a recent crash, with undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem providing potential upside. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish signals. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarity supporting its continued use despite some delisting concerns in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding a potential national crypto reserve strategy are driving demand, making BTC highly attractive.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price weakness, Ethereum's strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support, though caution is warranted due to potential pullback risks.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recovery and undervaluation in its DeFi space suggest potential for further gains, supported by strong network growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical indicators and ETF-related optimism provide a supportive backdrop for Dogecoin, though volatility remains a consideration.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and bullish sentiment in the market, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely, reducing its relative attractiveness."
2025-03-05 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to positive news about potential U.S. crypto reserve plans and a delay in auto tariffs, which has pushed BTC above $90,000. Ethereum, while facing some pullback fears, remains supported by strong stablecoin activity on its network. Solana has shown signs of recovery after a recent crash, with reports highlighting its undervaluation compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is experiencing optimism due to potential ETF approval, while Tether remains stable with regulatory clarity in Europe. Given the macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable interest rates, the market appears to be in a risk-on mode, favoring cryptocurrencies over stablecoins.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong momentum from both technical indicators and positive news regarding a potential U.S. crypto reserve strategy. The macro environment supports a bullish stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent pullback fears, strong stablecoin activity provides a solid foundation. However, the risk of further downside keeps the score moderate.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential for further gains. Positive network growth supports a bullish outlook.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive sentiment from ETF speculation and technical setups indicate potential for a rebound, but the overall impact is less significant compared to other assets.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market in a risk-on phase, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets, reducing the need for USDT holdings."
2025-03-05 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to positive news from the U.S. government potentially considering a national crypto reserve strategy. This has boosted Bitcoin's price above $90,000, signaling strong demand and positive momentum. Ethereum, while experiencing some pullback fears, remains supported by its stablecoin dominance. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, with its DeFi ecosystem noted as undervalued compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is experiencing a technical rebound, fueled by ETF optimism. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with regulatory clarity from Europe supporting its continued use.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding a potential national crypto reserve strategy make Bitcoin highly attractive. Increased on-chain activity further supports this bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent pullback fears, Ethereum's strong stablecoin-driven activity provides a supportive backdrop. However, caution is warranted due to potential downside risks.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's rebound and undervaluation compared to Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem suggest potential upside. The recent price recovery indicates stabilizing trends.

DOGE: +0.3 — Technical indicators suggest a potential rebound, and ETF optimism provides a supportive sentiment. However, DOGE's speculative nature warrants a cautious approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in the market, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns elsewhere."

- *SOL rebounds ~7% to ~$144 after recent crash*
   Solana recovered nearly 7% in a single day following a ~15% slide, indicating a possible stabilizing trend after the sharp drop.
- *Solana DeFi tokens undervalued versus Ethereum equivalents*
   A Franklin Templeton report notes Solana’s DeFi ecosystem trades at lower valuation multiples than Ethereum’s—even as SOL shows strong network growth.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news regarding potential national crypto reserves and tariff delays. This has led to a significant price increase, crossing the $90,000 mark. Ethereum, however, faces bearish pressure as it approaches the $2,000 level, despite strong stablecoin-driven activity. Solana has shown signs of recovery after a recent crash, suggesting potential stabilization, while Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish signals. USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarity in Europe supporting its use, although market conditions suggest a potential shift towards riskier assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong buy signals from both technical indicators and positive news developments, suggesting continued upward momentum.

ETH: -0.1 — Despite strong on-chain activity, ETH faces downward pressure with potential to breach $2,000, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation relative to Ethereum suggest potential upside, supported by network growth.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical patterns and ETF speculation provide a moderate bullish outlook.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent."
2025-03-05 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive macroeconomic news, such as the U.S. government's potential crypto reserve strategy and tariff delays. Ethereum faces some bearish pressure due to pullback fears, although its strong role in stablecoin issuance provides some support. Solana is showing signs of stabilization after a recent crash, with potential undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin is experiencing a technical bullish setup, supported by ETF optimism. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarifications ensuring its continued use in the European market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish signals from both macroeconomic news and technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making it a favorable asset for increased allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent price weakness and strong stablecoin activity. The potential for further downside keeps the score neutral.

SOL: +0.3 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential for growth, but caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

DOGE: +0.2 — Positive technical patterns and ETF optimism provide a mild bullish signal, though the speculative nature of DOGE warrants a conservative approach.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified to reallocate capital towards growth opportunities."
2025-03-05 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news regarding potential U.S. crypto reserve strategies and tariff delays. Ethereum faces some bearish pressure due to recent price declines, though its strong stablecoin activity provides underlying support. Solana is recovering from a recent crash, with signs of stabilization and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is experiencing a positive sentiment boost from ETF speculation and technical bullish signals. USDT remains stable, with no significant regulatory constraints affecting its usage, but there is a general trend towards risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased on-chain activity. The potential for a national crypto reserve adds to the bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price weakness, strong stablecoin activity supports Ethereum. However, caution is warranted due to potential further declines.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space make Solana attractive, with signs of stabilization after a sharp drop.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive technical indicators and ETF speculation provide a bullish outlook, though the overall market impact remains moderate.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other assets, there is a slight preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins."
2025-03-05 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news regarding potential U.S. crypto reserve strategies and tariff delays. This has provided a boost to Bitcoin's price, which has crossed significant psychological levels. Ethereum, however, faces mixed signals with strong on-chain activity supporting its usage, but fears of a price pullback persist. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, supported by undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is experiencing a rally due to ETF optimism and technical bullish setups, while Tether remains stable with regulatory clarity in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and on-chain activity. The potential for a national crypto reserve is a significant bullish factor.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong on-chain activity, concerns about a potential price pullback and mixed momentum signals warrant a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential upside, though technical indicators are mixed.

DOGE: +0.3 — Positive sentiment from ETF speculation and technical patterns suggest potential for further gains, though volatility remains high.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is advisable."
2025-03-05 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum due to favorable macroeconomic news, including potential government interest in crypto reserves and tariff delays. This has led to a notable price increase for BTC, which has also positively influenced the broader crypto market. Ethereum, however, faces mixed signals with a recent price pullback and concerns about breaching key support levels, though its strong stablecoin activity provides some support. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, supported by undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish setups, while USDT remains stable amid regulatory clarifications in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding potential government crypto reserves are driving demand, making BTC a preferred asset for capital allocation.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite strong stablecoin activity, ETH is facing downward pressure with potential support breaches, leading to a neutral stance.

SOL: +0.3 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to recent volatility.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive technical signals and ETF optimism provide a bullish outlook, warranting increased allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in the market, there is a slight preference to reduce stablecoin exposure in favor of more volatile assets."
2025-03-05 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is generally positive, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to favorable news regarding potential U.S. government interest in a national crypto reserve and a tariff delay announcement. This has pushed BTC above the $90,000 mark, signaling strong upward momentum. Ethereum, despite its recent price drop, maintains robust network activity driven by stablecoin usage. Solana is showing signs of recovery after a recent crash, with reports suggesting its DeFi ecosystem is undervalued compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is experiencing a bullish setup, supported by speculation around a potential ETF approval. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarifications ensuring its continued use in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by significant news and technical indicators. The potential for a national crypto reserve adds to the positive sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price weakness, strong network activity and stablecoin dominance provide a supportive backdrop, suggesting potential for recovery.

SOL: +0.2 — Recent price rebound and undervaluation of its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum indicate a stabilizing trend, though technical signals remain mixed.

DOGE: +0.5 — Bullish technical patterns and ETF speculation provide a positive outlook, suggesting potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in the market, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2025-03-05 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to positive news regarding potential U.S. government interest in a crypto reserve strategy and tariff delays. This has bolstered BTC's price, pushing it above $90k and creating a ripple effect across the crypto market. Ethereum, while facing some bearish sentiment due to a recent price drop, maintains strong usage metrics driven by stablecoin activity. Solana shows signs of recovery after a recent crash, supported by undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is buoyed by ETF optimism and technical bullish signals. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, with regulatory clarifications ensuring its continued use in Europe despite some delistings.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding potential government interest in Bitcoin support a bullish stance. Increased on-chain activity further bolsters confidence.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent price weakness, Ethereum's strong usage metrics and stablecoin-driven activity provide a supportive backdrop, warranting a modestly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — Recent recovery and undervaluation in the DeFi space suggest potential for further gains, though caution is warranted due to previous volatility.

DOGE: +0.5 — Positive technical indicators and ETF-related optimism provide a supportive environment for potential gains, justifying a moderately bullish position.

USDT: -0.4 — With increasing risk appetite and positive sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-05 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by positive news regarding potential U.S. government interest in establishing a crypto reserve. This has lifted Bitcoin's price significantly, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Ethereum, while experiencing some pullback fears, remains supported by strong stablecoin activity on its network. Solana is recovering from a recent crash, showing signs of stabilization and potential undervaluation in its DeFi ecosystem compared to Ethereum. Dogecoin is benefiting from ETF optimism and technical bullish setups, suggesting a potential rebound. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with regulatory clarifications supporting its continued use despite some delistings in Europe.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news about potential U.S. government interest in Bitcoin support a bullish outlook. Increased on-chain activity further reinforces this sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent pullback fears, Ethereum's strong stablecoin-driven activity provides underlying support, making it a moderately attractive asset in the current environment.

SOL: +0.5 — Solana's recovery from a recent crash and its undervaluation in the DeFi space compared to Ethereum suggest potential for further gains, supported by positive technical indicators.

DOGE: +0.2 — ETF optimism and technical bullish patterns indicate a potential rebound, warranting a slight positive allocation despite its speculative nature.

USDT: -0.4 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in other cryptocurrencies, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capture potential gains in more volatile assets."
2025-03-06 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to the U.S. government's strategic initiatives and upcoming White House summit. This has driven BTC prices above $92K, reflecting strong upward momentum. Ethereum faces a mixed outlook; while technical indicators suggest a potential bullish correction, the delay in the Pectra upgrade introduces uncertainty. Solana's market sentiment is mixed, with debates around staking rewards and a wide trading range. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's recent actions against a sanctioned exchange highlight regulatory risks but do not significantly impact its stablecoin status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by macroeconomic news and increased trading volume. The strategic reserve news adds a bullish long-term outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, ETH maintains a bullish technical setup. However, resistance near $2,245 tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: +0.3 — While the staking rewards debate introduces some uncertainty, the asset remains within a bullish trading range, supported by positive technical indicators.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, DOGE remains neutral in the current market environment.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins like USDT into more volatile assets, especially given the bullish sentiment in BTC."
2025-03-06 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is moderately bullish, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to significant developments such as the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the U.S. government and a surge in price above $92K. This positive momentum is supported by increased trading volumes and optimism from upcoming regulatory discussions. Ethereum, despite a bullish price forecast, faces technical challenges with the delayed Pectra upgrade, which may introduce some uncertainty. Solana is experiencing mixed sentiment as stakeholders debate staking rewards, but it has shown resilience in reclaiming higher price levels. Dogecoin has seen a price increase without significant news, indicating speculative interest. Tether remains stable, though recent actions to freeze assets on a sanctioned exchange highlight ongoing regulatory pressures.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and significant positive news developments support further upside. The strategic reserve announcement adds a layer of institutional confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical challenges with the Pectra upgrade, the overall market sentiment is positive, and ETH's price is showing signs of recovery.

SOL: +0.5 — Recent price recovery and ongoing debates about staking rewards suggest potential for further gains, supported by a bullish market environment.

DOGE: +0.2 — Price increases and speculative interest, despite the lack of significant news, warrant a modest positive outlook.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the overall bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins into riskier assets."
2025-03-06 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with several cryptocurrencies showing bullish momentum and positive price movements over the past few hours. Bitcoin has surged above $92K, driven by increased trading volume and optimism surrounding a U.S. executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Ethereum, while facing some technical hurdles with its Pectra upgrade, has shown a bullish correction attempt. Solana's price outlook is mixed, with debates on staking rewards potentially impacting its investment appeal. Dogecoin has experienced a price breakout, although no significant news has been reported. Tether's recent action of freezing USDT on a sanctioned exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges but does not significantly impact its stablecoin status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum and positive news regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and upcoming crypto summit support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical upgrade delays, ETH shows bullish momentum and a potential breakout, warranting moderate optimism.

SOL: +0.2 — While price movements are positive, ongoing debates about staking rewards introduce some uncertainty, suggesting a cautious approach.

DOGE: +0.1 — Price breakout and bullish momentum are positive, but the absence of significant news keeps the signal modest.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment in other assets, there's a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins to capitalize on potential gains."
2025-03-06 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bullish, with significant upward momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Bitcoin is experiencing a surge in price, driven by optimistic news regarding the U.S. government's strategic reserve and upcoming White House summit. Ethereum, despite some technical setbacks with the Pectra upgrade, shows bullish potential, although it faces resistance. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with debates on staking rewards potentially affecting its appeal. Dogecoin has seen significant price increases, possibly due to broader market trends rather than specific news. Tether remains stable but faces scrutiny due to its actions against a sanctioned exchange. The macroeconomic environment, with a relatively high volatility index and stable dollar index, suggests a cautious but optimistic risk appetite.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news regarding the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and upcoming summit. On-chain activity remains robust, indicating continued interest.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, Ethereum shows bullish momentum and potential for upward movement, though resistance remains a concern.

SOL: +0.3 — Positive price trends and market activity, though debates on staking rewards introduce some uncertainty. The asset remains attractive within its trading range.

DOGE: +0.4 — Significant price increase and bullish momentum, likely driven by broader market trends. Lack of specific news suggests reliance on overall market sentiment.

USDT: -0.3 — With the bullish sentiment across other assets, there is a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2025-03-06 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears bullish, particularly for Bitcoin, which has surged past $92K amid positive news regarding a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and an upcoming White House summit. Ethereum is showing bullish momentum, though it faces technical resistance and a delay in its Pectra upgrade, which may temper enthusiasm. Solana is experiencing mixed sentiment with debates over staking rewards, but it maintains a strong technical position within its trading range. Dogecoin is benefiting from strong upward momentum and significant price increases, although there is no major news driving this. Tether remains stable but faces regulatory challenges, as seen with the freezing of assets on a sanctioned exchange.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum supported by positive news and increased trading volume. The strategic reserve development adds a significant bullish narrative.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, ETH maintains bullish momentum and is poised to test resistance levels. However, caution is warranted due to potential downside pressure.

SOL: +0.5 — Solid technical indicators and a stable price range suggest continued strength, though the debate over staking rewards could introduce some volatility.

DOGE: +0.6 — Significant price increase and bullish momentum, even in the absence of major news, indicate strong market interest and potential for further gains.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing bullish tendencies, there is a shift away from stablecoins like USDT as investors seek higher returns in more volatile assets."
2025-03-06 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

Ethereum, while showing bullish technical signals, faces uncertainty due to delays in its Pectra upgrade. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with discussions around staking rewards and a wide trading range. Dogecoin lacks significant news, though it has shown price volatility. Tether remains stable, but recent actions against a sanctioned exchange highlight regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and positive news have bolstered Bitcoin's outlook, making it a key asset to hold and potentially increase exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical challenges with the Pectra upgrade, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum, though caution is warranted due to potential resistance levels.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana's price outlook is mixed, the ongoing discussions about staking rewards could enhance its long-term appeal, justifying a modest increase in allocation.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed price movements, Dogecoin remains a hold without a clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases and capital rotates into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure is prudent to capitalize on potential gains in other cryptocurrencies."
2025-03-06 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by significant news, including the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a surge in price ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum, while facing some technical delays, maintains a bullish outlook, though it struggles with resistance levels. Solana's market is mixed, with debates on staking rewards and a stable price range. Dogecoin lacks significant news, but its recent price movements show volatility. Tether remains stable, though recent actions to freeze assets on a sanctioned exchange highlight ongoing regulatory challenges. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high volatility and stable gold and oil prices, suggests a mixed risk environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum supported by significant news and increased trading volume. The strategic reserve development adds long-term confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical delays, the overall sentiment remains positive with a bullish forecast, though resistance levels warrant caution.

SOL: +0.2 — Stable price within a defined range and ongoing discussions on staking rewards suggest potential for growth, albeit with some risk.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed price movements suggest a neutral stance, with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies, there's a tendency to rotate capital out of stablecoins."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge due to significant developments such as the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the U.S. government and a surge in price ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum, while showing bullish tendencies, faces technical challenges with its delayed Pectra upgrade. Solana is experiencing mixed signals, with debates on staking rewards and a potential test of its support/resistance levels. Dogecoin lacks significant news, but its recent price movements suggest some volatility. Tether's recent freezing of assets on a sanctioned Russian exchange highlights regulatory actions impacting stablecoins. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high volatility and a stable U.S. Dollar Index, suggests a cautious but opportunistic approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and strategic developments, coupled with positive momentum and on-chain activity, make BTC highly attractive for capital allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical delays, ETH shows bullish momentum and potential for upward movement, though with some caution due to resistance levels.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed signals from market trends and internal debates on staking rewards suggest a cautious approach, but recent price increases provide some optimism.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and mixed price movements suggest a neutral stance, maintaining current exposure without additional allocation.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2025-03-06 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by significant news regarding the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a surge in price ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum, while facing technical delays with the Pectra upgrade, is attempting a bullish correction, though it faces resistance. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with debates on staking rewards potentially affecting its investment appeal. Dogecoin lacks significant news, maintaining a neutral stance. Tether's recent freeze of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory challenges but does not significantly impact its stability as a safe haven.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news and strong momentum suggest further upside potential. The strategic reserve announcement and price surge above $92K bolster confidence.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical delays, ETH shows bullish momentum and attempts to break resistance, warranting a cautious increase in exposure.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed outlook with potential for price testing within a defined range. The debate on staking rewards introduces some uncertainty, but recent price recovery is encouraging.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.5 — With increasing risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, reducing stablecoin holdings to allocate capital towards more promising opportunities is advisable."
2025-03-06 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin leading the charge as it surges above $92K, buoyed by positive news regarding a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and an upcoming White House summit. This has generated bullish momentum across major cryptocurrencies, although Ethereum faces some technical challenges with its delayed Pectra upgrade. Solana shows resilience with a significant price increase, while Dogecoin remains relatively stable without major news influences. The macroeconomic environment, marked by a stable U.S. Dollar Index and elevated S&P 500 levels, suggests a moderate risk-on sentiment, though the high VIX indicates potential volatility. Tether's recent freezing of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks but does not significantly impact its stablecoin status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong upward momentum driven by strategic reserve news and upcoming summit. On-chain activity supports bullish sentiment.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical upgrade delays, ETH maintains bullish momentum and slight price increases, suggesting potential for further gains.

SOL: +0.5 — Significant price increase and bullish momentum, with potential to test higher resistance levels. Positive sentiment from market trends.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price movements suggest a neutral stance, with no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment turns risk-on, capital is likely to rotate out of stablecoins into more volatile assets like BTC and SOL."
2025-03-06 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by strategic developments such as the U.S. government's establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a surge in price ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum, while facing technical delays with its Pectra upgrade, maintains a bullish outlook despite resistance challenges. Solana is experiencing mixed sentiment, with discussions around staking rewards and a price range that suggests potential volatility. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, while Tether's recent freeze of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks but does not significantly impact its stablecoin status. Overall, the macroeconomic environment, with relatively high volatility and stable dollar index, suggests a balanced approach to risk and reward.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — Strong buy signals from both macroeconomic developments and recent price momentum, supported by strategic government actions and increased trading volume.

**ETH: +0.3** — Despite technical delays, ETH shows bullish momentum and a potential for upward correction, though resistance levels warrant cautious optimism.

**SOL: +0.5** — Positive price movement and ongoing discussions about staking rewards suggest potential for growth, though market trends indicate possible volatility.

**DOGE: 0.0** — Lack of significant news and stable technical indicators suggest a neutral stance, with no clear signals for change.

**USDT: -0.4** — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in other assets, capital rotation out of stablecoins is likely, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed sentiment with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and a moderate level of volatility indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing some volatility, with Bitcoin showing a significant decrease in price despite positive news about a strategic reserve and upcoming summit. Ethereum faces technical challenges with its delayed upgrade, while Solana's community debates changes to staking rewards that could affect its investment appeal. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether's recent actions to freeze assets on a sanctioned exchange may impact its stability perception. Overall, the market shows cautious optimism with potential for bullish trends, but technical and regulatory uncertainties remain.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price drop, positive news about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and upcoming summit suggests potential for recovery. The buy signal from the trend indicator supports a moderate positive outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Although facing technical challenges with the Pectra upgrade, the bullish forecast and strong on-chain activity provide a slightly positive outlook. However, resistance levels may limit upside potential.

SOL: +0.3 — The ongoing debate about staking rewards and mixed price outlook suggest some uncertainty, but the overall trend and momentum indicators remain positive, supporting a moderate buy signal.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical indicators, Dogecoin remains neutral. The lack of strong directional signals suggests holding the current position.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the potential for bullish trends in other assets and the recent actions against a sanctioned exchange, there is a slight preference to reduce exposure to USDT in favor of more volatile assets."
2025-03-06 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a mixed environment with relatively high volatility (VIX at 24.87) and a strong U.S. dollar index (DXY at 104.06), which typically exerts downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, the crypto market is showing signs of resilience, particularly with Bitcoin experiencing a surge above $92K due to positive sentiment from a U.S. executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and anticipation of a White House summit. Ethereum is facing technical challenges with the delay of the Pectra upgrade, which could dampen short-term enthusiasm. Solana is experiencing internal debates on staking rewards, which could affect its investment appeal. Meanwhile, Tether's recent freeze of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights ongoing regulatory risks in the stablecoin space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and anticipation of a White House summit are strong bullish signals, combined with a recent price surge and positive trend indicators.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the delay in the Pectra upgrade, ETH shows bullish technical signals and a potential for upward correction, though resistance remains a challenge.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite internal debates on staking rewards, SOL's price is within a favorable range, and technical indicators remain positive, suggesting potential for gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, DOGE remains neutral in terms of allocation preference.

USDT: -0.5 — In light of the bullish sentiment in BTC and other assets, and regulatory concerns surrounding Tether, there is a preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of riskier assets."
2025-03-06 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum driven by strategic reserve news and positive developments from the U.S. government. Ethereum is facing mixed signals due to technical issues with its Pectra upgrade, although there is a bullish forecast if resistance levels are surpassed. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with debates on staking rewards potentially affecting its appeal. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether's actions on a sanctioned exchange highlight regulatory challenges. The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with no extreme volatility, suggesting a balanced approach to asset allocation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news regarding the strategic reserve and strong price momentum suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin, warranting increased allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical challenges, Ethereum's bullish forecast and strong on-chain activity support a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.2 — Mixed market outlook and ongoing debates on staking rewards suggest a cautious but slightly positive stance on Solana.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or changes in technical indicators, maintaining the current allocation is prudent.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment in other assets and the lack of bullish signals, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-06 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of strength due to the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a recent surge above $92K. Ethereum is facing mixed signals, with a bullish forecast tempered by technical resistance and delays in its Pectra upgrade. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with debates on staking rewards and potential price fluctuations within a defined range. Dogecoin remains relatively stable with no significant news, while Tether is dealing with regulatory challenges, impacting its operations on sanctioned exchanges. Given the macroeconomic context, with high volatility and a strong dollar, there is a cautious approach towards risk assets, though recent developments in Bitcoin suggest a potential shift in sentiment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and recent price surge above $92K indicate strong upward momentum. Increased trading volume and optimism from the Fed's digital asset strategy further support a bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite technical resistance and delays in the Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's price increase and on-chain activity suggest a moderate positive outlook. However, caution is warranted due to potential downside pressure.

SOL: +0.2 — While Solana has reclaimed a higher price range, mixed market trends and debates on staking rewards suggest a cautious but slightly positive stance. The potential for testing support or resistance levels adds to the uncertainty.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable price movements, Dogecoin remains neutral. The lack of major developments or market shifts keeps the outlook steady.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the recent positive developments in Bitcoin and the potential for increased risk appetite, there is a preference to rotate capital out of stablecoins like USDT. The regulatory challenges faced by Tether also contribute to a reduced allocation preference."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears mixed with a slight bearish tilt. Bitcoin's price has been volatile, with recent news of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve potentially providing a bullish catalyst. However, the broader macroeconomic context, including a high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility (VIX), suggests caution. Ethereum is facing technical resistance and delays in its network upgrade, which may dampen investor enthusiasm. Solana is experiencing internal debates on staking rewards, which could affect its appeal, while Dogecoin lacks significant news to drive sentiment. Tether's actions against a sanctioned exchange highlight regulatory risks but do not directly impact its stability as a stablecoin. Given these dynamics, a cautious approach with a slight preference for stability and selective risk exposure is warranted.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite recent price volatility, the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve provides a bullish narrative, and increased on-chain activity supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — The delay in the Pectra upgrade and resistance at current levels create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.2 — While facing internal debates on staking rewards, Solana's price is within a potential support range, suggesting a cautious buy opportunity if it holds above key levels.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and mixed technical signals, maintaining a neutral position is prudent.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market conditions and macroeconomic uncertainty, a moderate allocation to USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."
2025-03-06 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility, as indicated by the VIX, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. Bitcoin has seen a recent surge in price, driven by optimistic news regarding a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a crypto summit, although technical indicators remain bearish. Ethereum faces technical challenges with the delayed Pectra upgrade, contributing to mixed sentiment despite a bullish price forecast. Solana's market outlook is mixed, with internal debates on staking rewards affecting sentiment. Dogecoin has no significant news, while Tether's involvement in freezing assets on a sanctioned exchange may raise concerns about regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite bearish technical indicators, positive news about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and upcoming summit provide a bullish sentiment boost. 

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed technical signals and the delay of the Pectra upgrade create uncertainty, balancing the bullish price forecast.

SOL: +0.2 — Although technical indicators are not strongly bullish, the potential for testing resistance levels and ongoing debates about staking rewards suggest moderate upside potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and neutral technical indicators suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the positive developments in BTC and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, a slight reduction in USDT is warranted to capitalize on potential gains elsewhere."
2025-03-06 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with Bitcoin showing strong upward momentum, driven by significant news regarding the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a surge in price above $92K ahead of a White House summit. Ethereum, however, faces mixed sentiment due to a delayed network upgrade and resistance at key technical levels. Solana shows potential for volatility with discussions around staking rewards and a mixed price outlook. Dogecoin lacks significant news, and Tether is dealing with regulatory actions affecting its operations on certain exchanges. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high volatility and stable gold and dollar indices, suggests a cautious approach, with potential for selective risk-taking in cryptocurrencies.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong news catalysts and price momentum, coupled with increased on-chain activity, make Bitcoin an attractive asset to increase exposure to at present.

ETH: +0.2 — While facing technical resistance, the overall bullish forecast and significant on-chain activity suggest a modest increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite mixed news and low on-chain activity, the potential for price movement within the $115–$155 range offers a favorable risk-reward scenario.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable technical indicators, maintaining current exposure is prudent.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment and potential for upward movement in other cryptocurrencies, reducing stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital into riskier assets seems appropriate."
2025-03-06 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a slight bullish tilt, particularly for Bitcoin, which has seen a surge in price due to positive news regarding the U.S. government's strategic reserve plans and upcoming crypto summit. However, technical indicators for most assets, including BTC, ETH, and DOGE, remain bearish, with prices generally below long-term moving averages and MACD signals indicating a lack of bullish momentum. Ethereum faces technical resistance and delays in its network upgrade, adding to the uncertainty. Solana's mixed outlook is compounded by internal debates on staking rewards, though it remains within a critical price range. Tether's recent freezing of assets on a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks but does not significantly impact its stablecoin status. Given the current macroeconomic context, with moderate volatility and stable gold and oil prices, the market is likely to remain in a state of cautious capital rotation.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive news regarding the strategic reserve and upcoming summit provide a bullish sentiment, though technical indicators remain bearish. A moderate increase in allocation is warranted to capture potential upside.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a bullish forecast, technical resistance and delays in the Pectra upgrade create uncertainty. Hold current position until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: +0.3 — Although technical indicators are mixed, the price remains within a critical range, and potential changes in staking rewards could enhance investment appeal. A slight increase in allocation is justified.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and bearish technical indicators suggest maintaining the current position without additional allocation.

USDT: -0.3 — Given the slight bullish sentiment in the broader market, reduce exposure to USDT to allocate more capital towards potentially appreciating assets like BTC and SOL."
2025-03-06 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing resilience and potential for upward movement, particularly in light of the U.S. government's strategic interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This development, along with the anticipation of a crypto summit, has bolstered BTC's position. Ethereum, on the other hand, faces technical challenges with the delayed Pectra upgrade, which may dampen its short-term momentum despite a bullish technical outlook. Solana is experiencing internal debates on staking rewards, which could impact its attractiveness to investors, while Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news. Tether's recent action against a sanctioned exchange highlights regulatory risks but does not significantly impact its role as a stablecoin in the current market environment.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news regarding the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and upcoming crypto summit provide strong bullish sentiment, suggesting increased capital allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite technical upgrade delays, the potential for a bullish correction and overall market optimism support a modest positive allocation.

SOL: +0.1 — Mixed outlook with internal debates on staking rewards; however, the price stability within a key range supports a slight positive bias.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant news and stable price movement suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased optimism in risk assets like BTC and ETH, reducing stablecoin holdings to reallocate capital seems prudent."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility, as indicated by the VIX. The S&P 500 is performing well, suggesting a generally positive risk appetite in traditional markets. In the crypto space, Bitcoin has shown signs of bullish momentum, driven by news of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and anticipation of a White House summit. Ethereum is facing technical challenges with its delayed Pectra upgrade, which could dampen short-term sentiment despite a bullish price forecast. Solana's community is debating changes to staking rewards, which could impact its attractiveness to investors. Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news, while Tether's recent freeze of assets on a sanctioned exchange may raise concerns about regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive news regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and upcoming summit, combined with recent price increases, suggest strong bullish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite a bullish forecast, the delay in the Pectra upgrade introduces uncertainty, balancing the outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — While there are debates over staking rewards, the price remains within a stable range, suggesting moderate potential for gains.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news and stable price movements, there is no clear signal to adjust the current position.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the positive sentiment in BTC and stable conditions in other assets, there is a rationale to reduce USDT holdings and rotate into riskier assets."
2025-03-06 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of strength driven by strategic governmental interest and upcoming summits. This has led to a price surge, although it remains below the $92K mark. Ethereum faces technical challenges with its delayed Pectra upgrade, which may dampen bullish momentum despite a positive price forecast. Solana is experiencing internal debates over staking rewards, which could affect its investment appeal, while Dogecoin remains stable with no significant news. Tether's recent actions to freeze assets on a sanctioned exchange highlight ongoing regulatory challenges, but its stability remains intact. The macroeconomic environment, with high volatility and stable interest rates, suggests a mixed but slightly risk-on sentiment, favoring strategic allocations into growth assets while maintaining some defensive positions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the U.S. government and positive price momentum ahead of a crypto summit indicate strong institutional interest and potential for further gains.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite technical delays, Ethereum's price has shown resilience. However, the uncertainty around the Pectra upgrade tempers enthusiasm, leading to a cautious but slightly positive outlook.

SOL: +0.3 — While internal debates over staking rewards could introduce volatility, Solana's price stability within a key range suggests potential for upward movement if market conditions improve.

DOGE: 0.0 — With no significant news or technical changes, Dogecoin remains neutral. Its price movements are largely in line with broader market trends, offering no clear directional bias.

USDT: -0.4 — Given the positive sentiment in risk assets like BTC and the potential for capital rotation into growth assets, reducing stablecoin holdings slightly is warranted to capitalize on market opportunities."
2025-03-06 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context shows a mixed environment with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility as indicated by the VIX. The crypto market is experiencing a lack of strong bullish signals across major assets, with technical indicators showing no clear buy signals for BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. However, Bitcoin has seen a surge in price due to positive news about a strategic reserve and upcoming White House summit, which could provide a bullish catalyst. Ethereum faces technical resistance and delays in its network upgrade, while Solana's community debates changes that could affect its attractiveness. Tether's recent action against a sanctioned exchange may impact its perception as a stablecoin. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic for BTC, while other assets show mixed signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.5** — Positive news about the strategic reserve and upcoming summit provides a bullish outlook despite mixed technicals. This supports a moderate increase in allocation.

**ETH: 0.0** — The delay in the Pectra upgrade and resistance around $2,245 create uncertainty, warranting a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

**SOL: +0.2** — Although technical indicators are not bullish, the ongoing discussions about staking rewards and its current price range suggest potential for upward movement, justifying a slight positive bias.

**DOGE: 0.0** — With no significant news and neutral technical indicators, maintaining the current position is prudent.

**USDT: -0.3** — Given the potential for BTC to rise and the lack of strong bearish signals in the market, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is appropriate to capitalize on potential gains in other assets."
2025-03-07 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market sentiment is bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. The recent U.S. announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve has not led to new purchases, causing traders to hedge with put options, indicating a lack of confidence in immediate price recovery. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing similar downside protection activities, while Dogecoin has been affected by disappointment over its exclusion from the reserve plan. Tether remains stable, although its recent freeze of $27 million USDT on a Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite the strategic reserve announcement, the lack of new purchases and increased hedging activity suggest caution. The significant price drop and technical breakdown further support reducing exposure.

ETH: -0.3 — The bearish sentiment and increased put options activity, combined with a significant price decline, warrant a cautious stance. However, whale accumulation provides a slight buffer against a stronger sell signal.

SOL: -0.4 — The negative reaction to the reserve announcement and significant price drop, along with the co-founder's opposition, indicate a need to reduce exposure.

DOGE: -0.2 — The exclusion from the reserve plan and significant price decline suggest reducing exposure, though the overall impact is less severe than for other assets.

USDT: +0.4 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher stablecoin exposure is prudent to preserve capital and provide liquidity for potential future opportunities."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a slight bearish tilt, primarily due to macroeconomic uncertainties and recent developments. The announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has created a mixed reaction, with traders seeking downside protection through put options across BTC, ETH, and SOL. This has led to increased volatility and a temporary dip in prices. The macroeconomic indicators, such as a relatively high 10-Year Treasury Yield and elevated VIX, suggest a risk-averse environment, which might favor stable assets like USDT. However, the recent price recovery in the last hour indicates some resilience in the crypto market.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve news, the lack of new purchases and increased put option activity suggest caution. The recent price recovery is not enough to offset the bearish sentiment.

ETH: 0.0 — While whale accumulation is a positive sign, the overall sentiment remains mixed with increased put activity and low social chatter. Holding position seems prudent.

SOL: -0.2 — The negative sentiment from the reserve news and the co-founder’s objections have weighed on SOL. Despite a recent price uptick, the overall outlook remains cautious.

DOGE: -0.1 — The exclusion from the reserve plan and legal uncertainties contribute to a bearish sentiment. However, the price recovery suggests some resilience, warranting only a slight reduction.

USDT: +0.6 — In a risk-averse environment, maintaining higher exposure to USDT is prudent. The stablecoin's role as a safe haven is reinforced by macroeconomic uncertainties and recent market volatility."
2025-03-07 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain with elevated volatility (VIX at 23.37) and a stable U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 103.84), suggesting cautious market sentiment. The recent executive order by President Trump to include Bitcoin in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has introduced a significant development, yet it has not translated into immediate bullish momentum for BTC, as traders hedge with put options. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing similar hedging activities, with SOL facing additional pressure from its exclusion from the primary reserve. Dogecoin has been impacted negatively by the reserve announcement, while Tether's recent action of freezing funds on a Russian exchange indicates ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.2 — Despite the strategic reserve news, the lack of immediate buying and hedging activity suggests caution. However, the recognition of BTC as a reserve asset provides a long-term bullish underpinning.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with increased whale accumulation but ongoing hedging activities. The lack of immediate bullish technical indicators keeps ETH in a neutral position.

SOL: -0.1 — The exclusion from the primary reserve and co-founder objections create uncertainty. High on-chain activity is a positive, but sentiment remains cautious.

DOGE: -0.3 — Negative sentiment from being excluded from the reserve plan and legal uncertainties weigh on DOGE. Current holdings suggest reducing exposure.

USDT: +0.5 — In a volatile market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is prudent to manage risk and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-03-07 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility and uncertainty, largely driven by macroeconomic factors and recent geopolitical developments. The U.S. government's formal recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset has introduced a new dynamic, causing mixed reactions across the crypto market. While Bitcoin sees increased hedging activity, Ethereum and Solana are experiencing downside protection buying, reflecting investor caution. Solana and Dogecoin have been negatively impacted by their exclusion from the U.S. reserve strategy, leading to price declines. Meanwhile, Tether's recent action to freeze assets on a Russian exchange has stirred concerns but also underscores its role as a stable asset in volatile times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent price volatility and hedging activity, the strategic reserve announcement provides a long-term bullish outlook, warranting a modest increase in allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation and contrarian signals from low social sentiment suggest potential upside, though caution is advised due to ongoing hedging activity.

SOL: -0.1 — The negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and public objections by its co-founder suggest a cautious stance, although high on-chain activity could offer some support.

DOGE: -0.3 — The lack of inclusion in the reserve strategy and recent legal uncertainties contribute to a negative outlook, justifying a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of market volatility and geopolitical tensions, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-03-07 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with significant macroeconomic developments influencing crypto assets. The U.S. government's formal recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset has created mixed reactions. While this move is a long-term positive signal for Bitcoin, the lack of immediate purchases has led to increased hedging activities, as seen in the rise of short-dated put options for BTC, ETH, and SOL. Ethereum is experiencing a dip in social sentiment, but whale accumulation suggests underlying bullishness. Solana and Dogecoin have faced negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the U.S. reserve strategy, leading to price declines. Meanwhile, Tether's actions against a Russian exchange have not significantly impacted its stability but highlight ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The strategic reserve news is a long-term positive, despite short-term hedging. Current price increases and normal on-chain activity support a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite short-term hedging, whale accumulation indicates potential upside. The slight price recovery and normal activity suggest a cautious buy.

SOL: 0.0 — Negative sentiment from reserve exclusion and objections from its co-founder balance out the recent price stability and high on-chain activity, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — Recent negative news and low on-chain activity suggest reducing exposure, though the score is limited by current holdings.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the market's cautious sentiment and the need for liquidity, maintaining a slightly positive score for USDT is prudent to manage risk exposure."
2025-03-07 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The recent announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has created a mixed sentiment in the crypto market. While Bitcoin's official recognition as a reserve asset is a significant milestone, the lack of immediate purchases has led to increased hedging activity. Ethereum and Solana have seen similar hedging behaviors, with traders seeking downside protection. Solana and Dogecoin have been negatively impacted by their exclusion from the reserve plan, while Tether's recent action against a Russian exchange has raised concerns about its operational stability.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The strategic reserve news is a long-term positive, despite short-term hedging. BTC remains a strong asset with potential for future appreciation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite short-term hedging, whale accumulation suggests confidence in ETH's long-term value. The current price dip may present a buying opportunity.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion, but high on-chain activity suggests underlying interest.

DOGE: -0.3 — Negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and lack of significant positive catalysts make DOGE less attractive in the current environment.

USDT: +0.2 — While generally a safe haven, recent operational concerns suggest a cautious approach. However, maintaining some USDT is prudent given market uncertainties."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context reflects a mixed environment with a relatively high U.S. dollar index and volatility index, suggesting cautious market sentiment. The recent executive order by President Trump to include Bitcoin in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has created a buzz, but the lack of immediate purchases has led to increased hedging activity. Ethereum and Solana have seen increased put option activity, indicating bearish sentiment, although Ethereum has also experienced significant whale accumulation, suggesting some underlying bullish interest. Solana and Dogecoin have been negatively impacted by the reserve announcement, with Solana's co-founder expressing concerns about its inclusion in strategic reserves. Tether's recent freeze of funds on a Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — The strategic reserve news provides a long-term bullish narrative, but current market sentiment is cautious with increased hedging activity. Maintain moderate exposure.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite bearish sentiment and hedging, whale accumulation suggests potential upside. Slightly increase exposure to capture potential upward movement.

SOL: -0.1 — Negative sentiment from reserve exclusion and co-founder objections weigh on Solana. Reduce exposure slightly, given current holdings.

DOGE: -0.2 — Disappointment from reserve exclusion and ongoing legal issues suggest a bearish outlook. Reduce exposure moderately.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed market sentiment and increased volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT as a safe haven is prudent."
2025-03-07 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 23.37. The U.S. Dollar Index remains strong, which could weigh on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Recent news highlights the U.S. government's strategic move to include Bitcoin in its reserves, which has caused a ripple effect across the crypto market. Traders are hedging with puts in BTC and ETH, reflecting cautious sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have seen negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the reserve plan, while Tether's recent freeze of $27M USDT on a Russian exchange adds an element of regulatory risk.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — The inclusion of BTC in the U.S. reserve is a long-term positive, but current hedging activity suggests caution. Maintain a moderate positive stance due to its strategic importance.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite hedging activity, whale accumulation indicates underlying strength. Maintain a slight positive bias as social sentiment could reverse.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with high on-chain activity but negative sentiment from reserve exclusion. Hold position until clearer trends emerge.

DOGE: -0.2 — Negative sentiment from reserve exclusion and legal uncertainties suggest reducing exposure slightly, given current holdings.

USDT: +0.4 — With market uncertainty and hedging activity in major cryptos, a higher allocation to USDT provides stability and liquidity."
2025-03-07 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious, with traders seeking downside protection in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH following the U.S. government's strategic reserve announcement. This move has led to increased demand for put options, indicating a hedging strategy against potential downside risks. Despite the macroeconomic backdrop of relatively stable interest rates and a moderate volatility index, the crypto market is reacting to geopolitical developments and regulatory actions, such as Tether's freezing of USDT on a Russian exchange. The news has created mixed reactions across different assets, with BTC gaining some recognition as a strategic asset, while others like SOL and DOGE face uncertainties due to their exclusion from the reserve plan.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — While the strategic reserve announcement provides some long-term support, the immediate market reaction is cautious, with hedging activity suggesting potential downside risks.

ETH: +0.1 — Despite the hedging activity, whale accumulation indicates underlying bullish sentiment, though social sentiment remains low.

SOL: 0.0 — The exclusion from the primary reserve plan has created uncertainty, but the asset's on-chain activity remains strong, balancing the negative news impact.

DOGE: -0.2 — The disappointment from the reserve plan and legal uncertainties weigh on DOGE, suggesting a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of the current market uncertainty and hedging activities, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against potential volatility."
2025-03-07 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. The U.S. government's strategic move to include Bitcoin in its reserve has created a mixed reaction in the crypto market. While this recognition is a positive signal for Bitcoin, the lack of immediate purchases has led traders to seek downside protection through put options. Ethereum and Solana have seen similar hedging activity, although Ethereum's whale accumulation suggests underlying bullish sentiment. Solana's exclusion from the primary reserve has negatively impacted its sentiment. Dogecoin and other altcoins have been affected by the disappointment of not being included in the reserve plan. Meanwhile, Tether's action to freeze assets on a Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory risks.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The strategic reserve news provides a long-term bullish outlook, but the immediate market reaction is cautious with hedging activity. Maintain a moderate positive stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite short-term hedging, whale accumulation indicates potential for upward movement. The overall sentiment is mixed but slightly positive.

SOL: -0.1 — The exclusion from the primary reserve and public pushback from its co-founder have dampened sentiment. Maintain a cautious stance.

DOGE: 0.0 — The lack of inclusion in the reserve plan has caused disappointment, but no significant changes in technicals or sentiment warrant a neutral position.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market uncertainty and hedging activities, maintaining some exposure to stablecoins is prudent for risk management."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with the U.S. Dollar Index and gold prices indicating a cautious market sentiment. The recent U.S. decision to include Bitcoin in its strategic reserves has created a mixed reaction, with traders seeking downside protection through put options in BTC and ETH. This move has also negatively impacted other cryptocurrencies like SOL and DOGE, which were not included in the reserve strategy. Despite this, ETH has seen significant whale accumulation, suggesting a potential bullish outlook. Meanwhile, Tether's action against a Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges in the crypto space.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.3** — The inclusion of BTC in the U.S. strategic reserves is a long-term bullish signal, although short-term hedging activity suggests caution. Maintain a moderate positive stance.

**ETH: +0.2** — Despite short-term hedging, the increase in whale accumulation indicates underlying bullish sentiment. A cautious positive allocation is warranted.

**SOL: 0.0** — The negative sentiment from the U.S. reserve decision and internal disagreements within Solana's leadership suggest a neutral stance for now.

**DOGE: -0.2** — The exclusion from the reserve plan and legal uncertainties contribute to a slightly negative outlook, warranting a reduction in exposure.

**USDT: +0.1** — While generally stable, the regulatory action against a Russian exchange suggests a slight increase in demand for USDT as a safe haven amidst market uncertainties."
2025-03-07 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The recent macroeconomic context indicates a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility as reflected by the VIX. The U.S. government's strategic reserve announcement, focusing on Bitcoin, has created a mixed sentiment across the crypto market. Bitcoin's inclusion in a government reserve has increased hedging activities, as traders seek protection against potential downside risks. Ethereum and Solana have seen increased put option activities, reflecting cautious sentiment. Solana's exclusion from the primary reserve has negatively impacted its market sentiment, while Dogecoin and other altcoins have also reacted negatively to the reserve plan. Tether's recent freezing of assets linked to a Russian exchange has added a layer of regulatory risk, although its stable nature still provides a safe haven amidst uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve news, BTC shows bullish momentum and increased on-chain activity, suggesting moderate potential for gains.

ETH: +0.2 — Bullish momentum and whale accumulation indicate potential upside, although increased hedging suggests caution.

SOL: -0.1 — Negative sentiment from reserve exclusion and co-founder objections, but bullish momentum provides some support.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant positive catalysts and recent disappointment from reserve news keep DOGE neutral.

USDT: +0.1 — Stablecoin remains a safe harbor amidst regulatory concerns and market uncertainty, slightly increasing its relative attractiveness."
2025-03-07 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals across major cryptocurrencies, influenced by macroeconomic factors and recent news. Bitcoin is gaining strategic importance with the U.S. government's formal recognition of it as a reserve asset, although this has led to increased hedging activity. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing bearish sentiment due to the reserve strategy, with traders seeking downside protection. Dogecoin is also facing negative sentiment following its exclusion from the reserve plan. Tether remains stable but has been impacted by regulatory actions against a Russian exchange. Overall, the market shows signs of cautious optimism, with some assets experiencing bullish momentum, while others face headwinds from recent developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The U.S. government's recognition of Bitcoin as a reserve asset is a significant positive development, despite short-term hedging activity. Bullish momentum and on-chain activity support a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.2 — While there is bearish sentiment and increased put buying, whale accumulation suggests underlying bullish interest. The mixed signals warrant a cautious positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the negative impact from the reserve plan and public objections from the co-founder create uncertainty. A neutral stance is appropriate given the conflicting signals.

DOGE: -0.3 — The exclusion from the reserve plan and negative news sentiment weigh on Dogecoin. Reducing exposure is advisable given the current environment.

USDT: +0.1 — With market uncertainty and regulatory actions affecting other assets, maintaining a slight preference for stability in USDT is prudent, though not overly aggressive."
2025-03-07 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The market is currently experiencing mixed sentiment, with notable developments impacting various assets. The U.S. government's formal recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset has created a stir, leading to increased demand for downside protection through put options in BTC and ETH. This move has not been accompanied by new purchases, causing some uncertainty. Meanwhile, Solana and Dogecoin have faced negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the reserve plan, with Solana's co-founder publicly opposing the decision. Tether's recent action to freeze $27 million in USDT on a Russian exchange has also added to the market's cautious tone. Overall, while there is bullish momentum in several assets, the macroeconomic context and recent news have introduced a degree of caution among traders.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the hedging activity, the strategic reserve news and bullish momentum suggest a moderately positive outlook for BTC.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and bullish momentum provide a supportive backdrop, although the hedging activity tempers enthusiasm.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with bullish momentum but negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and co-founder objections.

DOGE: -0.2 — Negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and legal issues weigh on DOGE, warranting a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the cautious market environment and recent Tether actions, maintaining a stablecoin buffer is prudent, though not overly emphasized."

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The recent macroeconomic context shows a relatively stable environment with moderate volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 23.37. The U.S. government's formal recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset has created a mixed reaction in the crypto market. While Bitcoin has seen a surge in on-chain activity and price, traders have also been hedging with put options, indicating caution. Ethereum and Solana have experienced similar hedging activities, but Ethereum has seen significant whale accumulation, suggesting potential bullish sentiment. Solana's price was affected by its exclusion from the primary reserve, while Dogecoin faced disappointment due to its non-inclusion. Tether's recent action to freeze assets on a Russian exchange highlights ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The strategic reserve news and strong on-chain activity support a positive outlook, but hedging with puts suggests some caution.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite hedging activities, whale accumulation and a recent price increase indicate potential upside, though sentiment remains mixed.

SOL: +0.2 — Positive price momentum and high transaction activity are tempered by negative sentiment from reserve exclusion.

DOGE: 0.0 — Lack of significant positive developments and disappointment from reserve exclusion keep DOGE neutral.

USDT: -0.3 — With increased risk appetite and positive momentum in other assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is warranted."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market environment is characterized by a mixed sentiment, with significant developments impacting various cryptocurrencies. The U.S. government's decision to include Bitcoin in its strategic reserves has provided a bullish backdrop for BTC, although the lack of immediate purchasing has led to increased hedging activities. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing a similar trend, with traders seeking downside protection despite some bullish accumulation in ETH. Solana's exclusion from the primary reserve has caused some investor concern, while Dogecoin has been affected by the reserve plan's focus on Bitcoin. Tether's recent action to freeze assets linked to a Russian exchange has added a layer of caution in the stablecoin market. Overall, the market seems to be in a cautious yet slightly bullish phase, with some assets showing strong technical signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Despite the recent price drop, BTC's inclusion in the U.S. strategic reserves and strong technical indicators suggest a bullish outlook. The market's focus on BTC as a reserve asset supports a positive allocation.

ETH: +0.3 — While there is some downside protection activity, the bullish accumulation by whales and positive momentum signals indicate a moderate buy preference.

SOL: +0.2 — SOL's recent price increase and strong on-chain activity are positive, but concerns about its exclusion from the primary reserve limit the upside potential.

DOGE: 0.0 — DOGE's price remains stable with no significant changes in sentiment or technical indicators, warranting a neutral stance.

USDT: -0.4 — With the market showing some bullish tendencies and other assets presenting more attractive opportunities, reducing exposure to USDT is advisable to capitalize on potential gains in riskier assets."
2025-03-07 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with the U.S. Dollar Index and gold prices indicating a cautious sentiment. The recent announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has introduced volatility, particularly affecting BTC, ETH, and SOL. Traders are hedging with put options, indicating a preference for downside protection. Despite this, there is notable whale accumulation in ETH, suggesting underlying bullish sentiment. SOL and DOGE have experienced declines due to their exclusion from the reserve strategy, while USDT remains stable but faces regulatory challenges with the freezing of assets on a Russian exchange.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve news, BTC maintains bullish momentum and on-chain activity. However, hedging with puts suggests caution.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation indicates potential bullish sentiment, but the market is hedging against downside risks, warranting a cautious approach.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent declines due to reserve exclusion and public pushback from its co-founder suggest a need to reduce exposure slightly.

DOGE: -0.3 — Negative sentiment following the reserve plan and legal issues suggest reducing exposure, given current holdings.

USDT: +0.5 — In light of market volatility and hedging activity, maintaining a strong USDT position provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-03-07 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context suggests a mixed environment with relatively high volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 23.37, and a strong U.S. Dollar Index at 103.84. The recent news of the U.S. formalizing a strategic Bitcoin reserve has created a notable impact across the crypto market. While Bitcoin's recognition as a reserve asset is a significant development, it has led to increased hedging activity as traders seek downside protection. Ethereum and Solana are also experiencing similar hedging behavior, with Solana facing additional pressure due to its exclusion from the primary reserve. Dogecoin has been negatively impacted by the reserve plan, while Tether's recent action to freeze assets on a Russian exchange adds to the uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The strategic reserve news provides a long-term bullish signal, but the immediate market reaction shows caution with increased put options activity. Maintain a moderate positive stance due to potential future support.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite the dip in social sentiment, whale accumulation indicates underlying bullishness. The hedging activity suggests caution, but the accumulation trend supports a slightly positive outlook.

SOL: -0.1 — The exclusion from the primary reserve and public objections by its co-founder create uncertainty. While technical indicators remain positive, the news impact warrants a cautious approach.

DOGE: -0.3 — The disappointment from the reserve plan and legal challenges contribute to a negative sentiment. Given the current holdings, a reduction in exposure is prudent.

USDT: +0.1 — In light of the current volatility and hedging activity, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against potential market downturns."
2025-03-07 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The macroeconomic environment remains relatively stable, with moderate volatility as indicated by the VIX. Recent developments, such as the U.S. formalizing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, have introduced a new dynamic into the crypto market, causing traders to hedge with puts, particularly in BTC and ETH. This move has been met with mixed reactions across different assets, with SOL and DOGE experiencing declines due to their exclusion from the primary reserve strategy. Meanwhile, Tether's recent actions to freeze assets on a Russian exchange have caused some temporary disruptions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Despite the recent price volatility and hedging activity, the strategic reserve news provides a long-term bullish signal. On-chain activity remains strong, supporting a moderate buy signal.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and bullish momentum indicators suggest potential upside, although hedging activity indicates caution. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent declines due to reserve exclusion, SOL's technical indicators and on-chain activity remain strong, suggesting potential for recovery.

DOGE: 0.0 — The lack of inclusion in the reserve plan and mixed news sentiment keep DOGE neutral. No significant changes in technical indicators warrant a hold position.

USDT: -0.3 — With the current market sentiment showing a slight risk-on attitude, there's a moderate preference to reduce stablecoin holdings in favor of more volatile assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context indicates a mixed environment with relatively high volatility (VIX at 23.37) and a strong U.S. dollar (DXY at 103.84), which can exert pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The recent U.S. strategic reserve announcement, focusing on Bitcoin, has led to increased hedging activity in BTC and ETH, with traders seeking downside protection through put options. Despite this, there is notable whale accumulation in ETH, suggesting underlying bullish sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have faced negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the strategic reserve plan, while Tether's recent actions against a Russian exchange highlight ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the hedging activity, the strategic reserve news provides a long-term bullish signal. However, the lack of immediate buying and recent price volatility tempers enthusiasm.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and bullish momentum indicators suggest potential upside, despite hedging activity. The contrarian signal from low social sentiment also supports a positive outlook.

SOL: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent price volatility and negative sentiment from reserve exclusion. The technical indicators remain positive, but caution is warranted.

DOGE: -0.2 — Negative sentiment from reserve exclusion and recent price declines suggest reducing exposure, though technical indicators remain neutral.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current market volatility and mixed signals across other assets, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides stability and liquidity for potential future opportunities."
2025-03-07 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is mixed with a cautious tone due to macroeconomic uncertainties and recent developments. The U.S. government's strategic reserve announcement, focusing on Bitcoin, has led to increased hedging activities with short-dated puts across BTC, ETH, and SOL, indicating a defensive stance among traders. Despite the negative sentiment from the reserve announcement, there is notable whale accumulation in ETH, suggesting underlying bullish interest. SOL and DOGE have experienced declines due to their exclusion from the primary reserve strategy, while USDT faces regulatory challenges with the freezing of assets linked to a Russian exchange.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the hedging activity, the strategic reserve announcement provides long-term support, and on-chain activity remains strong.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation indicates potential bullish momentum, although short-term sentiment is cautious.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent price volatility and negative sentiment from the reserve announcement are balanced by ongoing bullish momentum indicators.

DOGE: -0.2 — Exclusion from the reserve plan and legal uncertainties weigh on sentiment, justifying a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the mixed market sentiment and increased hedging, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a safety net."
2025-03-07 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a mix of bearish and bullish signals. The recent announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has created a stir, leading to increased hedging activity with short-dated put options in BTC, ETH, and SOL. This indicates a defensive posture among traders, despite some bullish accumulation in ETH. SOL and DOGE have faced negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the reserve plan, while USDT has been impacted by regulatory actions against a Russian exchange. The macroeconomic environment, with high volatility and stable gold prices, suggests a cautious approach to risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the reserve news, BTC is experiencing mixed signals with hedging activity. However, its recognition as a reserve asset provides a long-term bullish outlook.

ETH: +0.2 — Bullish accumulation by whales and a contrarian signal from low social sentiment suggest potential upside, though hedging activity indicates caution.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite a recent price increase, negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and public pushback from its co-founder warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent declines and negative news sentiment, coupled with no significant positive catalysts, suggest a slight reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the mixed sentiment and macroeconomic volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a safety net against potential market downturns."
2025-03-07 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current market environment is characterized by a mix of cautious sentiment and strategic shifts following the U.S. government's announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This has led to increased hedging activity, particularly in BTC and ETH, as traders seek downside protection. Despite the bearish sentiment, there is notable accumulation in ETH by large holders, suggesting potential future bullishness. Solana and Dogecoin have faced negative sentiment due to their exclusion from the U.S. reserve strategy, while Tether's recent actions to freeze assets on a Russian exchange have added to the uncertainty. Overall, the market appears to be in a risk-off mode, with volatility heightened and investors seeking safety.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the bearish sentiment from the reserve announcement, BTC's recognition as a strategic asset by the U.S. government provides a long-term bullish outlook. However, the current hedging activity suggests caution.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are mixed, the significant accumulation by whales indicates potential for future upward movement, warranting a slight positive bias.

SOL: -0.1 — Negative sentiment from the reserve exclusion and public pushback by its co-founder dampens short-term prospects, though technical indicators remain somewhat supportive.

DOGE: -0.3 — The lack of inclusion in the reserve plan and recent legal challenges create a negative outlook, justifying a reduction in exposure.

USDT: +0.4 — In the current risk-off environment, maintaining higher stablecoin exposure is prudent to hedge against volatility and potential downturns in other assets."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed picture with high volatility (VIX at 23.37) and a strong U.S. Dollar Index (DXY at 103.84), suggesting cautious sentiment in broader markets. The recent strategic move by the U.S. to include Bitcoin in its reserves has not led to immediate bullish sentiment, as traders hedge with put options, indicating concerns about potential downside risks. Ethereum and Solana are experiencing similar hedging behavior, with Ethereum seeing increased whale accumulation despite low social sentiment. Solana and Dogecoin have been negatively impacted by their exclusion from the U.S. reserve strategy, causing price declines. Tether's recent freeze of $27 million linked to a sanctioned Russian exchange adds to the uncertainty, although it remains a safe haven in volatile conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the strategic reserve news, the lack of immediate bullish momentum and hedging activity suggests caution. However, the long-term recognition of BTC as a reserve asset is a positive signal.

ETH: +0.1 — Whale accumulation and contrarian signals from low social sentiment provide a slight positive outlook, but hedging activity and technicals remain neutral.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite buy signals from technical indicators, the negative sentiment from reserve exclusion and co-founder objections neutralize the potential upside.

DOGE: -0.1 — Recent declines due to exclusion from the reserve strategy and legal uncertainties suggest a cautious stance, but existing holdings limit further reduction.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current market volatility and the strategic reserve developments, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against potential downside risks."
2025-03-08 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility, with the VIX at 24.87, and a stable U.S. Dollar Index at 103.84. The recent easing of banking regulations in the U.S. is likely to boost institutional involvement in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which has been further supported by the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ethereum is experiencing investor caution as evidenced by significant withdrawals from ETFs, despite the easing of banking regulations. Solana had a brief rally driven by summit anticipation, but has since underperformed following unmet expectations. Dogecoin faces critical technical support levels, with potential for steep losses if breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations are strong bullish signals, suggesting increased institutional interest and support for Bitcoin.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite the easing of banking regulations, significant ETF outflows indicate investor caution, balancing the potential for institutional interest.

SOL: +0.3 — While recent summit-related optimism has faded, the earlier momentum and anticipation suggest some potential for recovery, albeit with caution due to recent underperformance.

DOGE: -0.3 — Current technical pressures and the risk of breaching key support levels warrant a cautious stance, with potential for further downside.

USDT: -0.5 — The easing of banking regulations and increased risk appetite suggest a rotation out of stablecoins, reducing the need for high USDT exposure."
2025-03-08 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic context indicates a mixed environment with elevated volatility (VIX at 24.87) and a relatively strong U.S. dollar (DXY at 103.84). The recent news highlights significant developments in the crypto space, particularly with the U.S. government's strategic move to establish a Bitcoin reserve and the easing of banking regulations for crypto services, which could bolster institutional interest in Bitcoin. Ethereum is experiencing investor caution with substantial withdrawals from ETFs, while Solana's recent rally was short-lived due to unmet expectations from a crypto summit. Dogecoin faces potential downside risk if key support levels are breached. Overall, the market sentiment is cautious with potential for increased institutional involvement in Bitcoin, while altcoins face mixed signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — The strategic reserve news and easing banking regulations are positive for Bitcoin, suggesting potential institutional inflows. Despite current technicals showing no strong buy signals, the long-term outlook is favorable.

ETH: 0.0 — Recent ETF outflows indicate caution among investors, and technical indicators do not suggest a clear direction. Holding current positions seems prudent until clearer signals emerge.

SOL: -0.2 — Despite a recent rally, Solana's performance has been volatile with a sharp decline post-summit. The lack of strong technical signals and recent underperformance suggest a cautious approach.

DOGE: -0.3 — With key support levels under threat and no strong buy signals, reducing exposure is advisable to mitigate potential downside risk.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential volatility in the crypto market, maintaining a higher USDT allocation provides a buffer and flexibility to capitalize on future opportunities."
2025-03-08 02:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by relatively high volatility, as indicated by the VIX, and a stable U.S. Dollar Index, which suggests a cautious risk sentiment in traditional markets. Bitcoin has seen regulatory developments with the U.S. government establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which could bolster institutional confidence. Ethereum is experiencing investor caution with significant outflows from ETFs, reflecting a mixed sentiment. Solana has shown volatility with a recent surge followed by a decline, indicating speculative trading around recent news events. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, with potential for significant downside if breached. Overall, the market sentiment is mixed, with some bullish signals for Bitcoin due to regulatory developments, while other assets face uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve by the U.S. government is a significant positive development, potentially increasing institutional confidence and demand.

ETH: -0.3 — Recent outflows from Ethereum ETFs indicate investor caution, and technical indicators do not support a bullish stance at this time.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, Solana's previous momentum and anticipation around the crypto summit provide a moderate positive outlook, though caution is warranted.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin is at a critical support level, and while no immediate action is required, the risk of a significant drop necessitates a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed market sentiment and potential for increased volatility, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against downside risks."
2025-03-08 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a relatively stable backdrop with a moderate U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility as indicated by the VIX. The recent news and market data suggest a mixed sentiment across cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is seeing potential institutional support due to regulatory changes, which could be a positive long-term driver. Ethereum is experiencing investor caution with significant outflows from ETFs, indicating a potential short-term bearish sentiment. Solana experienced a brief rally due to summit anticipation but faced a sell-off post-event, reflecting volatility and sensitivity to news. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, with potential for significant downside if breached. USDT remains stable with no significant news, indicating its role as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Institutional support and regulatory easing are positive long-term drivers, although current technicals are neutral. The strategic reserve news could bolster confidence.

ETH: -0.3 — Significant outflows from ETFs suggest caution among investors, and technical indicators do not show bullish momentum. The sentiment is currently bearish.

SOL: +0.2 — Despite recent volatility, the anticipation of inclusion in strategic reserves and previous momentum suggest a cautious optimism, though tempered by post-summit disappointment.

DOGE: -0.1 — At a critical support level, DOGE faces potential downside risk. Current holdings should be monitored closely, but no immediate action is warranted unless support breaks.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of mixed sentiment across other assets and elevated market volatility, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a buffer against potential downside risks."

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of regulatory developments and technical signals. Bitcoin has received a boost from U.S. regulatory changes, potentially increasing institutional involvement, while Ethereum is experiencing some investor caution as evidenced by significant ETF outflows. Solana has seen a recent rally due to anticipation of inclusion in strategic reserves, but this momentum has been tempered by broader altcoin underperformance post-summit. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, with potential for significant downside if breached. The macroeconomic context, with relatively high volatility and stable dollar index, suggests a mixed environment for risk assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.6 — Positive regulatory news and strategic reserve developments are supportive, despite mixed technical indicators. The potential for increased institutional involvement enhances its attractiveness.

ETH: -0.1 — Recent ETF outflows indicate caution among investors, and technical indicators remain neutral. Maintain a slight reduction in exposure due to mixed sentiment.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite recent underperformance, the anticipation of strategic reserve inclusion and recent price rally provide a moderately positive outlook.

DOGE: -0.3 — Critical support level is under pressure, and the risk of a significant drop if breached warrants a cautious approach. Reduce exposure slightly.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market environment and potential volatility, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin position provides a buffer against downside risks."
2025-03-08 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by moderate volatility and a stable U.S. dollar index, with no immediate macroeconomic pressures suggesting drastic shifts in risk sentiment. The recent news of the U.S. establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations for crypto services is likely to bolster institutional interest in Bitcoin, providing a supportive backdrop for BTC. However, Ethereum has seen significant outflows from ETFs, indicating investor caution despite underlying interest. Solana experienced a brief rally due to summit anticipation but has since underperformed following unmet expectations. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, with potential for significant downside if breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst mixed market signals.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive institutional developments and strategic reserve news provide strong support for Bitcoin, making it an attractive asset in the current environment.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite recent outflows from ETFs, the lack of significant negative news and stable technical indicators suggest a hold position for Ethereum.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent underperformance following unmet summit expectations and broader altcoin weakness suggest a cautious approach, with a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.5 — Approaching critical support levels with potential for significant downside if breached, warranting a reduction in exposure to mitigate risk.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the mixed sentiment and potential for volatility, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against market fluctuations and allows for flexibility in future reallocations."
2025-03-08 06:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by a relatively high U.S. dollar index and elevated volatility as indicated by the VIX, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. The recent news highlights a significant development with the U.S. government establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which could bolster institutional confidence in Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Ethereum faces investor caution as evidenced by substantial withdrawals from ETFs. Solana experienced a brief rally driven by anticipation of the crypto summit, but this was followed by a decline as expectations were not met. Dogecoin is under pressure with key technical support levels being tested, while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The establishment of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve is a strong institutional endorsement, and easing banking regulations are likely to boost institutional involvement, making Bitcoin an attractive asset in the current environment.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite underlying interest, significant ETF withdrawals indicate investor caution, and technical indicators do not show a clear buy signal, warranting a cautious stance.

SOL: +0.2 — Although Solana experienced a decline post-summit, the earlier rally suggests some underlying interest. However, the broader altcoin slump tempers enthusiasm, leading to a moderate positive score.

DOGE: -0.5 — With key support levels under threat and the potential for significant downside, reducing exposure to Dogecoin is prudent given the current technical risks.

USDT: +0.3 — In a volatile market environment with mixed signals across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides a stable hedge and liquidity option."
2025-03-08 07:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a slight bearish tilt. Macroeconomic indicators show a stable environment with moderate volatility, but recent market data indicates a lack of strong bullish signals across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's recent news of a strategic reserve by the U.S. government could potentially boost its long-term appeal, but short-term technical indicators remain neutral. Ethereum is experiencing significant outflows from ETFs, suggesting investor caution despite easing banking regulations that may support institutional involvement. Solana experienced a brief rally due to summit anticipation, but quickly declined as expectations were unmet. Dogecoin is under pressure with critical support levels being tested, while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The strategic reserve news provides a long-term bullish outlook, but current technicals are neutral. Maintain a moderate positive stance due to potential institutional interest.

ETH: 0.0 — Despite easing regulations, significant ETF outflows indicate caution. Hold position given mixed signals and lack of strong momentum.

SOL: -0.2 — Recent rally was short-lived and followed by a decline. Reduce exposure slightly due to underperformance and unmet summit expectations.

DOGE: -0.3 — Critical support levels are under threat, increasing downside risk. Reduce exposure to mitigate potential steep losses.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the cautious market sentiment and lack of strong buy signals in other assets, maintain higher stablecoin exposure for risk management."

Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows mixed signals with a relatively high U.S. Dollar Index and elevated volatility as indicated by the VIX, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. The recent news of the U.S. establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations for crypto is a significant positive development for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, potentially increasing institutional involvement. However, Ethereum has seen substantial outflows from ETFs, indicating investor caution. Solana experienced a brief rally driven by summit expectations, but this was followed by a sell-off as the summit failed to meet expectations. Dogecoin is under pressure, with critical support levels being tested, while Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — Positive news regarding the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations suggest increased institutional interest, despite mixed technical indicators.

ETH: 0.0 — While there is underlying interest, the significant outflows from ETFs indicate caution among investors, balancing the score to neutral.

SOL: -0.2 — The post-summit sell-off and broader altcoin slump suggest caution, despite earlier momentum-driven gains.

DOGE: -0.3 — With critical support levels under threat, there is potential for further downside, warranting a cautious stance.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the mixed sentiment and increased volatility, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin allocation provides a defensive buffer."
2025-03-08 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with significant macroeconomic developments impacting the crypto space. The U.S. government's decision to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the easing of banking regulations for crypto services are likely to boost institutional engagement and support Bitcoin's value. However, Ethereum faces investor caution as evidenced by substantial ETF outflows, indicating profit-taking amid volatility. Solana experienced a brief rally due to summit-related optimism but has since underperformed, reflecting broader altcoin weakness. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, with potential for significant downside if breached. In this environment, USDT remains a stable option for those seeking to hedge against volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and relaxed banking regulations are strong bullish signals, suggesting increased institutional interest and long-term support.

ETH: -0.3 — Despite underlying interest, significant ETF outflows indicate investor caution, and technical indicators do not suggest immediate upside potential.

SOL: +0.2 — While recent summit-related optimism has faded, Solana's previous momentum and potential for recovery warrant a modest positive outlook.

DOGE: -0.5 — With DOGE nearing critical support and potential for steep losses if breached, reducing exposure is prudent given the current technical risks.

USDT: +0.4 — In light of market volatility and mixed sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility for future repositioning."
2025-03-08 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is mixed with a slight bearish tilt, as evidenced by the recent price declines across major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Macroeconomic indicators show a relatively stable environment, but the high VIX suggests increased market volatility. The U.S. government's move to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the easing of banking regulations for crypto services are positive developments that could boost institutional involvement in the crypto market. However, the recent withdrawal of significant funds from Ethereum ETFs and the underperformance of SOL following the crypto summit indicate caution among investors. DOGE is at a critical support level, and a breach could lead to significant losses. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with bullish momentum, suggesting a preference for safety amid uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and eased banking regulations are positive for BTC, despite recent price declines. The potential for increased institutional involvement supports a moderate buy signal.

ETH: 0.0 — Mixed signals with recent ETF withdrawals indicating caution, but underlying interest remains. Hold position as market sentiment is unclear.

SOL: -0.3 — Recent underperformance following the summit and broader altcoin slump suggest reducing exposure. The earlier rally has lost momentum.

DOGE: -0.5 — Approaching critical support level with risk of significant downside if breached. Reduce exposure due to heightened risk.

USDT: +0.3 — Stable with bullish momentum, serving as a safe haven amid market uncertainty. Increase exposure to balance risk."
2025-03-08 11:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows a mixed picture with stable interest rates, a moderate U.S. dollar index, and high gold prices, indicating a cautious investment climate. The recent easing of banking regulations in the U.S. is likely to increase institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as banks are now cleared to engage in crypto services. However, the market sentiment is cautious, as indicated by the withdrawal of significant funds from Ethereum ETFs and the underperformance of Solana following the White House crypto summit. Dogecoin is facing critical technical support levels, which could lead to significant downside if breached. Overall, the market appears to be in a consolidation phase with mixed signals across different assets.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.5 — The strategic Bitcoin reserve news and easing banking regulations are positive for Bitcoin, suggesting potential institutional inflows. Despite a lack of strong technical buy signals, the macro developments provide a supportive backdrop.

ETH: 0.0 — The withdrawal from Ethereum ETFs indicates caution among investors, and while there is some bullish momentum, the overall sentiment remains mixed. Holding current positions seems prudent.

SOL: -0.2 — Despite a recent price surge, Solana's underperformance post-summit and the broader altcoin slump suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly may be wise given the recent volatility.

DOGE: -0.3 — With DOGE approaching critical support levels and the risk of a significant drop if breached, it is prudent to reduce exposure to mitigate potential losses.

USDT: +0.2 — In a mixed market environment with some bearish signals, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in USDT provides a buffer against volatility and allows for flexibility in capital deployment."
2025-03-08 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with significant developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The U.S. government's decision to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the easing of banking regulations for crypto services are likely to boost institutional involvement in Bitcoin, providing a supportive backdrop. Ethereum, however, faces mixed sentiment as substantial withdrawals from ETFs indicate investor caution despite recent price increases. Solana experienced a short-term rally due to anticipation of the crypto summit but has since underperformed amid broader altcoin weakness. Dogecoin faces critical technical support challenges, with a potential for steep losses if key levels are breached. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing of banking regulations are strong bullish signals, likely to increase institutional interest and support price appreciation.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, the underlying bullish momentum and price increase suggest a cautiously positive outlook, though investor caution remains.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent underperformance and fading summit optimism suggest a cautious stance, though the asset remains attractive for potential rebounds.

DOGE: -0.5 — Critical technical support is under pressure, and a breach could lead to significant losses. Reducing exposure is prudent given the downside risk.

USDT: -0.3 — While serving as a stable asset, the overall bullish sentiment and potential capital rotation into riskier assets suggest a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings."

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin showing signs of bullish momentum and increased institutional interest following regulatory changes in the U.S. Ethereum, despite recent outflows from ETFs, maintains underlying interest, although investors are cautious. Solana experienced a brief rally driven by anticipation of inclusion in a strategic reserve, but this was followed by a sell-off as expectations were not met. Dogecoin is facing critical technical support levels, with potential for significant downside if breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and regulatory support are boosting confidence in Bitcoin, coupled with bullish momentum indicators.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum's price momentum and potential breakout above the Bollinger Bands suggest a cautiously positive outlook.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent sell-off following unmet summit expectations and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a neutral to slightly negative stance.

DOGE: -0.5 — Critical support levels are under threat, and a breach could lead to significant downside, warranting reduced exposure.

USDT: -0.3 — With increasing risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, a slight reduction in stablecoin holdings is justified."
2025-03-08 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with bullish momentum observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite some recent profit-taking in Ethereum ETFs. The macroeconomic backdrop, including easing banking regulations for crypto, supports increased institutional involvement, particularly in Bitcoin. Solana experienced a brief rally due to anticipation around the crypto summit but faced a sell-off post-event, reflecting broader altcoin weakness. Dogecoin is under technical pressure, with analysts warning of potential steep declines if key support levels are breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market fluctuations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong bullish momentum and positive regulatory news support increased allocation. The strategic Bitcoin reserve development is a significant long-term positive.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and a potential breakout pattern, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent sell-off post-summit indicates caution; however, the prior rally suggests some underlying interest. Maintain a slightly reduced position due to broader altcoin weakness.

DOGE: -0.5 — Technical pressure and risk of significant downside if support fails. Reduce exposure to mitigate potential losses.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in BTC and ETH, reduce stablecoin holdings to allocate more capital to growth assets."
2025-03-08 15:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with a mix of bullish and bearish signals across different assets. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum with increased institutional involvement following regulatory easing, and the U.S. government's strategic Bitcoin reserve initiative could further bolster its appeal. Ethereum, despite recent withdrawals from ETFs, maintains bullish momentum, suggesting underlying interest remains strong. Solana saw a temporary surge due to summit anticipation but faced a sell-off as expectations were not met. Dogecoin is under pressure with critical support levels being tested, indicating potential for significant downside if breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amidst mixed market conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional interest and strategic reserve news provide a bullish outlook, supported by positive momentum and on-chain activity.

ETH: +0.5 — Despite ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and technical signals, suggesting continued interest and potential for recovery.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent sell-off post-summit indicates caution, but underlying momentum and previous optimism suggest potential stabilization.

DOGE: -0.3 — Critical support levels are being tested, and the risk of a significant drop warrants caution in maintaining current exposure.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the mixed market signals, maintaining a slightly higher USDT allocation provides a buffer against volatility while allowing for opportunistic reallocation."
2025-03-08 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant developments in regulatory and institutional support for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing positive momentum, bolstered by the U.S. government's decision to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the easing of banking regulations, which could increase institutional involvement. Ethereum is facing mixed sentiment, with substantial withdrawals from ETFs indicating investor caution despite underlying interest. Solana initially surged due to summit anticipation but faced a sell-off as expectations were not met. Dogecoin is under pressure, with critical support levels being tested, which could lead to significant declines if breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and regulatory developments provide a bullish backdrop. Positive momentum and on-chain activity further support an increased allocation.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent ETF withdrawals, bullish technical signals and underlying interest suggest a cautious buy, but with some reservation due to recent profit-taking.

SOL: -0.1 — Recent sell-off post-summit and lack of bullish technical signals suggest a cautious approach, maintaining current exposure without increasing allocation.

DOGE: -0.5 — Technical support is under pressure, and a potential breach could lead to significant losses. Reducing exposure is prudent given the bearish outlook.

USDT: +0.1 — While risk appetite is increasing, maintaining a slight allocation to USDT provides a buffer against potential market volatility, especially given the mixed signals across other assets."

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment shows moderate volatility with a VIX of 24.87, indicating some market uncertainty. The U.S. Dollar Index remains stable, and the S&P 500 is relatively high, suggesting a mixed risk sentiment. Bitcoin news is notably positive, with the U.S. government establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations for crypto, potentially boosting institutional interest. Ethereum faces some investor caution with significant ETF withdrawals, while Solana experiences volatility due to summit-related news. Dogecoin is at a critical technical support level, and Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

**BTC: +0.8** — The strategic Bitcoin reserve news and eased banking regulations are highly supportive, coupled with bullish momentum signals and increased on-chain activity.

**ETH: +0.2** — Despite ETF withdrawals, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and a buy trend signal, suggesting underlying strength despite recent caution.

**SOL: -0.1** — Recent summit-related volatility and underperformance among altcoins suggest caution, although previous momentum indicates potential for recovery.

**DOGE: -0.3** — Approaching a critical support level with potential for significant downside if breached, warranting a cautious stance.

**USDT: 0.0** — Stablecoin remains neutral as a safe haven, with no significant news or market shifts affecting its status."
2025-03-08 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with some bullish signals, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The recent U.S. policy changes allowing banks to engage more freely in crypto services are expected to boost institutional involvement, particularly benefiting Bitcoin. Ethereum is experiencing some profit-taking, reflected in large ETF withdrawals, but maintains underlying interest. Solana showed volatility with a brief surge followed by a decline post-summit, indicating a mixed sentiment. Dogecoin is under technical pressure, with key support levels being tested, while Tether remains stable with no significant news affecting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations are strong bullish signals, likely to increase institutional demand and support price stability.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF withdrawals, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and interest, supported by technical indicators showing potential breakouts.

SOL: +0.1 — Recent volatility suggests caution, but the asset has shown resilience and potential for recovery following the summit-driven sell-off.

DOGE: -0.2 — With critical support levels under threat, there is a risk of further downside, warranting a cautious approach given current holdings.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and potential capital rotation into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin exposure seems prudent."
2025-03-08 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The macroeconomic context shows a mixed environment with high volatility (VIX at 24.87) and a strong U.S. dollar (DXY at 103.84), which could pressure risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is experiencing bullish momentum, supported by significant news of the U.S. establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations, which could increase institutional involvement. Ethereum shows bullish technical signals, but recent ETF outflows indicate caution among investors. Solana has seen recent volatility due to summit-related news, while Dogecoin is at a critical support level with potential downside risk. Tether remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support and positive regulatory news create a favorable environment for Bitcoin, despite the absence of a clear trend signal.

ETH: +0.3 — While technical indicators are bullish, recent ETF outflows suggest caution. However, the overall market environment remains supportive.

SOL: +0.1 — Recent summit-related volatility has subsided, but the lack of a clear trend signal and broader altcoin weakness suggest a cautious approach.

DOGE: -0.3 — At a critical support level with potential for significant downside if breached, warranting a reduction in exposure.

USDT: -0.5 — As risk appetite increases, there is a preference to rotate capital into more volatile assets, reducing stablecoin holdings."
2025-03-08 20:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The U.S. government's move to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the easing of banking regulations are likely to bolster institutional confidence in crypto, particularly Bitcoin. Ethereum has seen significant outflows from ETFs, indicating profit-taking and investor caution despite underlying interest. Solana experienced a short-term rally driven by anticipation of inclusion in the U.S. reserve, but this was followed by a decline as expectations were not met. Dogecoin faces critical technical support levels, with potential for steep losses if breached. Tether remains stable with no significant news.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — The establishment of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and easing banking regulations are strong bullish signals, suggesting increased institutional involvement and confidence in Bitcoin.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and a buy signal, indicating potential for recovery and continued interest.

SOL: +0.1 — While Solana experienced a rally followed by a decline, the overall momentum remains positive, albeit with caution due to recent volatility.

DOGE: -0.1 — Dogecoin is at a critical support level, and while momentum is slightly positive, the risk of a significant drop warrants caution.

USDT: -0.5 — With increased risk appetite and positive developments in the crypto market, capital rotation out of stablecoins like USDT is likely as investors seek higher returns."
2025-03-08 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with bullish momentum observed across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite some volatility. The recent U.S. policy changes, including the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and eased banking regulations, are likely to boost institutional involvement in the crypto space, providing a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin. Ethereum, however, faces some investor caution as evidenced by significant withdrawals from ETFs, indicating profit-taking amidst volatility. Solana experienced a short-term rally driven by anticipation of the White House crypto summit, but the subsequent sell-off highlights the market's sensitivity to news events. Dogecoin is under pressure with critical technical support levels being tested, while Tether remains stable with no significant news impacting its status.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Strong institutional support from U.S. policy changes and bullish momentum signals make Bitcoin an attractive asset to increase exposure.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and buy signals, warranting a moderate increase in allocation.

SOL: +0.1 — Recent price volatility and mixed news sentiment suggest a cautious approach, though the bullish momentum supports a slight increase.

DOGE: 0.0 — With critical support levels being tested and no clear bullish signals, maintaining current exposure is prudent.

USDT: -0.5 — Given the bullish sentiment across other assets and the potential for capital rotation into riskier assets, reducing stablecoin holdings is advisable."

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with bullish momentum signals across most major cryptocurrencies, despite some mixed news and technical indicators. Bitcoin's strategic reserve announcement and easing of banking regulations are likely to boost institutional interest, providing a supportive backdrop for BTC. Ethereum faces some investor caution as evidenced by significant ETF withdrawals, though its underlying interest remains. Solana experienced a brief rally driven by anticipation of the crypto summit but has since faced a sell-off, reflecting broader altcoin volatility. Dogecoin is under pressure, with critical support levels being tested, while USDT remains stable without significant news but serves as a safe haven amid uncertainty.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive institutional developments and strong momentum suggest a favorable environment for Bitcoin. The strategic reserve news could enhance long-term value perception.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite ETF outflows, Ethereum maintains bullish momentum and technical buy signals, warranting a moderate positive stance.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent volatility and underperformance post-summit suggest caution. Current signals do not strongly support increased allocation.

DOGE: -0.2 — With critical support levels under threat and no significant positive catalysts, reducing exposure is prudent given the potential for steep declines.

USDT: -0.5 — As market sentiment leans towards cautious optimism, reducing stablecoin holdings to allocate more capital to risk assets is advisable."
2025-03-08 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### 3. News Summaries
**Bitcoin (BTC)**

- **U.S. launches ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve’ via executive order**
   President Trump signed an order to channel seized bitcoin into a permanent national reserve, creating a “Digital Asset Stockpile” to include non‑BTC crypto. Main takeaway: U.S. will hold government‑acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, with agencies required to inventory and potentially accrue more without taxpayer funds.
- **Banks cleared to engage in crypto post-White House summit**
   The OCC announced that U.S. banks no longer need special permission to offer crypto services following the Digital Asset Summit, marking a rollback of earlier restrictions. Takeaway: Dramatic easing of banking regulations should boost institutional involvement in crypto, including Bitcoin.

**Ethereum (ETH)**

- **$400M pulled from Ethereum ETFs amid volatility**
   Investors withdrew over $400 million from Ethereum exchange‑traded funds over two weeks despite earlier strength. Main takeaway: Profit‑taking indicates investor caution even as underlying interest remains evident.
- No further ETH‑specific news found on that date

**Solana (SOL)**

- **SOL surges on momentum ahead of crypto summit**
   SOL climbed ~9% intraday from around $137 to $149 as anticipation built before Trump’s White House crypto summit. Takeaway: Optimism driven by expectation of reserve inclusion triggered a short‑term rally.
- **SOL underperforms amid broader altcoin slump**
   SOL declined more sharply than Bitcoin following the disappointing summit; XRP and ADA also dropped as expectations were not met. Takeaway: Summit hype faded quickly, triggering sell‑off among major altcoins.

**Dogecoin (DOGE)**

- **Support under pressure — DOGE encroaching $0.19 level**
   Analysts warned that if DOGE falls below $0.19, it could plummet to as low as $0.015. Takeaway: Key technical support is critical; a breach could trigger steep losses.

**Tether (USDT)**

- No significant news found for USDT on that day

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with significant developments in regulatory and institutional involvement in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is buoyed by the U.S. government's strategic reserve initiative and eased banking regulations, which could lead to increased institutional participation. Ethereum faces mixed sentiment as substantial withdrawals from ETFs indicate investor caution despite underlying interest. Solana experienced a brief rally driven by summit anticipation but underperformed following unmet expectations. Dogecoin is under technical pressure, with a critical support level in focus. USDT remains stable with no significant news, serving as a safe haven amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.8 — Positive regulatory news and institutional involvement are strong tailwinds, alongside bullish momentum signals.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite ETF outflows, bullish technical indicators and underlying interest suggest moderate upside potential.

SOL: 0.0 — Recent volatility and post-summit disappointment balance out previous optimism, leading to a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.2 — Technical vulnerability at a key support level suggests caution, though current holdings are minimal.

USDT: -0.5 — Favorable macro conditions and positive sentiment in major cryptocurrencies reduce the need for stablecoin exposure."
2025-03-09 00:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is marked by uncertainty, with high volatility and economic concerns impacting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, driven by macroeconomic pressures and a recent sell-off, indicating bearish sentiment. Ethereum, however, shows signs of potential recovery with whale accumulation suggesting a possible rally, despite its current consolidation phase. Solana continues to struggle with a significant year-to-date decline, although developments in its ecosystem may offer future support. Dogecoin faces bearish pressure with a significant monthly loss, while Tether remains stable with increased adoption and no adverse events reported.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the recent sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest a cautious approach, reducing exposure to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.6 — Whale accumulation and technical consolidation indicate potential for a rally, making ETH relatively attractive in the current environment.

SOL: -0.2 — Continued year-to-date decline and lack of strong buy signals suggest maintaining a cautious stance, although ecosystem developments could provide future upside.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed forecasts and recent significant losses warrant a neutral stance, with no clear signals for increased allocation.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment in other assets, maintaining a slightly higher exposure to USDT provides a hedge against volatility."
2025-03-09 01:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a bearish tilt due to macroeconomic uncertainties, including concerns over tariffs and Federal Reserve policies, which have led to a broad sell-off in risk assets. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, testing its 200-day moving average, while Ethereum shows signs of potential accumulation by whales, indicating a possible rally. Solana continues to face challenges despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline over the past month. Tether remains stable, with its use cases expanding through new integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, recent macroeconomic concerns and a significant price drop suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and bullish momentum indicate potential for a rally, making it relatively attractive in the current environment.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, ongoing challenges and a significant YTD decline warrant a neutral stance until clearer positive signals emerge.

DOGE: -0.2 — Continued bearish pressure and a significant monthly loss suggest reducing exposure, although the current holding is minimal.

USDT: +0.2 — Given the current macroeconomic uncertainty and bearish sentiment in risk assets, maintaining a slightly higher allocation in stablecoins is prudent for capital preservation."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a bearish tilt, influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, testing its 2025 lows, which reflects broader economic fragility. Ethereum, however, shows signs of potential recovery with whale accumulation, suggesting a possible rally. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin faces strong bearish pressure with a significant monthly loss. Tether remains stable, with increased integration and adoption but no significant changes in its market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, the recent sharp drop and macroeconomic concerns suggest caution. Reducing exposure slightly to mitigate risk.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and a promising technical range indicate potential for a rebound. Increasing exposure to capitalize on possible upward movement.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite positive ecosystem developments, the overall bearish trend and significant YTD loss warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.5 — Persistent bearish pressure and significant monthly losses suggest reducing exposure to avoid further downside risk.

USDT: +0.3 — In light of market uncertainty and bearish conditions, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-03-09 03:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a bearish tilt due to macroeconomic uncertainties and recent sell-offs. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, influenced by broader economic concerns and a weekend sell-off, pushing it towards its 200-day moving average. Ethereum shows potential for a rally due to whale accumulation, although it remains in a consolidation phase. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, with its price down significantly year-to-date. Dogecoin has faced a sharp decline, with mixed forecasts around its support levels. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with increased integration and no major disruptions reported.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, recent news highlights significant downside risks and macroeconomic pressures, warranting a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation suggests potential for a rally, and technical consolidation indicates a promising range for growth.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum signals, the overall negative YTD performance and lack of strong buy signals suggest a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.1 — Continued bearish pressure and recent sharp declines suggest reducing exposure, though current holdings are minimal.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the macro uncertainty and recent market volatility, maintaining a higher stablecoin allocation for risk management is prudent."
2025-03-09 04:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a bearish tilt, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies affecting risk assets. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, nearing its 200-day moving average, indicating broader economic concerns. Ethereum shows signs of potential recovery with whale accumulation, although it remains in a technical consolidation phase. Solana continues to face challenges despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin is under significant bearish pressure with a substantial monthly loss. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with increased integration and adoption, reflecting its role as a safe haven in uncertain times.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish technical indicators, recent price declines and macroeconomic concerns suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly to manage risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and technical consolidation around $2.2K provide a promising outlook. Increase exposure moderately.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the lack of a clear buy signal and ongoing YTD decline warrant a neutral stance.

DOGE: -0.5 — Significant monthly losses and bearish sentiment indicate a need to reduce exposure, especially given current holdings.

USDT: +0.5 — With market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty, maintaining higher USDT exposure provides a safe haven and liquidity buffer."
2025-03-09 05:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is cautious with a bearish tilt, influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Fed policy, which have led to a recent sell-off in Bitcoin and other risk assets. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, nearing its 200-day moving average, while Ethereum shows potential for a rally due to whale accumulation despite its current technical consolidation. Solana continues to face challenges despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin remains under pressure with significant monthly losses. Tether remains stable with increased adoption and integration but no significant new developments.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum indicators, recent macroeconomic concerns and a significant price drop suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation and a promising technical range indicate potential for a rally. Maintain a moderate positive stance to capture potential upside.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite bullish momentum, the overall year-to-date decline and macro uncertainty suggest a neutral position until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: -0.1 — Continued bearish pressure and significant monthly losses warrant a slight reduction in exposure, although current holdings are minimal.

USDT: +0.1 — Given the macroeconomic uncertainty and recent market volatility, maintaining a slightly higher stablecoin exposure provides a buffer against further downside risks."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a mix of bearish and bullish signals. Bitcoin is experiencing pressure from macroeconomic uncertainties, such as tariffs and Fed policy, which have led to a significant drop. Ethereum shows potential for a rally due to whale accumulation, although it remains in a technical consolidation phase. Solana, despite a liquidity boost, continues to face challenges with a significant year-to-date decline. Dogecoin is under bearish pressure with a substantial monthly loss, although it is hovering around a support level that might prompt a short-term bounce. Tether remains stable with increased adoption and integration, indicating a safe haven preference in uncertain conditions.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite some bullish technical indicators, macroeconomic concerns and recent price drops suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation and potential for a rally make ETH relatively attractive, even amidst technical consolidation.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite some positive developments, the overall decline and market conditions suggest a neutral stance until clearer signals emerge.

DOGE: 0.0 — While there is potential for a short-term bounce, the overall bearish trend and low activity warrant a hold position.

USDT: +0.3 — Given the macroeconomic uncertainty and recent market volatility, maintaining a higher stablecoin exposure is prudent to manage risk."
2025-03-09 08:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current macroeconomic environment is marked by uncertainty, with risk assets experiencing pressure due to broader economic concerns such as tariffs and Fed policy. Bitcoin has recently experienced a significant drop, reflecting this macro fragility. Ethereum shows signs of potential accumulation by large holders, suggesting a possible future rally, although it remains in a technical consolidation phase. Solana continues to face challenges despite liquidity injections, while Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline over the past month, with bearish pressure persisting. Tether remains stable, with increased integration and use-case expansion, indicating its continued role as a safe haven during market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Recent price declines and macroeconomic uncertainty suggest caution. Current holdings should be slightly reduced to manage risk.

ETH: +0.2 — Accumulation by whales indicates potential for a rally, but technical consolidation warrants a cautious approach. Slight increase in allocation.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite positive developments in the ecosystem, the overall bearish trend and year-to-date decline suggest maintaining current exposure without changes.

DOGE: -0.5 — Significant monthly losses and ongoing bearish sentiment justify reducing exposure to manage downside risk.

USDT: +0.6 — Given the current market volatility and bearish sentiment across risk assets, maintaining or slightly increasing stablecoin holdings provides a hedge against further declines."
2025-03-09 09:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with macroeconomic uncertainties impacting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, influenced by broader economic concerns such as tariffs and Fed policy, pushing it toward its 200-day moving average. Ethereum, however, shows signs of potential recovery due to whale accumulation, despite being in a technical consolidation phase. Solana continues to face challenges with a year-to-date decline, although developments like the Solaxy L2 presale aim to address network congestion. Dogecoin remains under bearish pressure, with significant monthly losses and mixed forecasts around its support level. Tether maintains stability, with recent integrations expanding its use cases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sell-off and macroeconomic concerns suggest caution. With BTC already in the portfolio, reducing exposure is prudent given the bearish sentiment and technical breakdown.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent consolidation, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rally. Maintaining a moderate positive outlook aligns with current portfolio holdings.

SOL: 0.0 — While there are positive developments in the ecosystem, the overall bearish trend and significant YTD decline warrant a neutral stance for now.

DOGE: 0.0 — Continued bearish pressure and lack of significant positive catalysts suggest holding the current minimal position without further allocation.

USDT: +0.7 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment across other assets, increasing exposure to USDT provides a safe haven and liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-03-09 10:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with significant downward pressure on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, influenced by broader macroeconomic concerns such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies, pushing it towards its 200-day moving average. Ethereum, despite recent whale accumulation, is in a technical consolidation phase, indicating cautious optimism. Solana and Dogecoin are also facing downward trends, with Solana struggling despite liquidity injections and Dogecoin experiencing a sharp monthly decline. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with increased integration and adoption, suggesting a preference for stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The bearish macroeconomic environment and recent price breakdown suggest reducing exposure to Bitcoin, despite some bullish momentum signals.

ETH: +0.2 — While Ethereum is in a technical consolidation phase, whale accumulation hints at potential upside, warranting a slight increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — Despite bullish momentum signals, Solana's year-to-date decline and current market conditions suggest caution and a slight reduction in exposure.

DOGE: -0.4 — With significant recent losses and bearish pressure, reducing exposure to Dogecoin is prudent, given the lack of strong support.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is advisable to preserve capital and mitigate risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, with macroeconomic uncertainties impacting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, nearing its 200-day moving average, and Ethereum is in a technical consolidation phase despite some whale accumulation. Solana, despite recent liquidity injections, continues to face downward pressure, while Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline over the past month. In contrast, USDT remains stable with increased integration and adoption, indicating a preference for safety amid volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is facing bearish macroeconomic conditions and technical breakdowns, with recent news highlighting significant price drops. Given current holdings, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite technical consolidation, whale accumulation suggests potential for a rally. Maintaining a slight positive bias is warranted to capitalize on any upward movement.

SOL: +0.3 — Despite a year-to-date decline, positive developments in the Solana ecosystem, such as the Solaxy L2 launch, provide a basis for cautious optimism.

DOGE: -0.3 — With a significant monthly loss and bearish pressure, reducing exposure is advisable, especially given the minimal current holdings.

USDT: +0.8 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a high allocation in USDT is strategic for capital preservation and potential redeployment when conditions improve."
2025-03-09 12:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Fed policy, which have led to a significant sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced notable declines, with Bitcoin nearing its 2025 lows. Despite this, Ethereum shows potential for recovery due to whale accumulation. Solana and Dogecoin are also under pressure, with Solana facing year-to-date losses and Dogecoin experiencing a sharp monthly drop. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with increased adoption and no negative events reported.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent sell-off and macroeconomic pressures suggest a bearish outlook. Despite holding BTC, reducing exposure is prudent given the lack of bullish signals and market uncertainties.

ETH: +0.3 — While the market is generally bearish, the whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound. Maintaining a slight positive allocation reflects this potential upside.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite some bullish signals, the overall bearish market sentiment and significant YTD losses suggest caution. Holding the current position without increasing exposure is advisable.

DOGE: -0.3 — With a sharp monthly decline and bearish sentiment, reducing exposure to DOGE is recommended, despite holding a minimal amount.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and liquidity, allowing for flexibility in future allocations."
2025-03-09 13:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum due to macroeconomic uncertainties and broader risk-off sentiment. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, nearing its 200-day moving average, and Ethereum is facing technical consolidation despite whale accumulation. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, while Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline over the past month. The macroeconomic environment, characterized by high volatility and economic concerns, is driving investors towards safer assets like stablecoins, reflected in the stable performance of USDT.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin is under pressure from macroeconomic factors and recent sell-offs, with technical indicators showing no bullish signals. Reducing exposure is prudent given the current bearish sentiment.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent declines, whale accumulation suggests potential for a rebound. However, technicals remain weak, warranting only a slight positive bias.

SOL: 0.0 — Solana's continued decline and lack of strong bullish signals suggest a neutral stance. The recent liquidity injection has not yet translated into positive price action.

DOGE: -0.3 — Dogecoin's significant monthly loss and bearish technical indicators justify reducing exposure, especially given its low current portfolio holding.

USDT: +0.6 — In a risk-off environment, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT is advisable to preserve capital and provide liquidity for future opportunities."
2025-03-09 14:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by heightened volatility and uncertainty, with broader economic concerns such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policy weighing on risk assets. This has led to a significant downturn in the crypto market, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable drop and Ethereum showing signs of potential accumulation by large holders. Solana continues to face challenges despite liquidity injections, while Dogecoin remains under bearish pressure. Tether, as a stablecoin, maintains its role as a safe haven amid market turbulence, with recent integrations expanding its use cases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite increased on-chain activity, Bitcoin's price is under significant pressure, with macroeconomic concerns and technical breakdowns suggesting a cautious approach.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, and while technical signals are mixed, the possibility of a rally warrants a moderate positive outlook.

SOL: -0.3 — Continued downward pressure and lack of positive momentum, despite ecosystem developments, suggest reducing exposure.

DOGE: 0.0 — While DOGE is near a support level, the overall bearish sentiment and lack of positive catalysts keep the outlook neutral.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and risk-off sentiment, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT provides stability and flexibility for future opportunities."

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment remains bearish, with significant price declines across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, nearing its 200-day moving average, while Ethereum shows potential for a rally due to whale accumulation despite its recent pullback. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin faces significant monthly losses, hovering near critical support levels. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with increased adoption through platform integrations.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The bearish macroeconomic context and recent price breakdown suggest reducing exposure, especially given the proximity to the 200-day moving average and lack of bullish signals.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent price declines, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, making it relatively more attractive in the current environment.

SOL: -0.3 — Continued price declines and underperformance despite liquidity boosts suggest reducing exposure, as there are no immediate catalysts for recovery.

DOGE: -0.2 — Significant monthly losses and bearish pressure warrant a cautious stance, with potential short-term support providing limited upside.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-03-09 16:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policy, which have led to significant declines in major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, testing its 2025 lows, while Ethereum's price is consolidating, with some whale accumulation hinting at a potential rally. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, and Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline, with mixed forecasts about its support level. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with increased adoption and integration, suggesting a preference for stability amid market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The bearish macroeconomic sentiment and recent price breakdown suggest reducing exposure, especially given the lack of bullish technical signals.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite the bearish market, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, warranting a cautious increase in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Continued price decline and lack of positive technical signals suggest reducing exposure, despite ecosystem developments.

DOGE: -0.4 — Significant monthly losses and bearish pressure indicate reducing exposure, as technical support levels remain uncertain.

USDT: +0.6 — In a bearish market environment, increasing exposure to stablecoins like USDT provides a safe haven and capital preservation opportunity."
2025-03-09 17:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines observed across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties and broader risk asset sell-offs. Ethereum, while also declining, shows some potential for recovery due to whale accumulation. Solana continues to struggle despite attempts to boost liquidity and address network congestion. Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline, with mixed forecasts suggesting potential short-term support but ongoing bearish pressure. Tether remains stable, with increased integration and adoption but no significant changes in its market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Bitcoin's price is under pressure due to macroeconomic concerns and recent sell-offs. The lack of bullish technical signals suggests reducing exposure.

ETH: +0.2 — Despite recent declines, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, warranting a cautious increase in allocation.

SOL: -0.3 — Continued downward trend and lack of positive technical indicators suggest reducing exposure, despite ongoing ecosystem developments.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed forecasts and recent significant declines create uncertainty, justifying a neutral stance.

USDT: +0.6 — In the current bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is prudent to preserve capital and manage risk."
2025-03-09 18:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, with significant declines across major cryptocurrencies, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties and broader risk-off sentiment. Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable sell-offs, with BTC nearing its 200-day moving average and ETH seeing whale accumulation, suggesting potential for a rebound. Solana and Dogecoin have also faced substantial losses, with SOL struggling despite liquidity injections and DOGE hovering near critical support levels. Meanwhile, USDT remains stable, benefiting from increased adoption and integration, serving as a safe haven amidst market volatility.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — Despite whale accumulation and potential for a rebound, BTC is under pressure from macroeconomic uncertainties and recent sell-offs, suggesting a cautious stance.

ETH: +0.3 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rally, and despite recent declines, ETH's technical consolidation provides a promising setup for a recovery.

SOL: -0.3 — Continued year-to-date decline and lack of immediate positive catalysts warrant a cautious approach, although long-term potential remains.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed forecasts and hovering near support levels suggest no clear directional bias, warranting a hold position.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, USDT serves as a stable asset, benefiting from increased adoption and providing a safe haven for capital preservation."
2025-03-09 19:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The current market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies, which have led to a significant sell-off across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, testing its 200-day moving average, while Ethereum shows potential for a rally due to whale accumulation despite recent price drops. Solana continues to struggle with a year-to-date decline, even with liquidity injections. Dogecoin has seen a sharp monthly decline, with mixed forecasts around its support levels. In contrast, USDT remains stable, with increased platform integrations expanding its use cases.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The bearish macroeconomic environment and recent price breakdowns suggest reducing exposure to BTC, despite on-chain activity surges.

ETH: +0.2 — While technical indicators are weak, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, warranting a slight increase in exposure.

SOL: -0.3 — Continued downward pressure and lack of positive momentum signals suggest reducing exposure, despite ecosystem developments.

DOGE: -0.1 — Persistent bearish pressure and recent declines justify a cautious stance, with minimal exposure reduction due to its small portfolio presence.

USDT: +0.7 — In a bearish market, maintaining higher USDT exposure is prudent to preserve capital and mitigate risk."

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment appears cautious with a bearish tilt, influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, testing its 200-day moving average, which indicates broader risk aversion. Ethereum shows potential for a turnaround due to whale accumulation, though it remains in a technical consolidation phase. Solana continues to struggle despite liquidity injections, reflecting broader market challenges. Dogecoin has faced a sharp decline over the past month, with mixed forecasts around its current support level. Meanwhile, Tether remains stable, with increased integration and adoption but no significant changes in its market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.3 — Despite recent price increases, Bitcoin's overall bearish sentiment and macroeconomic pressures suggest caution. Reduce exposure slightly.

ETH: +0.2 — Whale accumulation hints at potential upside, but technical consolidation warrants a cautious approach. Slightly increase exposure.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent price fluctuations, Solana's ongoing struggles and lack of clear bullish signals suggest holding current exposure.

DOGE: -0.1 — Continued bearish pressure and recent declines warrant a slight reduction in exposure, though the position is minimal.

USDT: +0.5 — Given the current market uncertainty and bearish sentiment across other assets, maintaining a higher allocation in USDT is prudent for stability."
2025-03-09 21:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

## Format your response as follows:

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is currently bearish, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties such as tariffs and Fed policy, which have led to significant sell-offs in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a notable drop, nearing its 200-day moving average, while Ethereum shows potential for a rally due to whale accumulation despite recent consolidation. Solana continues to face challenges despite liquidity boosts, and Dogecoin remains under pressure with significant monthly losses. In contrast, USDT maintains stability with increased integration and adoption, reflecting a cautious market environment where capital preservation is prioritized.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: -0.5 — The recent significant price drop and macroeconomic concerns suggest continued bearish pressure. Given the current holdings, reducing exposure is prudent.

ETH: +0.3 — Despite recent consolidation, whale accumulation indicates potential for a rebound, making it relatively more attractive compared to other assets.

SOL: 0.0 — Despite recent developments, Solana's year-to-date performance remains weak, and no strong signals suggest a change in direction.

DOGE: -0.1 — Continued bearish pressure and significant monthly losses warrant caution, but current holdings are minimal, so a slight reduction is advised.

USDT: +0.5 — In a bearish market environment, maintaining higher exposure to stablecoins like USDT is favorable for capital preservation and risk management."
2025-03-09 22:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.

### Market Summary

Briefly summarize overall market sentiment and important developments across assets (1–2 short paragraphs max).

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

List each asset and your allocation score, followed by a 1–2 sentence justification.

Example:

BTC: +0.7 — Strong upward momentum across price and on-chain flows. ETF-related news also supportive.

ETH: -0.2 — Sideways technicals and mixed sentiment after recent sell pressure.

SOL: +0.4 — Positive volume spike and DEX activity.

DOGE: 0.0 — No major changes in either data or sentiment.

USDT: -0.6 — Capital rotation out of stablecoins as risk appetite increases.","### Market Summary

The overall market sentiment is bearish, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties and recent sell-offs across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline, nearing its 200-day moving average, reflecting broader economic concerns such as tariffs and Federal Reserve policies. Ethereum, despite a recent dip, shows potential for a rally due to whale accumulation, indicating possible future gains. Solana continues to struggle with a year-to-date decline, despite efforts to enhance its ecosystem through liquidity injections and new developments. Dogecoin has seen a sharp decline over the past month, with mixed forecasts around its support levels. Tether remains stable, with increased integration activities but no significant changes in its market dynamics.

### Allocation Scores (Hourly Trading Signal)

BTC: +0.3 — Despite the recent sell-off, Bitcoin's proximity to its 200-day moving average and high on-chain activity suggest potential for a rebound. However, macroeconomic uncertainties warrant cautious optimism.

ETH: +0.5 — Whale accumulation indicates potential for a rally, and its technical consolidation around $2.2K provides a promising setup for future gains.

SOL: -0.2 — Continued year-to-date decline and lack of immediate positive catalysts suggest a cautious stance, despite recent ecosystem developments.

DOGE: 0.0 — Mixed forecasts and significant recent losses warrant a neutral stance, as the asset hovers around key support levels.

USDT: +0.4 — Given the current bearish market conditions, maintaining a higher allocation in stablecoins like USDT provides a hedge against volatility and preserves capital."
2025-03-09 23:00:00,"You are an experienced multi-asset crypto trading agent operating in an hourly trading system. Your task is to make short-term asset allocation decisions across five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT. Your goal is to maximize your overall profit.

For each hour, you are provided with:

1. **Macroeconomic Context:** This hour's macro indicators such as interest rates, oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, gold, the S&P 500, and volatility.
2. **Recent Market Data**: A chronological snapshot of the last 4 hours of market data, including pricing, technical indicators, and on-chain activity for each asset (from oldest to newest).
3. **Daily News Summaries**: Important news summaries for each asset, published on the same day, from sources such as CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, or Decrypt.
4. **Current Portfolio Status**: Your current holdings for each asset, including the quantity of BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and USDT.

## Objective:

Analyze both market data and news, based on your current portfolio holdings, to determine your **preferred allocation signal** for each asset in the current market environment.

Output a **score between -1.0 and 1.0** for each asset, representing your directional preference and confidence level:

- +1.0 = Strong buy signal / highest preference for allocating capital
- 0.0 = Neutral / hold / no clear signal
- -1.0 = Strong sell signal / reduce exposure (if you hold the asset)

This score does **not** represent an actual trade or position size, but reflects your intent to **increase, reduce, or hold** the asset. Your scores will be interpreted and executed by a separate portfolio rebalancer, which will use them to determine actual capital allocations. Wisely select the useful information, pay more attention to **long-term trends** instead of short-term benefits. Avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly.

When assigning allocation scores, do not avaluate each asset in isolation. Consider how each asset fits into an overall portfolio strategy, including cross-asset relationships and capital rotation. For example, in bearish market conditions, you may prefer to maintain higher USDT exposure, while in bullish conditions, more capital should be shifted into other assets. Your scores should reflect the **relative attractiveness** of each asset — prioritize those most deserving of capital based on both confidence and comparative appeal.

Aim to make stable, incremental changes to the portfolio. Avoid frequent, full reallocations unless the signal is strong and clearly supported by both data and news.

❗Only assign a negative score if you currently hold that asset. You cannot reduce exposure to assets that are not in your portfolio.
